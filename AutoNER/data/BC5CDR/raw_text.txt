Naloxone
reverses
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
clonidine
.

In
unanesthetized
,
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
the
decrease
in
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
produced
by
intravenous
clonidine
,
5
to
20
micrograms
/
kg
,
was
inhibited
or
reversed
by
nalozone
,
0.2
to
2
mg
/
kg
.

The
hypotensive
effect
of
100
mg
/
kg

alpha
-
methyldopa
was
also
partially
reversed
by
naloxone
.

Naloxone
alone
did
not
affect
either
blood
pressure
or
heart
rate
.

In
brain
membranes
from
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats

clonidine
,
10(-8
)
to
10(-5
)
M
,
did
not
influence
stereoselective
binding
of
[
3H]-naloxone

(
8
nM
)
,
and
naloxone
,
10(-8
)
to
10(-4
)

M
,
did
not
influence

clonidine

-suppressible
binding
of
[
3H]-dihydroergocryptine

(
1
nM
)
.

These
findings
indicate
that
in
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
the
effects
of
central
alpha
-
adrenoceptor
stimulation
involve
activation
of
opiate
receptors
.

As
naloxone
and
clonidine
do
not
appear
to
interact
with
the
same
receptor
site
,
the
observed
functional
antagonism
suggests
the
release
of
an
endogenous
opiate
by
clonidine
or
alpha
-
methyldopa
and
the
possible
role
of
the
opiate
in
the
central
control
of
sympathetic
tone
.

Lidocaine

.

Intravenous
administration
of
a
single
50-mg
bolus
of
lidocaine
in

man
resulted
in
profound
depression
of
the
activity
of
the
sinoatrial
and
atrioventricular
nodal
pacemakers
.

The
patient
had
no
apparent
associated
conditions
which
might
have
predisposed
him
to
the
development
of
bradyarrhythmias
;
and
,
thus
,
this
probably
represented
a
true
idiosyncrasy

to
36
adult
males
at
six
rates
:
0.25
mg
s-1
to
20

.

The
infusion
was
discontinued
either
when
there
was
no
muscular
response
to
tetanic
stimulation
of
the
ulnar
nerve
or
when
Sch
120
mg
was
exceeded
.

Six
additional
patients
received
a
30-mg
i.v
.

bolus
dose
.

Fasciculations
in
six
areas
of
the
body
were
scored
from
0
to
3
and
summated
as
a
total
fasciculation
score
.

The
times
to
first
fasciculation
,
twitch
suppression
and
tetanus
suppression
were
inversely
related
to
the
infusion
rates
.

Fasciculations
in
the
six
areas
and
the
total
fasciculation
score
were
related
directly
to
the
rate
of
infusion
.

Total
fasciculation
scores
in
the
30-mg
bolus
group
and
the
5-mg
s-1

were
not
significantly
different

Galanthamine

Effects
of
uninephrectomy
and
high
protein
feeding
on
lithium
-induced
chronic
renal
failure
in
rats
.

Rats
with
lithium

-induced

nephropathy
were
subjected
to
high
protein
(
HP
)
feeding
,
uninephrectomy
(
NX
)
or
a
combination
of
these
,
in
an
attempt
to
induce
glomerular
hyperfiltration
and
further
progression
of
renal
failure
.

Newborn
female
Wistar
rats
were
fed
a
lithium
-containing
diet
(
50
mmol
/
kg
)
for
8
weeks
and
then
randomized
to
normal
diet
,
HP
diet
(
40
vs.
19
%
)
,
NX
or
HP+NX
for
another
8
weeks
.

Corresponding
non-
lithium
pretreated
groups
were
generated
.

When
comparing
all
lithium
treated
versus
non-

lithium
-treated
groups
,
lithium
caused
a
reduction
in
glomerular
filtration
rate
(
GFR
)
without
significant
changes
in
effective
renal
plasma
flow
(
as
determined
by
a
marker
secreted
into
the
proximal
tubules
)
or
lithium
clearance
.

Consequently
,
lithium
pretreatment
caused
a
fall
in
filtration
fraction
and
an
increase
in
fractional
Li
excretion
.

Lithium
also
caused

proteinuria
and
systolic
hypertension
in
absence
of
glomerulosclerosis
.

HP
failed
to
accentuante
progression
of
renal
failure
and
in
fact
tended
to
increase
GFR
and
decrease
plasma
creatinine
levels
in
lithium
pretreated
rats
.

NX
caused
an
additive
deterioration
in
GFR
which
,
however
,
was
ameliorated
by
HP
.

NX+HP
caused
a
further
rise
in
blood
pressure
in
Li

-pretreated
rats
.

The
results
indicate
that
Li
-induced
nephropathy
,
even
when
the
GFR
is
only
modestly
reduced
,
is
associated
with
proteinuria
and
arterial
systolic
hypertension
.

In
this
model
of
chronic
renal
failure

the
decline
in
GFR
is
not
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
fall
in
effective
renal
plasma
flow
,
which
may
be
the
functional
expression
of
the
formation
of
nonfiltrating
atubular
glomeruli
.

The
fractional
reabsorption
of
tubular
fluid
by
the
proximal
tubules
is
reduced
,
leaving
the
distal
delivery
unchanged.(ABSTRACT

Treatment
of
Crohn
's
disease
with
fusidic
acid
:
an
antibiotic
with
immunosuppressive
properties
similar
to
cyclosporin
.

Fusidic
acid
is
an
antibiotic
with
T
-
cell
specific
immunosuppressive
effects
similar
to
those
of
cyclosporin
.

Because
of
the
need
for
the
development
of
new
treatments
for
Crohn
's
disease
,
a
pilot
study
was
undertaken
to
estimate
the
pharmacodynamics
and
tolerability
of
fusidic
acid
treatment
in
chronic
active
,
therapy
-
resistant
patients
.

Eight
Crohn
's
disease
patients
were
included
.

Fusidic
acid
was
administered
orally
in
a
dose
of
500
mg
t.d.s
.

and
the
treatment
was
planned
to
last
8
weeks
.

The
disease
activity
was
primarily
measured
by
a
modified
individual
grading
score
.

Five
of
8
patients
(
63
%
)
improved
during
fusidic
acid
treatment
:
3
at
two
weeks
and
2
after
four
weeks
.

There
were
no
serious
clinical
side
effects
,
but
dose
reduction
was
required
in
two
patients
because
of
nausea
.

Biochemically
,
an
increase
in
alkaline
phosphatases
was
noted
in
5
of
8
cases
(
63
%
)
,
and
the
greatest
increases
were
seen
in
those
who
had
elevated
levels
prior
to
treatment
.

All
reversed
to
pre
-
treatment
levels
after
cessation
of
treatment
.

The
results
of
this
pilot
study
suggest
that
fusidic
acid
may
be
of
benefit
in
selected
chronic
active
Crohn
's
disease
patients
in
whom
conventional
treatment
is
ineffective
.

Because
there
seems
to
exist
a
scientific
rationale
for
the
use
of
fusidic
acid
at
the
cytokine
level
in
inflammatory
bowel
disease
,
we
suggest
that
the
role
of
this
treatment
should
be
further
investigated
.

Electrocardiographic
evidence
of

injury
in
psychiatrically
hospitalized
cocaine
abusers

The
electrocardiograms
(
ECG
)
of
99
cocaine
-abusing
patients
were
compared
with
the
ECGs
of
50
schizophrenic
controls
.

Eleven
of
the
cocaine
abusers
and
none
of
the
controls
had
ECG
evidence
of
significant
myocardial

defined
as
myocardial
infarction
,

Sulpiride
-induced
tardive
dystonia
.

Sulpiride
is
a
selective
D2-receptor
antagonist
with
antipsychotic
and
antidepressant
properties
.

Although
initially
thought
to
be
free
of
extrapyramidal
side
effects
,
sulpiride
-induced
tardive
dyskinesia
and
parkinsonism
have
been
reported
occasionally
.

We
studied
a
37-year
-
old
man
who
developed
persistent
segmental
dystonia
within
2
months
after
starting
sulpiride
therapy
.

We
could
not
find
any
previous
reports
of
sulpiride

-induced

tardive
dystonia

Ocular
and
auditory
toxicity
in
hemodialyzed
patients
receiving
desferrioxamine
.

During
an
18-month
period
of
study
41
hemodialyzed
patients
receiving
desferrioxamine

(
10
-
40
mg
/
kg
BW/3
times
weekly
)

for
the
first
time
were
monitored
for
detection
of
audiovisual
toxicity
.

6
patients
presented
clinical
symptoms
of
visual
or
auditory
toxicity
.

Moreover
,
detailed
ophthalmologic
and
audiologic
studies
disclosed
abnormalities
in
7
more
asymptomatic
patients
.

Visual
toxicity
was
of
retinal
origin
and
was
characterized
by
a
tritan
-
type
dyschromatopsy
,
sometimes
associated
with
a
loss
of
visual
acuity
and
pigmentary
retinal
deposits
.

Auditory
toxicity
was
characterized
by
a
mid-
to
high
-
frequency
neurosensorial
hearing
loss
and
the
lesion
was
of
the
cochlear
type
.

Desferrioxamine
withdrawal
resulted
in
a
complete
recovery
of
visual
function
in
1
patient
and
partial
recovery
in
3
,
and
a
complete
reversal
of
hearing
loss
in
3
patients
and
partial
recovery
in
3
.

This
toxicity
appeared
in
patients
receiving
the
higher
doses
of
desferrioxamine
or
coincided
with
the
normalization
of
ferritin
or
aluminium
serum
levels
.

The
data
indicate
that
audiovisual
toxicity
is
not
an
infrequent
complication
in
hemodialyzed
patients
receiving
desferrioxamine
.

Periodical
audiovisual
monitoring
should
be
performed
on
hemodialyzed
patients
receiving
the
drug
in
order
to
detect
adverse
effects
as
early
as
possible
.

Myasthenia
gravis
presenting
as
weakness
after
magnesium
administration
.

We
studied
a
patient
with
no
prior
history
of
neuromuscular
disease
who
became
virtually
quadriplegic
after
parenteral
magnesium
administration
for
preeclampsia
.

The
serum
magnesium
concentration
was
3.0
mEq
/
L
,
which
is
usually
well
tolerated
.

The
magnesium
was
stopped
and
she
recovered
over
a
few
days
.

While
she
was
weak
,
2-Hz
repetitive
stimulation
revealed
a
decrement
without
significant
facilitation
at
rapid
rates
or
after
exercise
,
suggesting
postsynaptic
neuromuscular
blockade
.

After
her
strength
returned
,
repetitive
stimulation
was
normal
,
but
single
fiber
EMG
revealed
increased
jitter
and
blocking
.

Her
acetylcholine
receptor
antibody
level
was
markedly
elevated
.

Although
paralysis
after
magnesium
administration
has
been
described
in
patients
with
known
myasthenia
gravis
,
it
has
not
previously
been
reported
to
be
the
initial
or
only
manifestation
of
the
disease
.

Patients
who
are
unusually
sensitive
to
the
neuromuscular
effects
of
magnesium
should
be
suspected
of
having
an
underlying
disorder
of
neuromuscular
transmission
.

Chloroacetaldehyde
and
its
contribution
to
urotoxicity
during
treatment
with
cyclophosphamide
or
ifosfamide
.

An
experimental
study
/
short
communication
.

Based
on
clinical
data
,
indicating
that
chloroacetaldehyde

(
CAA
)
is
an
important
metabolite
of
oxazaphosphorine
cytostatics
,
an
experimental
study
was
carried
out
in
order
to
elucidate
the
role
of
CAA
in
the
development
of
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

The
data
demonstrate
that
CAA
after
i.v
.

administration
does
not
contribute
to
bladder
damage
.

When
instilled
directly
into
the
bladder
,
CAA
exerts
urotoxic
effects
,
it
is
,
however
,
susceptible
to
detoxification

Source
of
pain
and
primitive
dysfunction
in
migraine
:
an
identical
site
?

Twenty
common
migraine
patients
received
a
one
sided
frontotemporal
application
of
nitroglycerin

(
10
patients
)
or
placebo
ointment
(
10
patients
)
in
a
double
blind
study
.

Early
onset
migraine
attacks
were
induced
by
nitroglycerin
in
seven
out
of
10
patients
versus
no
patient
in
the
placebo
group
.

Subsequently
20
migraine
patients
,
who
developed
an
early
onset
attack
with
frontotemporal
nitroglycerin
,
received
the
drug
in
a
second
induction
test
at
other
body
areas
.

No
early
onset

migraine
was
observed
.

Thus
the
migraine
-inducing
effect
of
nitroglycerin
seems
to
depend
on
direct
stimulation
of
the
habitual
site
of
pain
,
suggesting
that
the
frontotemporal
region
is
of
crucial
importance
in
the
development
of
a
migraine
crisis
.

This
is
not
consistent
with
a
CNS
origin
of
migraine
attack
.

Clotiazepam
-induced
acute
hepatitis
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
patient
who
developed
acute
hepatitis
with
extensive
hepatocellular
necrosis
,
7
months
after
the
onset
of
administration
of
clotiazepam
,
a
thienodiazepine
derivative
.

Clotiazepam
withdrawal
was
followed
by
prompt
recovery
.

The
administration
of
several
benzodiazepines
,
chemically
related
to
clotiazepam
,
did
not
interfere
with
recovery
and
did
not
induce
any
relapse
of
hepatitis
.

This
observation
shows
that
clotiazepam
can
induce
acute
hepatitis
and
suggests
that
there
is
no
cross
hepatotoxicity
between
clotiazepam
and
several
benzodiazepines
.

Arterial
hypertension
as
a
complication
of
prolonged
ketoconazole
treatment
.

Two
of
14
patients
with
Cushing
's
syndrome
treated
on
a
long
-
term
basis
with
ketoconazole
developed
sustained
hypertension
.

In
both
cases
normal
plasma
and
urinary
free
cortisol
levels
had
been
achieved
following
ketoconazole
therapy
,
yet
continuous
blood
pressure
monitoring
demonstrated
hypertension
31
(
patient
1
)
and
52
weeks
(
patient
2
)
after
treatment
.

In
patient
1
,
plasma
levels
of
deoxycorticosterone
and
11-deoxycortisol
were
elevated
.

In
patient
2
,
in
addition
to
an
increase
in
both
deoxycorticosterone
and
11-deoxycortisol
levels
,
plasma
aldosterone
values
were
raised
,
with
a
concomitant
suppression
of
renin
levels
.

Our
findings
show
that
long
-
term
treatment
with
high
doses
of
ketoconazole
may
induce
enzyme
blockade
leading
to
mineralocorticoid
-
related
hypertension
.

Effects
of
an
inhibitor
of
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
(
Captopril
)
on
pulmonary
and
renal
insufficiency
due
to
intravascular
coagulation
in
the
rat
.

Induction
of
intravascular
coagulation
and
inhibition
of
fibrinolysis
by
injection
of
thrombin
and
tranexamic
acid

(
AMCA
)
in
the
rat
gives
rise
to
pulmonary
and
renal
insufficiency
resembling
that
occurring
after
trauma
or
sepsis
in
man
.

Injection
of
Captopril

(
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
,
reduced
both
pulmonary
and
renal
insufficiency
in
this
rat
model
.

The
lung
weights
were
lower
and
PaO2
was
improved
in
rats
given
this
enzyme
-
blocking
agent
.

The
contents
of
albumin
in
the
lungs
were
not
changed
,
indicating
that
Captopril
did
not
influence
the
extravasation
of
protein
.

Renal
damage
as
reflected
by
an
increase
in
serum
urea
and
in
kidney
weight
was
prevented
by
Captopril
.

The
amount
of
fibrin
in
the
kidneys
was
also
considerably
lower
than
in
animals
which
received
thrombin
and
AMCA
alone
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
effects
of
Captopril
on
the
lungs
may
be
attributable
to
a
vasodilatory
effect
due
to
a
reduction
in
the
circulating
level
of
Angiotension
II
and
an
increase
in
prostacyclin

(
secondary
to
an
increase
in
bradykinin
)
.

Captopril
may
,
by
the
same
mechanism
,
reduce
the
increase
in
glomerular
filtration
that
is
known
to
occur
after
an
injection
of
thrombin
,
thereby
diminishing
the
aggregation
of
fibrin
monomers
in
the
glomeruli
,
with
the
result
that
less
fibrin
will
be
deposited
and
thus
less

kidney
damage
will
be
produced
.

A
randomized
comparison
of
labetalol
and
nitroprusside
for
induced
hypotension
.

In
a
randomized
study
,
labetalol
-induced
hypotension
and

nitroprusside
-induced

hypotension
were
compared
in
20
patients
(
10
in
each
group
)
scheduled
for
major
orthopedic
procedures
.

Each
patient
was
subjected
to
an
identical
anesthetic
protocol
and
similar
drug
-
induced
reductions
in
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
(
50
to
55
mmHg
)
.

Nitroprusside
infusion
was
associated
with
a
significant
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
increase
in
heart
rate
and
cardiac
output
;
rebound

hypertension
was
observed
in
three
patients
after
discontinuation
of
nitroprusside
.

Labetalol
administration
was
not
associated
with
any
of
these
findings
.

Arterial
PO2
decreased
in
both
groups
.

It
was
concluded
that
labetalol
offers
advantages
over
nitroprusside
.

Folate
depletion
has
often
been
a
problem
in
chronic
antiepileptic
drug
(
AED
)
therapy
.

Carbamazepine

(
CBZ
)
,
a
commonly
used
AED
,
has
been
implicated
in
some
clinical
studies
.

A
rat
model
was
developed
to
examine
the
effects
of
chronic
CBZ
treatment
on
folate
concentrations
in
the
rat
.

In
the
course
of
developing
this
model
,
a
common
vehicle
,
propylene
glycol
,
by
itself
in
high
doses
,
was
found
to
exhibit
protective
properties
against
induced
seizures
and
inhibited
weight
gain
.

Seizures
induced
by
hexafluorodiethyl
ether

(
HFDE
)
were
also
found
to
be
a
more
sensitive
measure
of
protection
by
CBZ
than
seizures
induced
by
maximal
electroshock
(
MES
)
.

Oral
administration
of
CBZ
as
an
aqueous
suspension
every
8
h
at
a
dose
of
250
mg
/
kg
was
continuously
protective
against
HFDE

-induced

seizures
and
was
minimally
toxic
as
measured
by
weight
gain
over
8
weeks
of
treatment
.

The
CBZ
levels
measured
in
plasma
and
brain
of
these
animals
,
however
,
were
below
those
normally
considered
protective
.

This
treatment
with
CBZ
had
no
apparent
adverse
effect
on
folate
concentrations
in
the
rat
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
folate
concentration
increased
in
liver
after
6
weeks
of
treatment
and
in
plasma
at
8
weeks
of
treatment
.

Death
from
chemotherapy
in
gestational
trophoblastic
disease
.

Multiple
cytotoxic
drug
administration
is
the
generally
accepted
treatment
of
patients
with
a
high
-
risk
stage
of
choriocarcinoma
.

Based
on
this
principle
a
27-year
old
woman
,
classified
as
being
in
the
high
-
risk
group
(
Goldstein
and
Berkowitz
score
:
11
)
,
was
treated
with
multiple
cytotoxic
drugs
.

The
multiple
drug
schema
consisted
of
:
Etoposide
16.213
,
Methotrexate
,
Cyclophosphamide
,
Actomycin
-
D
,
and
Cisplatin
.

On
the
first
day
of
the
schedule
,
moderate
high
doses
of
Methotrexate
,

Etoposide
and
Cyclophosphamide
were
administered
.

Within
8
hours
after
initiation
of
therapy
the
patient
died
with
a
clinical
picture
resembling
massive
pulmonary
obstruction
due
to
choriocarcinomic
tissue
plugs
,
probably
originating
from
the
uterus
.

Formation
of
these
plugs
was
probably
due
to
extensive
tumor

necrosis
at
the
level
of
the
walls
of
the
major
uterine
veins
,
which
resulted
in
an
open
exchange
of
tumor
plugs
to
the
vascular
spaces
;
decrease
in
tumor
tissue
coherence
secondary
to
chemotherapy
may
have
further
contributed
to
the
formation
of
tumor
emboli
.

In
view
of
the
close
time
association
between
the
start
of
chemotherapy
and
the
acute
onset
of
massive
embolism
other
explanations
,
such
as
spontaneous
necrosis
,
must
be
considered
less
likely
.

Patients
with
large
pelvic
tumor
loads
are
,
according
to
existing
classifications
,
at
high
risk
to
die
and
to
develop
drug
resistance
.

Notwithstanding
these
facts
our
findings
suggest
that
these
patients
might
benefit
from
relatively
mild
initial
treatment
,
especially
true
for
patients
not
previously
exposed
to
this
drug
.

Close
observation
of
the
response
status
both
clinically
and
with
beta
-
hCG
values
may
indicate
whether
and
when
more
agressive
combination
chemotherapy
should
be
started.(ABSTRACT

Sexual
dysfunction
among
patients
with
arthritis
.

The
relationship
of
arthritis
and
sexual
dysfunction
was
investigated
among
169
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
osteoarthritis
and
spondyloarthropathy
,
130
of
whom
were
pair
-
matched
to
controls
.

Assessments
of
marital
happiness
and
depressed
mood
were
also
made
using
the
CES
-
D
and
the
Azrin
Marital
Happiness
Scale
(
AMHS
)
.

Sexual
dysfunctions
were
found
to
be
common
among
patients
and
controls
,
the
majority
in
both
groups
reporting
one
or
more
dysfunctions
.

Impotence
was
more
common
among
male
patients
than
controls
and
was
found
to
be
associated
with
co
-
morbidity
and
the
taking
of
methotrexate
.

Depressed
mood
was
more
common
among
patients
and
was
associated
with
certain
sexual
difficulties
,
but
not
with
impotence
.

Marital
unhappiness
,
as
indicated
by
AMHS
scores
,
was
not
associated
with
arthritis
but
was
associated
with
sexual
dysfunction
,
sexual
dissatisfaction
and
being
female

Does
paracetamol
cause

urothelial
cancer
or
renal
papillary
necrosis
?

The
risk
of
developing
renal
papillary
necrosis
or
cancer
of
the
renal
pelvis
,
ureter
or
bladder
associated
with
consumption
of
either
phenacetin
or
paracetamol
was
calculated
from
data
acquired
by
questionnaire
from
381
cases
and
808
controls
.

The
risk
of
renal
papillary
necrosis
was
increased
nearly
20-fold
by
consumption
of
phenacetin
,
which
also
increased
the
risk
for
cancer
of
the
renal
pelvis
and
bladder
but
not
for
ureteric
cancer
.

By
contrast
,
we
were
unable
to
substantiate
an
increased
risk
from
paracetamol
consumption
for
renal
papillary
necrosis
or
any
of
these
cancers

although
there
was
a
suggestion
of
an
association
with
cancer
of
the
ureter

Dapsone
-associated
Heinz
body

hemolytic
anemia
in
a
Cambodian
woman
with
hemoglobin
E
trait
.

A
Cambodian
woman
with
hemoglobin
E
trait
(
AE
)
and

leprosy
developed
a
Heinz
body
hemolytic
anemia
while
taking
a
dose
of
dapsone

(
50
mg
/
day
)
not
usually
associated
with
clinical
hemolysis
.

Her
red
blood
cells
(
RBCs
)
had
increased
incubated
Heinz
body
formation
,
decreased
reduced
glutathione

(
GSH
)
,
and
decreased
GSH
stability
.

The
pentose
phosphate
shunt
activity
of
the
dapsone
-exposed
AE
RBCs
was
increased
compared
to
normal
RBCs
.

Although
the
AE
RBCs
from
an
individual
not
taking
dapsone
had
increased
incubated
Heinz
body
formation
,
the
GSH
content
and
GSH
stability
were
normal
.

The
pentose
phosphate
shunt
activity
of
the
non-
dapsone
-exposed
AE
RBCs
was
decreased
compared
to
normal
RBCs
.

Thus
,
AE
RBCs
appear
to
have
an
increased
sensitivity
to
oxidant
stress
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
since
dapsone
does
not
cause
hemolytic
anemia
at
this
dose
in
hematologically
normal
individuals
.

Given
the
influx
of
Southeast
Asians
into
the
United
States
,
oxidant
medications
should
be
used
with
caution
,
especially
if
an
infection
is
present
,
in
individuals
of
ethnic
backgrounds
that
have
an
increased
prevalence
of
hemoglobin
E.

Severe
complications
of
antianginal
drug
therapy
in
a
patient
identified
as
a
poor
metabolizer
of
metoprolol
,
propafenone
,
diltiazem
,
and
sparteine
.

A
47-year
-
old
patient
suffering
from
coronary
artery
disease
was
admitted
to
the
CCU
in
shock
with
III
.

AV
block
,
severe
hypotension
,
and
impairment
of
ventricular
function
.

One
week
prior
to
admission
a
therapy
with
standard
doses
of
metoprolol

(
100
mg
t.i.d
.

and
then
100
mg
b.i.d
.
)
had
been
initiated
.

Two
days
before
admission
diltiazem

(
60
mg
b.i.d
.
)
was
prescribed
in
addition
.

Analyses
of
a
blood
sample
revealed
unusually
high
plasma
concentrations
of
metoprolol

(
greater
than
3000
ng
/
ml
)
and
diltiazem
(
526
ng
/
ml
)
.

The
patient
recovered
within
1
week
following
discontinuation
of
antianginal
therapy
.

Three
months
later
the
patient
was
exposed
to
a
single
dose
of
metoprolol
,
diltiazem
,

propafenone

(
since
he
had
received
this
drug
in
the
past
)
,
and
sparteine
(
as
a
probe
for
the
debrisoquine
/
sparteine
type
polymorphism
of
oxidative
drug
metabolism
)
.

It
was
found
that
he
was
a
poor
metabolizer
of
all
four
drugs
,
indicating
that
their
metabolism
is
under
the
same
genetic
control
.

Therefore
,
patients
belonging
to
the
poor
-
metabolizer
phenotype
of
sparteine
/
debrisoquine
polymorphism
in
drug
metabolism
,
which
constitutes
6.4
%
of
the
German
population
,
may
experience
adverse
drug
reactions
when
treated
with
standard
doses
of
one
of
these
drugs
alone
.

Moreover
,
the
coadministration
of
these
frequently
used
drugs
is
expected
to
be
especially
harmful
in
this
subgroup
of
patients
.

Triazolam
-induced
brief
episodes
of
secondary
mania
in
a
depressed

Large

.

Features
of

(
delirium
)
were
not
present

Manic

was
coincident
with
the
duration

The
possible

On
the
mechanisms
of
the
development
of
tolerance
to
the
muscular
rigidity
produced
by
morphine
in
rats
.

The
development
of
tolerance
to
the
muscular
rigidity
produced
by
morphine
was
studied
in
rats
.

Saline
-
pretreated
controls
given
a
test
dose
of
morphine

(
20
mg
/
kg
i.p
.

)
showed
a
pronounced
rigidity
recorded
as
tonic
activity
in
the
electromyogram
.

Rats
treated
for
11
days
with
morphine
and
withdrawn
for
36
-
40
h
showed
differences
in
the
development
of
tolerance
:
about
half
of
the
animals
showed
a
rigidity
after
the
test
dose
of
morphine

that
was
not
significantly
less
than
in
the
controls
and
were
akinetic

(
A
group
)
.

The
other
rats
showed
a
strong
decrease
in
the
rigidity
and
the
occurrence
of
stereotyped
(
S
)
licking
and/or
gnawing
in
presence
of
akinetic
or
hyperkinetic

(
K
)
behaviour
(
AS
/
KS
group
)
,
suggesting
signs
of
dopaminergic
activation
.

The
rigidity
was
considerably
decreased
in
both
groups
after
20
days
'
treatment
.

In
a
further
series
of
experiments
,
haloperidol
(
0.2
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
was
used
in
order
to
block
the
dopaminergic
activation
and
to
estimate
the
real
degree
of
the
tolerance
to
the
rigidity
without
any
dopaminergic
interference
.

Haloperidol
enhanced
the
rigidity
in
the
A
group
.

However
,
the
level
in
the
AS
/
KS
group
remained
considerably
lower
than
in
the
A
group
.

The
results
suggest
that
rigidity
,
which
is
assumed
to
be
due
to
an
action
of
morphine
in
the
striatum
,
can
be
antagonized
by
another
process
leading
to
dopaminergic
activation
in
the
striatum
.

Nevertheless
,
there
occurs
some
real
tolerance
to
this
effect
.

The
rapid
alternations
of
rigidity
and
the
signs
of
dopaminergic
activation
observed
in
the
animals
of
the
AS
/
KS
group
might
be
due
to
rapid
shifts
in
the
predominance
of
various
DA
-
innervated
structures
.

Compression
neuropathy
of
the
radial
nerve
due
to

pentazocine
-induced

fibrous
myopathy
.

Fibrous
myopathy
is
a
common
,
well
-
known
side
effect
of
repeated
pentazocine
injection
.

However
,
compression
neuropathy
due
to
fibrotic
muscle
affected
by
pentazocine
-induced

myopathy
has
not
previously
been
reported
.

In
a
37-year
-
old
woman
with
documented
pentazocine
-induced

fibrous
myopathy
of
triceps
and
deltoid
muscles
bilaterally
and
a
three
-
week
history
of
right
wrist
drop

,
electrodiagnostic
examination
showed
a
severe
but
partial
lesion
of
the
right
radial
nerve
distal
to
the
branches
to
the
triceps
,
in
addition
to
the
fibrous
myopathy
.

Surgery
revealed
the
right
radial
nerve
to
be
severely
compressed
by
the
densely
fibrotic
lateral
head
of
the
triceps
.

Decompression
and
neurolysis
were
performed
with
good
subsequent
recovery
of
function
.

Recurrent
reversible
acute
renal
failure
from
amphotericin
.

A
patient
with
cryptogenic
cirrhosis
and
disseminated
sporotrichosis
developed

acute
renal
failure
immediately
following
the
administration
of
amphotericin
B
on
four
separate
occasions
.

The
abruptness
of
the
renal
failure
and
its
reversibility
within
days
suggests
that
there
was
a
functional
component
to
the
renal
dysfunction
.

We
propose
that
amphotericin
,
in
the
setting
of
reduced
effective
arterial
volume
,
may
activate
tubuloglomerular
feedback
,
thereby
contributing
to
acute
renal
failure
.

Pneumonitis
with
pleural
and
pericardial
effusion
and
neuropathy
during
amiodarone
therapy
.

A
patient
with
sinuatrial
disease
and
implanted
pacemaker
was
treated
with
amiodarone

(
maximum
dose
1000
mg
,
maintenance
dose
800
mg
daily
)
for
10
months
,
for
control
of
supraventricular
tachyarrhythmias
.

He
developed
pneumonitis
,
pleural
and
pericardial
effusions
,
and
a
predominantly
proximal
motor
neuropathy
.

Immediate
but
gradual
improvement
followed
withdrawal
of
amiodarone
and
treatment
with
prednisolone
.

Review
of
this
and
previously
reported
cases
indicates
the
need
for
early
diagnosis
of
amiodarone
pneumonitis
,
immediate
withdrawal
of
amiodarone
,
and
prompt
but
continued
steroid
therapy
to
ensure
full
recovery
.

Indomethacin
-induced
renal
insufficiency
:
recurrence
on
rechallenge
.

We
have
reported
a
case
of
acute
oliguric
renal
failure
with
hyperkalemia
in
a
patient
with
cirrhosis
,
ascites
,
and
cor
pulmonale
after
indomethacin
therapy
.

Prompt
restoration
of
renal
function
followed
drug
withdrawal
,
while
re
-
exposure
to
a
single
dose
of
indomethacin
caused
recurrence
of
acute
reversible
oliguria
.

Our
case
supports
the
hypothesis
that
endogenous
renal
prostaglandins
play
a
role
in
the
maintenance
of
renal
blood
flow
when
circulating
plasma
volume
is
diminished
.

Since
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
agents
interfere
with
this
compensatory
mechanism
and
may
cause
acute
renal
failure
,
they
should
be
used
with
caution
in
such
patients
.

Comparison

sedation
which
increased
with
the
dose
,
2
mg
producing
deep
sleep
although
the
subjects
could
still
be
aroused
.

The
effects
of
i.m
.

administration
were
apparent
earlier
and
sometimes
lasted
longer
than
those
following
oral
administration
.

Dizziness
was
less
marked
than
sedation
,
but
increased
with
the
dose
.

There
was
pain
on
i.m
.

injection
of
flunitrazepam
significantly
more
often
than
with
isotonic
saline
.

Plasma
concentrations
varied
with
dose
and
route
and
corresponded
qualitatively
with
the
subjective
effects
.

The
drug
was
still
present
in
measurable
quantities
after
24
h
even
with
the
smallest
dose
.

Changes
in
heart
size
during
long
-
term
timolol
treatment
after
myocardial
infarction
.

The
effect
of
long
-
term
timolol
treatment
on
heart
size
after
myocardial
infarction
was
evaluated
by
X
-
ray
in
a
double
-
blind
study
including
241
patients
(
placebo
126
,
timolol
115
)
.

The
follow
-
up
period
was
12
months
.

The
timolol

-treated
patients
showed
a
small
but
significant
increase
in
heart
size
from
baseline
in
contrast
to
a
decrease
in
the
placebo
group
.

These
differences
may
be
caused
by
timolol

-induced

bradycardia
and
a
compensatory
increase
in
end
-
diastolic
volume
.

The
timolol
-related
increase
in
heart
size
was
observed
only
in
patients
with
normal
and
borderline
heart
size
.

In
patients
with
cardiomegaly
,
the
increase
in
heart
size
was
similar
in
both
groups
.

After
re-

infarction
,
heart
size
increased
in
the
placebo
group
and
remained
unchanged
in
the
timolol
group
.

Vitamin
D3
toxicity
in
dairy
cows
.

Large
parenteral
doses
of
vitamin
D3

(
15
to
17.5
x
10(6
)
IU
vitamin
D3
)
were
associated
with
prolonged
hypercalcemia
,
hyperphosphatemia
,
and
large
increases
of
vitamin
D3
and
its
metabolites
in
the
blood
plasma
of
nonlactating
nonpregnant
and
pregnant
Jersey
cows
.

Calcium
concentrations
1
day
postpartum
were
higher
in
cows
treated
with
vitamin
D3

about
32
days
prepartum
(
8.8
mg/100
ml
)
than
in
control
cows
(
5.5
mg/100
ml
)
.

None
of
the
cows
treated
with
vitamin
D3
showed
signs
of
milk
fever
during
the
peripartal
period
;
however
,
22
%
of
the
control
cows
developed
clinical
signs
of
milk
fever
during
this
period
.

Signs
of
vitamin
D3

toxicity
were
not
observed
in
nonlactating
nonpregnant
cows
;
however
,
pregnant
cows
commonly
developed
severe
signs
of
vitamin
D3
toxicity
and
10
of
17
cows
died
.

There
was
widespread
metastatic
calcification
in
the
cows
that
died
.

Because
of
the
extreme
toxicity
of
vitamin
D3
in
pregnant
Jersey
cows
and
the
low
margin
of
safety
between
doses
of
vitamin
D3
that
prevent
milk
fever
and
doses
that
induce
milk
fever
,
we
concluded
that
vitamin
D3
can
not
be
used
practically
to
prevent
milk
fever
when
injected
several
weeks
prepartum
.

Diseases
of
peripheral
nerves
as
seen
in
the
Nigerian
African
.

The
anatomical
and
aetiological
diagnoses
of
peripheral
nerve
disease
excluding
its
primary
benign
and
malignant
disorders
,
as
seen
in
358
Nigerians
are
presented
.

There
is
a
male
preponderance
and
the
peak
incidence
is
in
the
fourth
decade
.

Sensori
-
motor
neuropathy
was
the
commonest
presentation
(
50
%
)
.

Guillain
-
Barr
syndrome
was
the
commonest
identifiable
cause
(
15.6
%
)
,
accounting
for
half
of
the
cases
with
motor
neuropathy
.

Peripheral
neuropathy
due
to
nutritional
deficiency
of
thiamine
and
riboflavin
was
common
(
10.1
%
)
and
presented
mainly
as
sensory
and
sensori
-
motor
neuropathy
.

Diabetes
mellitus
was
the
major
cause
of
autonomic
neuropathy
.

Isoniazid
was
the
most
frequent
agent
in
drug
-
induced
neuropathy
.

Migraine
(
20
%
)
was
not
an
uncommon
cause
of
cranial
neuropathy

although

malignancies
arising
from
the
reticuloendothelial
system
or
related
structures
of
the
head
and
neck
were
more
frequent
(
26
%
)
.

In
26.5
%
of
all
the
cases
,
the
aetiology
of
the
neuropathy
was
undetermined
.

Heredofamilial
and
connective
tissue
disorders
were
rare
.

Some
of
the
factors
related
to
the
clinical
presentation
and
pathogenesis
of
the
neuropathies
are
briefly
discussed
.

A
double
-
blind
study
of
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
dothiepin
hydrochloride
in
the
treatment
of
major
depressive
disorder
.

In
a
6-week
double
-
blind
parallel
treatment
study
,
dothiepin
and
amitriptyline
were
compared
to
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
33
depressed
outpatients
.

Dothiepin
and
amitriptyline
were
equally
effective
in
alleviating
the
symptoms
of
depressive
illness
,
and
both
were
significantly
superior
to
placebo
.

The
overall
incidence
of
side
effects
and
the
frequency
and
severity
of
blurred
vision
,
dry
mouth
,
and
drowsiness
were
significantly
less
with
dothiepin
than
with
amitriptyline
.

Dothiepin
also
produced
fewer
CNS
and
cardiovascular
effects
.

There
were
no
clinically
important
changes
in
laboratory
parameters
.

Dothiepin
thus
was
found
to
be
an
effective
antidepressant
drug
associated
with
fewer
side
effects
than
amitriptyline
in
the
treatment
of
depressed
outpatients
.

Behavioral
effects
of
diazepam
and
propranolol
in
patients
with
panic
disorder
and
agoraphobia
.

The
effects
of
oral
doses
of
diazepam

(
single
dose
of
10
mg
and
a
median
dose
of
30
mg
/
day
for
2
weeks
)
and
propranolol

(
single
dose
of
80
mg
and
a
median
dose
of
240
mg
/
day
for
2
weeks
)
on
psychological
performance
of
patients
with

panic
disorders
and
agoraphobia
were
investigated
in
a
double
-
blind
,
randomized
and
crossover
design
.

Both
drugs
impaired
immediate
free
recall
but
the
decrease
was
greater
for
diazepam
than
propranolol
.

Delayed
free
recall
was
also
impaired
but
the
two
drugs
did
not
differ
.

Patients
tapped
faster
after
propranolol
than
diazepam
and
they
were
more
sedated
after
diazepam
than
propranolol
.

After
2
weeks
of
treatment
,
patients
tested
5
-
8
h
after
the
last
dose
of
medication
did
not
show
any
decrement
of
performance
.

These
results
are
similar
to
those
previously
found
in
healthy
subjects
.

Accumulation
of
drugs
was
not
reflected
in
prolonged
behavioral
impairment
.

Effect
of
aspirin
on
N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide
-induced
epithelial
proliferation
in
the
urinary
bladder
and
forestomach
of
the
rat
.

The
co
-
administration
of
aspirin
with
N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide

(
FANFT
)
to
rats
resulted
in
a
reduced
incidence
of
FANFT
-induced
bladder
carcinomas
but
a
concomitant
induction
of
forestomach
tumors
.

An
autoradiographic
study
was
performed
on
male
F-344
rats
fed
diet
containing
FANFT
at
a
level
of
0.2
%
and/or
aspirin
at
a
level
of
0.5
%
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
aspirin
on
the
increased
cell
proliferation
induced
by
FANFT
in
the
forestomach
and
bladder
.

FANFT
-induced
cell
proliferation
in
the
bladder
was
significantly
suppressed
by
aspirin
co
-
administration
after
4
weeks
but
not
after
12
weeks
.

In
the
forestomach
,
and
also
in
the
liver
,
aspirin
did
not
affect
the
FANFT

-induced
increase
in
labeling
index
.

The
present
results
are
consistent
with
the
carcinogenicity
experiment
suggesting
that
different
mechanisms
are
involved
in
FANFT
carcinogenesis
in
the
bladder
and
forestomach
,
and
that
aspirin
's
effect
on
FANFT
in
the
forestomach
is
not
due
to
an
irritant
effect
associated
with
increased
cell
proliferation
.

Also
,
there
appears
to
be
an
adaptation
by
the
rats
to
the
chronic
ingestion
of
aspirin
.

Provocation
of
postural
hypotension
by
nitroglycerin
in
diabetic
autonomic
neuropathy
?

The
effect
of
nitroglycerin
on
heart
rate
and
systolic
blood
pressure
was
compared
in
5
normal
subjects
,
12
diabetic
subjects
without
autonomic
neuropathy
,
and
5
diabetic
subjects
with
autonomic
neuropathy
.

The
magnitude
and
time
course
of
the
increase
in
heart
rate
and
the
decrease
in
systolic
blood
pressure
after
nitroglycerin
were
similar
in
the
normal
and
diabetic
subjects
without
autonomic
neuropathy
,
whereas
a
lesser
increase
in
heart
rate
and
a
greater
decrease
in
systolic
blood
pressure
occurred
in
the
diabetic
subjects
with
autonomic
neuropathy
.

It
is
therefore
suggested
that
caution
should
be
exercised
when
prescribing
vasodilator
drugs
in
diabetic
patients
,
particularly
those
with
autonomic
neuropathy
.

Characterization
of
estrogen
-induced
adenohypophyseal
tumors
in
the
Fischer
344
rat
.

Pituitary
tumors
were
induced
in
F344
female
rats
by
chronic
treatment
with
diethylstilbestrol

(
DES
,
8
-
10
mg
)
implanted
subcutaneously
in
silastic
capsules
.

Over
a
range
of
1
-
150
days
of
DES
treatment
,
pairs
of
control
and
DES
-treated
rats
were
sacrificed
,
and
their
pituitaries
dissociated
enzymatically
into
single
-
cell
preparations
.

The
cell
populations
were
examined
regarding
total
cell
recovery
correlated
with
gland
weight
,
intracellular
prolactin
(
PRL
)
content
and
subsequent
release
in
primary
culture
,
immunocytochemical
PRL
staining
,
density
and/or
size
alterations
via
separation
on
Ficoll
-
Hypaque
and
by
unit
gravity
sedimentation
,
and
cell
cycle
analysis
,
after
acriflavine
DNA
staining
,
by
laser
flow
cytometry
.

Total
cell
yields
from
DES

-treated
pituitaries
increased
from
1.3
times
control
yields
at
8
days
of
treatment
to
58.9
times
control
values
by
day
150
.

Intracellular
PRL
content
ranged
from
1.9
to
9.4
times
control
levels
,
and
PRL
release
in
vitro
was
significantly
and
consistently
higher
than
controls
,
after
at
least
8
days
of
DES
exposure
.

Beyond
8
days
of
DES
exposure
,
the
immunochemically
PRL
-
positive
proportion
of
cells
increased
to
over
50
%
of
the
total
population
.

Increased
density
and/or
size
and
PRL
content
were
indicated
for
the
majority
of
the
PRL
cell
population
in
both
types
of
separation
protocols
.

All
these
effects
of
DES
were
more
pronounced
among
previously
ovariectomized
animals
.

The
data
extend
the
findings
of
other
investigators
,
further
establishing
the
DES
-induced

tumor
as
a
model
for
study
of
PRL
cellular
control
mechanisms
.

Triamterene

nephrolithiasis
complicating
dyazide
therapy
.

A
case
of
triamterene
nephrolithiasis
is
reported
in
a
man
after
4
years
of
hydrochlorothiazide
-
triamterene
therapy
for
hypertension
.

The
stone
passed
spontaneously
and
was
found
to
contain
a
triamterene
metabolite
admixed
with
uric
acid
salts
.

Factors
affecting
triamterene
nephrolithiasis
are
discussed
and
2
previously
reported
cases
are
reviewed
.

Metabolic
involvement
in
adriamycin
cardiotoxicity
.

The
cardiotoxic
effects
of
adriamycin
were
studied
in
mammalian
myocardial
cells
in
culture
as
a
model
system
.

Adriamycin
inhibited
cell
growth
and
the
rhythmic
contractions
characteristic
of
myocardial
cells
in
culture
.

A
possible
involvement
of
energy
metabolism
was
suggested
previously
,
and
in
this
study
the
adenylate
energy
charge
and
phosphorylcreatine
mole
fraction
were
determined
in
the
adriamycin
-treated
cells
.

The
adenylate
energy
charge
was
found
to
be
significantly
decreased
,
while
the
phophorylcreatine
mole
fraction
was
unchanged
.

Such
disparity
suggests
an
inhibition
of
creatine
phosphokinase
.

The
addition
of
1
mM
adenosine
to
the
myocardial
cell
cultures
markedly
increases
the
ATP
concentration
through
a
pathway
reportedly
leading
to
a
compartmentalized
ATP
pool
.

In
the
adriamycin
-treated
cells
,
the
addition
of
adenosine
increased
the
adenylate
charge
and
,
concomitant
with
this
inrcease
,
the
cells
'
functional
integrity
,
in
terms
of
percentage
of
beating
cells
and
rate
of
contractions
,
was
maintained
.

Age
-
dependent
sensitivity
of
the
rat
to
neurotoxic
effects
of
streptomycin
.

Streptomycin
sulfate
(
300
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)
was
injected
for
various
periods
into
preweanling
rats
and
for
3
weeks
into
weanling
rats
.

Beginning
at
8
days
of
age
,
body
movement
and
hearing
were
examined
for
6
and
up
to
17
weeks
,
respectively
.

Abnormal
movements
and
deafness
occurred
only
in
rats
treated
during
the
preweaning
period
;
within
this
period
the
greatest
sensitivities
for
these
abnormalities
occurred
from
2
to
11
-
17
and
5
to
11
days
of
age
,
respectively
,
indicating
that
the
cochlea
is
more
sensitive
to
streptomycin
than
the
site
(
vestibular
or
central
)
responsible
for
the
dyskinesias
.

Crescentic
fibrillary
glomerulonephritis
associated
with
intermittent
rifampin
therapy
for
pulmonary
tuberculosis
.

This
case
study
reveals
an
unusual
finding
of
rapidly
proliferative
crescentic
glomerulonephritis
in
a
patient
treated
with
rifampin
who
had
no
other
identifiable
causes
for
developing
this
disease
.

This
patient
underwent
a
10-month
regimen
of
rifampin
and
isoniazid
for
pulmonary
tuberculosis
and
was
discovered
to
have
developed
signs
of
severe
renal
failure
five
weeks
after
completion
of
therapy
.

Renal
biopsy
revealed
severe
glomerulonephritis
with
crescents
,
electron
dense
fibrillar
deposits
and
moderate
lymphocytic
interstitial
infiltrate
.

Other
possible
causes
of
rapidly
progressive
glomerulonephritis
were
investigated
and
ruled
out
.

This
report
documents
the
unusual
occurrence
of
rapidly
progressive
glomerulonephritis
with
crescents
and
fibrillar

glomerulonephritis
in
a
patient
treated
with
rifampin
.

Time
course
of
lipid
peroxidation
in
puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced
nephropathy
.

Reactive
oxygen
species
have
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
acute
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)
-induced
nephropathy
,
with
antioxidants
significantly
reducing
the
proteinuria
.

The
temporal
relationship
between
lipid
peroxidation
in
the
kidney
and
proteinuria
was
examined
in
this
study
.

Rats
were
treated
with
a
single
IV
injection
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside
,
(
PAN
,
7.5
mg
/
kg
)
and
24
hour
urine
samples
were
obtained
prior
to
sacrifice
on
days
3,5,7,10,17,27,41
(
N
=
5
-
10
per
group
)
.

The
kidneys
were
removed
,
flushed
with
ice
cold
TRIS
buffer
.

Kidney
cortices
from
each
animal
were
used
to
prepare
homogenates
.

Tissue
lipid
peroxidation
was
measured
in
whole
homogenates
as
well
as
in
lipid
extracts
from
homogenates
as
thiobarbituric
acid
reactive
substances
.

Proteinuria
was
evident
at
day
5
,
peaked
at
day
7
and
persisted
to
day
27
.

Lipid
peroxidation
in
homogenates
was
maximal
at
day
3
and
declined
rapidly
to
control
levels
by
day
17
.

This
study
supports
the
role
of
lipid
peroxidation
in
mediating
the
proteinuric
injury
in
PAN
nephropathy
.

Clomipramine
-induced
sleep
disturbance
does
not
impair
its
prolactin
-
releasing
action
.

The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
examine
the
role
of
sleep
disturbance
,
induced
by
clomipramine
administration
,
on
the
secretory
rate
of
prolactin
(
PRL
)
in
addition
to
the
direct
drug
effect
.

Two
groups
of
supine
subjects
were
studied
under
placebo
-
controlled
conditions
,
one
during
the
night
,
when
sleeping
(
n
=
7
)
and
the
other
at
daytime
,
when
awake
(
n
=
6
)
.

Each
subject
received
a
single
50
mg
dose
of
clomipramine
given
orally
2
hours
before
blood
collection
.

Plasma
PRL
concentrations
were
analysed
at
10
min
intervals
and
underlying
secretory
rates
calculated
by
a
deconvolution
procedure
.

For
both
experiments
the
drug
intake
led
to
significant
increases
in
PRL
secretion
,
acting
preferentially
on
tonic
secretion
as
pulse
amplitude
and
frequency
did
not
differ
significantly
from
corresponding
control
values
.

During
the
night
clomipramine
ingestion
altered
the
complete
sleep
architecture
in
that
it
suppressed
REM
sleep
and
the
sleep
cycles
and
induced
increased
wakefulness
.

As
the
relative
increase
in
PRL
secretion
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
the
mean
did
not
significantly
differ
between
the
night
and
day
time
studies
(
46
+
/-
19
%
vs
34
+
/-

10
%
)
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
observed
sleep
disturbance
did
not
interfere
with
the
drug
action
per
se
.

The
presence
of
REM
sleep
was
shown
not
to
be
a
determining
factor
either
for
secretory
pulse
amplitude
and
frequency
,
as
,
for
both
,
mean
nocturnal
values
were
similar
with
and
without
prior
clomipramine
ingestion
.

Angioedema
following
the
intravenous
administration
of
metoprolol
.

A
72-year
-
old
woman
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
with
"
flash
"
pulmonary
edema
,
preceded
by
chest
pain
,
requiring
intubation
.

Her
medical
history
included
coronary
artery
disease
with
previous
myocardial
infarctions
,
hypertension
,
and
diabetes
mellitus
.

A
history
of
angioedema
secondary
to

lisinopril

therapy
was
elicited
.

Current
medications
did
not
include
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
or
beta
-
blockers
.

She
had
no
previous
beta
-
blocking
drug
exposure
.

During
the
first
day
of
hospitalization
(
while
intubated
)
,
intravenous
metoprolol
was
given
,
resulting
in
severe
angioedema
.

The
angioedema
resolved
after
therapy
with
intravenous
steroids
and
diphenhydramine
hydrochloride
.

Effect
of
coniine
on
the
developing
chick
embryo
.

Coniine
,
an
alkaloid
from
Conium
maculatum
(
poison
hemlock
)
,
has
been
shown
to
be
teratogenic
in
livestock
.

The
major
teratogenic
outcome
is
arthrogryposis
,
presumably
due
to
nicotinic
receptor
blockade
.

However
,
coniine
has
failed
to
produce
arthrogryposis
in
rats
or
mice
and
is
only
weakly
teratogenic
in
rabbits
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
and
compare
the
effects
of
coniine
and
nicotine
in
the
developing
chick
.

Concentrations
of
coniine
and
nicotine
sulfate
were
0.015
%
,
0.03
%
,
0.075
%
,
0.15
%
,
0.75
%
,
1.5
%
,
3
%
,
and
6
%
and
1
%
,
5
%
,
and
10
%
,
respectively
.

Both
compounds
caused
deformations
and
lethality
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

All
concentrations
of
nicotine
sulfate
caused
some
lethality
but
a
no
effect
level
for
coniine
lethality
was
0.75
%
.

The
deformations

caused
by
both
coniine
and
nicotine
sulfate
were

excessive
flexion
or
extension
of
one
or
more
toes
.

No
histopathological
alterations
or
differences
in
bone
formation
were
seen
in
the
limbs
or
toes
of
any
chicks
from
any
group
;
however
,
extensive
cranial
hemorrhage
occurred
in
all
nicotine
sulfate
-
treated
chicks
.

There
was
a
statistically
significant
(
P
or
=
0.01
)
decrease
in
movement
in
coniine
and
nicotine
sulfate
treated
chicks
as
determined
by
ultrasound
.

Control
chicks
were
in
motion
an
average
of
33.67
%
of
the
time
,
while
coniine
-treated
chicks
were
only
moving
8.95
%
of
a
5-min
interval
,
and
no
movement
was
observed
for
nicotine
sulfate
treated
chicks
.

In
summary
,
the
chick
embryo
provides
a
reliable
and
simple
experimental
animal
model
of
coniine

-induced

arthrogryposis
.

Data
from
this
model
support
a
mechanism
involving
nicotinic
receptor
blockade
with
subsequent
decreased
fetal
movement
.

Epidural
blood
flow
during
prostaglandin
E1
or
trimethaphan
induced
hypotension
.

To
evaluate
the
effect
of
prostaglandin
E1

(
PGE1
)
or
trimethaphan

(
TMP
)
induced
hypotension
on
epidural
blood
flow
(
EBF
)
during
spinal
surgery
,
EBF
was
measured
using
the
heat
clearance
method
in
30
patients
who
underwent
postero
-
lateral
interbody
fusion
under
isoflurane
anaesthesia
.

An
initial
dose
of
0.1
microgram.kg-1.min-1
of
PGE1

(
15
patients
)
,
or
10
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
of
TMP

(
15
patients
)
was
administered
intravenously
after
the
dural
opening
and
the
dose
was
adjusted
to
maintain
the
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
(
MAP
)
at
about
60
mmHg
.

The
hypotensive
drug
was
discontinued
at
the
completion
of
the
operative
procedure
.

After
starting
PGE1
or
TMP
,
MAP
and
rate
pressure
product
(
RPP
)
decreased
significantly
compared
with
preinfusion
values
(
P
0.01
)
,
and
the
degree
of
hypotension
due
to
PGE1
remained
constant
until
60
min
after
its
discontinuation
.

Heart
rate
(
HR
)
did
not
change
in
either
group
.

EBFF
did
not
change
during
PGE1
infusion
whereas
in
the
TMP
group
,
EBF
decreased
significantly
at
30
and
60
min
after
the
start
of
TMP

(
preinfusion
:
45.9
+
/-

13.9
ml/100g
/
min
.

30
min
:
32.3
+
/-

9.9
ml/100
g
/
min
(
P
0.05
)
.

60
min
:
30
+
/-

7.5
ml/100
g
/
min
(
P
0.05
)
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
PGE1
may
be
preferable
to
TMP
for
hypotensive
anaesthesia
in
spinal
surgery
because
TMP
decreased
EBF
.

Immunohistochemical
studies
with
antibodies
to
neurofilament
proteins
on
axonal
damage
in
experimental
focal
lesions
in
rat
.

Immunohistochemistry
with
monoclonal
antibodies
against
neurofilament
(
NF
)
proteins
of
middle
and
high
molecular
weight
class
,
NF
-
M
and
NF
-
H
,
was
used
to
study
axonal
injury
in
the
borderzone
of
focal
lesions
in
rats
.

Focal
injury
in
the
cortex
was
produced
by
infusion
of
lactate
at
acid
pH
or
by
stab
caused
by
needle
insertion
.

Infarcts
in
substantia
nigra
pars
reticulata
were
evoked
by
prolonged
pilocarpine
-induced
status
epilepticus
.

Immunohistochemical
staining
for
NFs
showed
characteristic
terminal
clubs
of
axons
in
the
borderzone
of
lesions
.

Differences
in
the
labelling
pattern
occurred
with
different
antibodies
which
apparently
depended
on
molecular
weight
class
of
NFs
and
phosphorylation
state
.

These
immunohistochemical
changes
of
NFs
can
serve
as
a
marker
for
axonal
damage
in
various
experimental
traumatic
or
ischemic
lesions
.

Increase
of
Parkinson
disability
after
fluoxetine
medication
.

Depression
is
a
major
clinical
feature
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

We
report
the
increased
amount
of
motor
disability
in
four
patients
with
idiopathic
Parkinson
's
disease

after
exposure
to
the
antidepressant
fluoxetine
.

The
possibility
of
a
clinically
relevant
dopamine
-antagonistic
capacity
of
fluoxetine
in
Parkinson
's
disease
patients
must
be
considered
.

Acetaminophen
-induced
hypotension
.

Through
30
years
of
widespread
use
,
acetaminophen
has
been
shown
to
be
a
remarkably
safe
medication
in
therapeutic
dosages
.

The
potential
for
acetaminophen
to
produce
cardiovascular
toxicities
is
very
low
.

However
,
acetaminophen
has
been
demonstrated
to
produce
symptoms
of
anaphylaxis
,
including
hypotension
,
in
sensitive
individuals
.

This
article
describes
two
critically
ill
patients
in
whom
transient
episodes
of
hypotension
reproducibly
developed
after
administration
of
acetaminophen
.

Other
symptoms
of
allergic
reactions
were
not
clinically
detectable
.

The
hypotensive
episodes
were
severe
enough
to
require
vasopressor
administration
.

The
reports
illustrate
the
need
for
clinicians
to
consider
acetaminophen
in
patients
with
hypotension
of
unknown
origin
.

Acute
hepatitis
,
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
,
and
erythroblastocytopenia
induced
by
ceftriaxone
.

An
80-yr
-
old
man
developed
acute
hepatitis
shortly
after
ingesting
oral
ceftriaxone
.

Although
the
transaminases
gradually
returned
to
baseline
after
withholding
the
beta
lactam
antibiotic
,
there
was
a
gradual
increase
in
serum
bilirubin
and
a
decrease
in
hemoglobin
concentration
caused
by
an
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
and
erythroblastocytopenia
.

These
responded
to
systemic
steroids
and
immunoglobulins
.

Despite
the
widespread
use
of
these
agents
this
triad
of
side
effects
has
not
previously
been
reported
in
connection
with
beta
lactam
antibiotics
.

Adverse
effects
of
the
atypical
antipsychotics
.

Collaborative
Working
Group
on
Clinical
Trial
Evaluations
.

Adverse
effects
of
antipsychotics
often
lead
to
noncompliance
.

Thus
,
clinicians
should
address
patients
'
concerns
about
adverse
effects
and
attempt
to
choose
medications
that
will
improve
their
patients
'
quality
of
life
as
well
as
overall
health
.

The
side
effect
profiles
of
the
atypical
antipsychotics
are
more
advantageous
than
those
of
the
conventional
neuroleptics
.

Conventional
agents
are
associated
with
unwanted
central
nervous
system
effects
,
including
extrapyramidal
symptoms

(
EPS
)
,
tardive
dyskinesia
,
sedation
,
and
possible
impairment
of
some
cognitive
measures
,
as
well
as
cardiac
effects
,
orthostatic
hypotension
,
hepatic
changes
,
anticholinergic
side
effects
,
sexual
dysfunction
,
and
weight
gain
.

The
newer
atypical
agents
have
a
lower
risk
of
EPS
,
but
are
associated
in
varying
degrees
with
sedation
,
cardiovascular
effects
,
anticholinergic
effects
,
weight
gain
,
sexual
dysfunction
,
hepatic
effects
,
lowered
seizure
threshold
(
primarily
clozapine
)
,
and
agranulocytosis

(
clozapine
only
)
.

Since
the
incidence
and
severity
of
specific
adverse
effects
differ
among
the
various
atypicals
,
the
clinician
should
carefully
consider
which
side
effects
are
most
likely
to
lead
to
the
individual
's
dissatisfaction
and
noncompliance
before
choosing
an
antipsychotic
for
a
particular
patient
.

Effects
of
tetrandrine
and
fangchinoline
on
experimental
thrombosis
in
mice
and
human
platelet
aggregation
.

Tetrandrine

(
TET
)
and
fangchinoline

(
FAN
)
are
two
naturally
occurring
analogues
with
a
bisbenzylisoquinoline
structure
.

The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
investigate
the
effects
of
TET
and
FAN
on
the
experimental
thrombosis
induced
by
collagen
plus
epinephrine

(
EP
)
in
mice
,
and
platelet
aggregation
and
blood
coagulation
in
vitro
.

In
the
in
vivo
study
,
the
administration
(
50
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
of
TET
and
FAN
in
mice
showed
the
inhibition
of
thrombosis
by
55
%
and
35
%
,
respectively
,
while
acetylsalicylic
acid

(
ASA
,
50
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
,
a
positive
control
,
showed
only
30
%
inhibition
.

In
the
vitro
human
platelet
aggregations
induced
by
the
agonists
used
in
tests
,
TET
and
FAN
showed
the
inhibitions
dose
dependently
.

In
addition
,
neither
TET
nor
FAN
showed
any
anticoagulation
activities
in
the
measurement
of
the
activated
partial
thromboplastin
time
(
APTT
)
,
prothrombin
time
(
PT
)
and
thrombin
time
(
TT
)
using
human
-
citrated
plasma
.

These
results
suggest
that
antithrombosis
of
TET
and
FAN
in
mice
may
be
mainly
related
to
the
antiplatelet
aggregation
activities
.

Gemcitabine
plus
vinorelbine
in
nonsmall

lung
carcinoma
patients
age
70
years
or
older
or
patients
who
can
not
receive
cisplatin
.

Oncopaz
Cooperative
Group
.

BACKGROUND
:

Although
the
prevalence
of
nonsmall
cell
lung
carcinoma

(
NSCLC
)
is
high
among
elderly
patients
,
few
data
are
available
regarding
the
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
chemotherapy
in
this
group
of
patients
.

Recent
reports
indicate
that
single
agent
therapy
with
vinorelbine

(
VNB
)
or
gemcitabine

(
GEM
)
may
obtain
a
response
rate
of
20
-
30
%
in
elderly
patients
,
with
acceptable
toxicity
and
improvement
in
symptoms
and
quality
of
life
.

In
the
current
study
the
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
the
combination
of
GEM
and
VNB
in
elderly
patients
with
advanced
NSCLC
or
those
with
some
contraindication
to
receiving
cisplatin
were
assessed
.

METHODS
:
Forty
-
nine
patients
with
advanced
NSCLC
were
included
,
38
of
whom
were
age
>
/=
70
years
and
11
were
age
70
years
but
who
had
some
contraindication
to
receiving
cisplatin
.

All
patients
were
evaluable
for
response
and
toxicity
.

Treatment
was
comprised
of
VNB
,
25
mg
/
m(2
)
,
plus
GEM
,
1000
mg
/
m(2
)
,
both
on
Days
1
,
8
,
and
15
every
28
days
.

Patients
received
a
minimum
of
three
courses
unless
progressive
disease
was
detected
.

RESULTS
:

One
hundred
sixty
-
five
courses
were
administered
,
with
a
median
of
3
.

6
courses
per
patient
.

The
overall
response
rate
was
26
%
(
95
%
confidence
interval
,
15
-
41
%
)
.

Two
patients
attained
a
complete
response
(
4
%
)
and
11
patients
(
22
%
)
achieved
a
partial
response
.

Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
performance
status
improved
in
35
%
of
those
patients
with
an
initial
value
>
0
,
whereas
relief
of
at
least
1
symptom
without
worsening
of
other
symptoms
was
noted
in
27
patients
(
55
%
)
.

The
median
time
to
progression
was
16
weeks
and
the
1-year
survival
rate
was
33
%
.

Toxicity
was
mild
.

Six
patients
(
12
%
)
had
World
Health
Organization
Grade
3
-
4
neutropenia
,
2
patients
(
4
%
)
had
Grade
3
-
4
thrombocytopenia
,
and
2
patients
(
4
%
)

had
Grade
3
neurotoxicity
.

Three
patients
with
severe
neutropenia
(
6
%
)
died
of
sepsis
.

The
median
age
of
those
patients
developing
Grade
3
-
4
neutropenia
was
significantly
higher
than
that
of
the
remaining
patients
(
75
years
vs.
72
years
;
P
=
0.047
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
combination
of
GEM
and
VNB
is
moderately
active
and
well
tolerated
except
in
patients
age
>
/=
75
years
.

This
age
group
had
an
increased
risk
of
myelosuppression
.

Therefore
the
prophylactic
use
of
granulocyte
-
colony
stimulating
factor
should
be
considered
with
this
treatment
.

New
chemotherapy
combinations
with
higher
activity
and
lower
toxicity
are
needed
for
elderly
patients
with
advanced
NSCLC
.

Warfarin
-induced

artery
calcification
is
accelerated
by
growth
and
vitamin
D
.

The
present
studies
demonstrate
that
growth
and
vitamin
D
treatment
enhance
the
extent
of
artery
calcification
in
rats
given
sufficient
doses
of
Warfarin
to
inhibit
gamma
-
carboxylation
of
matrix
Gla
protein
,
a
calcification
inhibitor
known
to
be
expressed
by
smooth
muscle
cells
and
macrophages
in
the
artery
wall
.

The
first
series
of
experiments
examined
the
influence
of
age
and
growth
status
on
artery
calcification
in
Warfarin
-treated
rats
.

Treatment
for
2
weeks
with

Warfarin
caused
massive
focal
calcification
of
the
artery
media
in
20-day
-
old
rats
and
less
extensive
focal
calcification
in
42-day
-
old
rats
.

In
contrast
,
no
artery
calcification
could
be
detected
in
10-month
-
old
adult
rats
even
after
4
weeks
of
Warfarin
treatment
.

To
directly
examine
the
importance
of
growth
to
Warfarin
-induced
artery
calcification
in
animals
of
the
same
age
,
20-day
-
old
rats
were
fed
for
2
weeks
either
an
ad
libitum
diet
or
a
6-g
/
d
restricted
diet
that
maintains
weight
but
prevents
growth
.

Concurrent
treatment
of
both
dietary
groups
with
Warfarin
produced
massive
focal
calcification
of
the
artery
media
in
the
ad
libitum
-
fed
rats
but
no
detectable
artery
calcification
in
the
restricted
-
diet
,
growth
-
inhibited
group
.

Although
the
explanation
for
the
association
between
artery
calcification
and
growth
status
can
not
be
determined
from
the
present
study
,
there
was
a
relationship
between
higher
serum
phosphate
and
susceptibility
to
artery
calcification
,
with
30
%
higher
levels
of
serum
phosphate
in
young
,
ad
libitum
-
fed
rats
compared
with
either
of
the
groups
that
was
resistant
to
Warfarin

-induced

artery
calcification
,
ie
,
the
10-month
-
old
rats
and
the
restricted
-
diet
,
growth
-
inhibited
young
rats
.

This
observation
suggests
that
increased
susceptibility
to
Warfarin

-induced

artery
calcification
could
be
related
to
higher
serum
phosphate
levels
.

The
second
set
of
experiments
examined
the
possible
synergy
between
vitamin
D
and
Warfarin
in
artery
calcification
.

High
doses
of

vitamin
D
are
known
to
cause
calcification
of
the
artery
media
in
as
little
as
3
to
4
days
.

High
doses
of
the
vitamin
K
antagonist
Warfarin
are
also
known
to
cause
calcification
of
the
artery
media
,
but
at
treatment
times
of
2
weeks
or
longer
yet
not
at
1
week
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
investigated
the
synergy
between
these
2
treatments
and
found
that
concurrent
Warfarin
administration
dramatically
increased
the
extent
of
calcification
in
the
media
of
vitamin
D

-treated
rats
at
3
and
4
days
.

There
was
a
close
parallel
between
the
effect
of
vitamin
D
dose
on
artery
calcification
and
the
effect
of
vitamin
D
dose
on
the
elevation
of
serum
calcium
,
which
suggests
that
vitamin
D
may
induce
artery
calcification
through
its
effect
on
serum
calcium
.

Because
Warfarin
treatment
had
no
effect
on
the
elevation
in
serum
calcium
produced
by
vitamin
D
,
the
synergy
between
Warfarin
and
vitamin
D
is
probably
best
explained
by
the
hypothesis
that
Warfarin
inhibits
the
activity
of
matrix
Gla
protein
as
a
calcification
inhibitor
.

High
levels
of
matrix
Gla
protein
are
found
at
sites
of
artery
calcification
in
rats
treated
with
vitamin
D
plus
Warfarin
,
and
chemical
analysis
showed
that
the
protein
that
accumulated
was
indeed
not
gamma
-
carboxylated
.

These
observations
indicate
that
although
the
gamma
-
carboxyglutamate
residues
of
matrix
Gla
protein
are
apparently
required
for
its
function
as
a
calcification
inhibitor
,
they
are
not
required
for
its
accumulation
at
calcification
sites
.

Antidepressant
-induced
mania
in
bipolar
patients
:
identification
of
risk
factors
.

BACKGROUND
:

Concerns
about
possible
risks
of
switching
to
mania
associated
with
antidepressants
continue
to
interfere
with
the
establishment
of
an
optimal
treatment
paradigm
for
bipolar
depression
.

METHOD
:

The
response
of
44
patients
meeting
DSM
-
IV
criteria
for
bipolar
disorder
to
naturalistic
treatment
was
assessed
for
at
least
6
weeks
using
the
Montgomery
-
Asberg
Depression
Rating
Scale
and
the
Bech
-
Rafaelson
Mania
Rating
Scale
.

Patients
who
experienced
a
manic
or
hypomanic
switch
were
compared
with
those
who
did
not
on
several
variables
including
age
,
sex
,
diagnosis
(
DSM
-
IV
bipolar
I
vs.
bipolar
II
)
,
number
of
previous
manic
episodes
,
type
of
antidepressant
therapy
used
(
electroconvulsive
therapy
vs.
antidepressant
drugs
and
,
more
particularly
,
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors

[
SSRIs
]
)
,
use
and
type
of
mood
stabilizers
(
lithium
vs.
anticonvulsants
)
,
and
temperament
of
the
patient
,
assessed
during
a
normothymic
period
using
the
hyperthymia
component
of
the
Semi
-
structured
Affective
Temperament
Interview
.

RESULTS
:

Switches
to
hypomania
or
mania
occurred
in
27
%
of
all
patients
(
N
=
12
)
(
and
in
24
%
of
the
subgroup
of
patients
treated
with
SSRIs

[
8/33
]
)
;
16
%
(
N
=
7
)
experienced
manic
episodes
,
and
11
%
(
N
=
5
)
experienced
hypomanic
episodes
.

Sex
,
age
,
diagnosis
(
bipolar
I
vs.
bipolar
II
)
,
and
additional
treatment
did
not
affect
the
risk
of
switching
.

The
incidence
of
mood
switches
seemed
not
to
differ
between
patients
receiving
an
anticonvulsant
and
those
receiving
no
mood
stabilizer
.

In
contrast
,
mood
switches
were
less
frequent
in
patients
receiving
lithium

(
15
%
,
4/26
)
than
in
patients
not
treated
with
lithium

(
44
%
,
8/18
;
p
=
.04
)
.

The
number
of
previous
manic
episodes
did
not
affect
the
probability
of
switching
,
whereas
a
high
score
on
the
hyperthymia
component
of
the
Semistructured
Affective
Temperament
Interview
was
associated
with
a
greater
risk
of
switching
(
p
=
.008
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
frequency
of
mood
switching
associated
with
acute
antidepressant
therapy
may
be
reduced
by
lithium
treatment
.

Particular
attention
should
be
paid
to
patients
with
a
hyperthymic
temperament
,
who
have
a
greater
risk
of
mood
switches
.

Caffeine

Bladder
retention
of
urine
as
a
result
of
continuous
intravenous
infusion
of
fentanyl
:
2
case
reports
.

Sedation
has
been
commonly
used
in
the
neonate
to
decrease
the
stress
and
pain
from
the
noxious
stimuli
and
invasive
procedures
in
the
neonatal
intensive

unit
,
as
well
as
to
facilitate
synchrony
between

,
is
frequently
used
in
the
neonatal

for
these
very
purposes
.

Various
reported

Combined
antiretroviral
therapy
causes

cardiomyopathy
and
elevates
plasma
lactate
in
transgenic
AIDS
mice
.

Highly
active
antiretroviral
therapy
(
HAART
)
is
implicated
in
cardiomyopathy

(
CM
)
and
in
elevated
plasma
lactate

(
LA
)
in
AIDS
through
mechanisms
of
mitochondrial
dysfunction
.

To
determine
mitochondrial
events
from
HAART
in
vivo
,
8-week
-
old
hemizygous
transgenic
AIDS
mice
(
NL4
-
3Delta
gag
/

TG
)
and
wild

n
littermates
were
treated
with
the
HAART
combination
of
zidovudine
,
lamivudine
,
and
indinavir
or
vehicle
control
for
10
days
or
35
days
.

At
termination
of
the
experiments
,
mice
underwent
echocardiography
,
quantitation
of
abundance
of
molecular
markers
of
CM

(
ventricular
mRNA
encoding
atrial
natriuretic
factor
[
ANF
]
and
sarcoplasmic
calcium
ATPase
[
SERCA2
]
)
,
and
determination
of
plasma
LA
.

Myocardial
histologic
features
were
analyzed
semiquantitatively
and
results
were
confirmed
by
transmission
electron
microscopy
.

After
35
days
in
the
TG
+
HAART
cohort
,
left
ventricular
mass
increased
160
%
by
echocardiography
.

Molecularly
,
ANF
mRNA
increased
250
%
and
SERCA2
mRNA
decreased
57
%
.

Biochemically
,
LA
was
elevated
(
8.5
+
/-

2.0
mM
)
.

Pathologically
,
granular
cytoplasmic
changes
were
found
in
cardiac
myocytes
,
indicating
enlarged
,
damaged
mitochondria
.

Findings
were
confirmed
ultrastructurally
.

No
changes
were
found
in
other
cohorts
.

After
10
days
,
only
ANF
was
elevated
,
and
only
in
the
TG
+
HAART
cohort
.

Results
show
that
cumulative
HAART
caused
mitochondrial

Oral
contraceptives
and
the
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
.

BACKGROUND
:

An
association
between
the
use
of
oral
contraceptives
and
the
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
has
been
found
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
studies
.

We
investigated
this
association
,
according
to
the
type
of
progestagen
included
in
third
-
generation
(
i.e.
,
desogestrel
or
gestodene
)
and
second
-
generation
(
i.e.
,
levonorgestrel
)
oral
contraceptives
,
the
dose
of
estrogen
,
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
prothrombotic
mutations
METHODS
:

In
a
nationwide
,
population
-
based
,
case
-
control
study
,
we
identified
and
enrolled
248
women
18
through
49
years
of
age
who
had
had
a
first
myocardial
infarction
between
1990
and
1995
and
925
control
women
who
had
not
had
a
myocardial
infarction
and
who
were
matched
for
age
,
calendar
year
of
the
index
event
,
and
area
of
residence
.

Subjects
supplied
information
on
oral
-
contraceptive
use
and
major
cardiovascular
risk
factors
.

An
analysis
for
factor
V
Leiden
and
the
G20210A
mutation
in
the
prothrombin
gene
was
conducted
in
217
patients
and
763
controls
RESULTS
:

The
odds
ratio
for
myocardial
infarction
among
women
who
used
any
type
of
combined
oral
contraceptive
,
as
compared
with
nonusers
,
was
2.0
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
1.5
to
2.8
)
.

The
adjusted
odds
ratio
was
2.5
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
1.5
to
4.1
)
among
women
who
used
second
-
generation
oral
contraceptives
and
1.3
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
0.7
to
2.5
)
among
those
who
used
third
-
generation
oral
contraceptives
.

Among
women
who
used
oral
contraceptives
,
the
odds
ratio
was
2.1
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
1.5
to
3.0
)
for
those
without
a
prothrombotic
mutation
and
1.9
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
0.6
to
5.5
)
for
those
with
a
mutation
CONCLUSIONS
:

The
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
was
increased
among
women
who
used
second
-
generation
oral
contraceptives
.

The
results
with
respect
to
the
use
of
third
-
generation
oral
contraceptives
were
inconclusive
but
suggested
that
the
risk
was
lower
than
the
risk
associated
with
second
-
generation
oral
contraceptives
.

The
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
was
similar
among
women
who
used
oral
contraceptives

whether
or
not
they
had
a
prothrombotic
mutation
.

Effects
of
5-HT1B
receptor
ligands
microinjected
into
the
accumbal
shell
or
core
on
the
cocaine
-induced

locomotor
hyperactivity
in
rats
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
examine
the
effect
of
5-HT1B
receptor
ligands
microinjected
into
the
subregions
of
the
nucleus
accumbens
(
the
shell
and
the
core
)
on
the
locomotor
hyperactivity
induced
by
cocaine
in
rats
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
implanted
bilaterally
with
cannulae
into
the
accumbens
shell
or
core
,
and
then
were
locally
injected
with
GR
55562

(
an
antagonist
of
5-HT1B
receptors
)
or
CP
93129
(
an
agonist
of
5-HT1B
receptors
)
.

Given
alone
to
any
accumbal
subregion
,
GR
55562
(
0.1
-
10
microg
/
side
)
or
CP
93129
(
0.1
-
10
microg
/
side
)
did
not
change
basal
locomotor
activity
.

Systemic
cocaine

(
10
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
increased
the
locomotor
activity
of
rats
.

GR
55562
(
0.1
-
10
microg
/
side
)
,
administered
intra
-
accumbens
shell
prior
to

cocaine
,
dose
-
dependently
attenuated
the
psychostimulant
-
induced
locomotor
hyperactivity
.

Such
attenuation
was
not
found
in
animals
which
had
been
injected
with
GR
55562
into
the
accumbens
core
.

When
injected
into
the
accumbens
shell
(
but
not
the
core
)
before
cocaine
,
CP
93129
(
0.1
-
10
microg
/
side
)
enhanced
the
locomotor
response
to
cocaine
;
the
maximum
effect
being
observed
after
10
microg
/
side
of
the
agonist
.

The
later
enhancement
was
attenuated
after
intra
-
accumbens
shell
treatment
with
GR
55562

(
1
microg
/
side
)
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
cocaine
induced
hyperlocomotion
is
modified
by
5-HT1B
receptor
ligands
microinjected
into
the
accumbens
shell
,
but
not
core
,
this
modification
consisting
in
inhibitory
and
facilitatory
effects
of
the
5-HT1B
receptor
antagonist
(
GR
55562
)
and
agonist
(
CP
93129
)
,
respectively
.

In
other
words
,
the
present
results
suggest
that
the
accumbal
shell
5-HT1B
receptors
play
a
permissive
role
in
the
behavioural
response
to
the
psychostimulant
.

Ticlopidine
-induced
cholestatic
hepatitis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
2
cases
of
ticlopidine
-induced
cholestatic
hepatitis
,
investigate
its
mechanism
,
and
compare
the
observed
main
characteristics
with
those
of
the
published
cases
.

CASE
SUMMARIES
:

Two
patients
developed
prolonged
cholestatic
hepatitis
after
receiving
ticlopidine
following
percutaneous
coronary
angioplasty
,
with
complete
remission
during
the
follow
-
up
period
.

T
-
cell
stimulation
by
therapeutic
concentration
of
ticlopidine
was
demonstrated
in
vitro
in
the
patients
,
but
not
in
healthy
controls
.

DISCUSSION

:
Cholestatic
hepatitis
is
a
rare
complication
of
the
antiplatelet
agent
ticlopidine
;
several
cases
have
been
reported
but
few
in
the
English
literature
.

Our
patients
developed

jaundice
following
treatment
with
ticlopidine
and
showed
the
clinical
and
laboratory
characteristics
of
cholestatic
hepatitis
,
which
resolved
after
discontinuation
of
the
drug
.

Hepatitis
may
develop
weeks
after
discontinuation
of
the
drug
and
may
run
a
prolonged
course
,
but
complete
remission
was
observed
in
all
reported
cases
.

An
objective
causality
assessment
revealed
that
the
adverse
drug
event
was
probably
related
to
the
use
of
ticlopidine
.

The
mechanisms
of
this
ticlopidine
-induced
cholestasis
are
unclear
.

Immune
mechanisms
may
be
involved
in
the
drug
's
hepatotoxicity
,
as
suggested
by
the
T
-
cell
stimulation
study
reported
here
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Cholestatic
hepatitis
is
a
rare
adverse
effect
of
ticlopidine
that
may
be
immune
mediated
.

Patients
receiving
the
drug
should
be
monitored
with
liver
function
tests
along
with
complete
blood
cell
counts
.

This
complication
will
be
observed
even
less
often
in
the
future
as
ticlopidine
is
being
replaced
by
the
newer
antiplatelet
agent
clopidogrel
.

Epithelial
sodium
channel
(
ENaC
)
subunit
mRNA
and
protein
expression
in
rats
with

puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced

nephrotic
syndrome
.

In
experimental
nephrotic
syndrome
,
urinary
sodium
excretion
is
decreased
during
the
early
phase
of
the
disease
.

The
molecular
mechanism(s
)
leading
to
salt
retention
has
not
been
completely
elucidated
.

The
rate
-
limiting
constituent
of
collecting
duct
sodium
transport
is
the
epithelial
sodium
channel
(
ENaC
)
.

We
examined
the
abundance
of
ENaC
subunit
mRNAs
and
proteins
in
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)
-induced
nephrotic
syndrome
.

The
time
courses
of
urinary
sodium
excretion
,
plasma
aldosterone
concentration
and
proteinuria
were
studied
in
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
treated
with
a
single
dose
of
either
PAN
or
vehicle
.

The
relative
amounts
of
alphaENaC
,
betaENaC
and
gammaENaC
mRNAs
were
determined
in
kidneys
from
these
rats
by
real
-
time
quantitative
TaqMan
PCR
,
and
the
amounts
of
proteins
by
Western
blot
.

The
kinetics
of
urinary
sodium
excretion
and
the
appearance
of
proteinuria
were
comparable
with
those
reported
previously
.

Sodium
retention
occurred
on
days
2
,
3
and
6
after
PAN
injection
.

A
significant
up
-
regulation
of
alphaENaC
and
betaENaC
mRNA
abundance
on
days
1
and
2
preceded
sodium
retention
on
days
2
and
3
.

Conversely
,
down
-
regulation
of
alphaENaC
,
betaENaC
and
gammaENaC
mRNA
expression
on
day
3
occurred
in
the
presence
of
high
aldosterone
concentrations
,
and
was
followed
by
a
return
of
sodium
excretion
to
control
values
.

The
amounts
of
alphaENaC
,
betaENaC
and
gammaENaC
proteins
were
not
increased
during
PAN

-induced

sodium
retention
.

In
conclusion
,
ENaC
mRNA
expression
,
especially
alphaENaC
,
is
increased
in
the
very
early
phase
of
the
experimental
model
of
PAN
-induced
nephrotic
syndrome
in
rats
,
but
appears
to
escape
from
the
regulation
by
aldosterone
after
day
3
.

NO

:
strong
increase
in
plasma
calcitonin
gene
-
related
peptide

(
CGRP
)
concentration
and
negative
correlation
with
platelet
serotonin
release
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
changes
in
the
plasma
calcitonin
gene
-
related
peptide

(
CGRP
)
concentration
and
platelet

(
5-hydroxytriptamine
,
5-HT
)
content
during
the
immediate

and
the
delayed
genuine

attack
provoked
by
nitroglycerin
.

Fifteen
female
migraineurs
(
without
aura
)
and
eight
controls
participated
in
the
study
.

Sublingual
nitroglycerin

(
0.5
mg
)
was
administered
.

Blood
was
collected
from
the
antecubital
vein
four
times
:
60
min
before
and
after
the
nitroglycerin
application
,
and
60
and
120
min
after
the
beginning
of
the
migraine
attack
(
mean
344
and
404
min
;
12
subjects
)
.

In
those
subjects
who
had
no
migraine
attack
(
11
subjects
)
a
similar
time
schedule
was
used
.

Plasma
CGRP
concentration
increased
significantly
(
P<0.01
)
during
the
migraine
attack
and
returned
to
baseline
after
the
cessation
of
the
migraine
.

In
addition
,
both
change
and
peak
,
showed
significant
positive
correlations
with
migraine
headache
intensity
(
P<0.001
)
.

However
,
plasma
CGRP
concentrations
failed
to
change
during
immediate
headache
and
in
the
subjects
with
no
migraine
attack
.

Basal
CGRP

concentration
was
significantly
higher
and
platelet
5-HT
content
tended
to
be
lower
in
subjects
who
experienced
a
migraine
attack
.

Platelet
serotonin
content
decreased
significantly
(
P<0.01
)
after
nitroglycerin
in
subjects
with
no
migraine
attack
but
no
consistent
change
was
observed
in
patients
with
migraine
attack
.

In
conclusion
,
the
fact
that
plasma
CGRP
concentration
correlates
with
the
timing
and
severity
of
a
migraine
headache
suggests
a
direct
relationship
between
CGRP
and
migraine
.

In
contrast
,
serotonin
release
from
platelets
does
not
provoke
migraine
,
it
may
even
counteract
the
headache
and
the
concomitant
CGRP
release
in
this
model
.

Coronary
aneurysm
after
implantation
of
a
paclitaxel
-eluting
stent
.

Formation
of
coronary
aneurysm
is
a
rare
complication
of
stenting
with
bare
metal
stents
,
but
based
on
experimental
studies
drug
-
eluting
stents
may
induce
toxic
effects
on
the
vessel
wall
with
incomplete
stent
apposition
,
aneurysm
formation
and
with
the
potential
of
stent
thrombosis
or
vessel
rupture
.

We
present
a
43-year
-
old
man
who
developed
a
coronary
aneurysm
in
the
right
coronary
artery
6
months
after
receiving
a
paclitaxel
-eluting
stent
.

The
patient
was
asymptomatic
and
the
aneurysm
was
detected
in
a
routine
control
.

Angiography
and
intracoronary
ultrasound
demonstrated
lack
of
contact
between
stent
and
vessel
wall
in
a
15-mm
long
segment
with
maximal
aneurysm
diameter
of
6.0
mm
.

The
patient
was
successfully
treated
with
a
graft
stent
.

Behavioral
effects
of
urotensin
-
II
centrally
administered
in
mice
.

Urotensin
-
II
(
U
-
II
)
receptors
are
widely
distributed
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

Intracerebroventricular
(
i.c.v
.
)
injection
of
U
-
II
causes

hypertension
and
bradycardia
and
stimulates
prolactin
and
thyrotropin
secretion
.

However
,
the
behavioral
effects
of
centrally
administered
U
-
II
have
received
little
attention
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
tested
the
effects
of
i.c.v
.
injections
of
U
-
II
on
behavioral
,
metabolic
,
and
endocrine
responses
in
mice
.

Administration
of
graded
doses
of
U
-
II

(
1
-
10,000
ng
/
mouse
)
provoked
:
(
1
)
a
dose
-
dependent
reduction
in
the
number
of
head
dips
in
the
hole
-
board
test
;
(
2
)
a
dose
-
dependent
reduction
in
the
number
of
entries
in
the
white
chamber
in
the
black
-
and
-
white
compartment
test
,
and
in
the
number
of
entries
in
the
central
platform
and
open
arms
in
the
plus
-
maze
test
;
and
(
3
)
a
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
the
duration
of
immobility
in
the
forced
-
swimming
test
and
tail
suspension
test
.

Intracerebroventricular
injection
of
U
-
II
also
caused
an
increase
in
:
food
intake
at
doses
of
100
and
1,000
ng
/
mouse
,
water
intake
at
doses
of
100
-
10,000
ng
/
mouse
,
and
horizontal
locomotion
activity
at
a
dose
of
10,000
ng
/
mouse
.

Whatever
was
the
dose
,
the
central
administration
of
U
-
II
had
no
effect
on
body
temperature
,
nociception
,

apomorphine
-induced

penile
erection
and
climbing
behavior
,
and
stress
-
induced
plasma

corticosterone
level
.

Taken
together
,
the
present
study
demonstrates
that
the
central
injection
of
U
-
II
at
doses
of
1
-
10,000
ng
/
mouse
induces
anxiogenic-
and
depressant
-
like
effects
in
mouse
.

These
data
suggest
that
U
-
II
may
be
involved
in
some
aspects
of
psychiatric
disorders
.

Recurrent
dysphonia
and
acitretin
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
woman
complaining
of
dysphonia
while
she
was
treated
by
acitretin
.

Her
symptoms
totally
regressed
after
drug
withdrawal
and
reappeared
when
acitretin
was
reintroduced
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
case
of
acitretin
-induced
dysphonia
.

This
effect
may
be
related
to
the
pharmacological
effect
of
this
drug
on
mucous
membranes
.

Pharmacological
modulation
of
pain
-related
brain
activity
during
normal
and
central
sensitization
states
in
humans
.

Abnormal
processing
of
somatosensory
inputs
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
central
sensitization
)
is
the
mechanism
accounting
for
the
enhanced
pain
sensitivity
in
the
skin
surrounding
tissue
injury

(
secondary
hyperalgesia
)
.

Secondary
hyperalgesia
shares
clinical
characteristics
with

neurogenic
hyperalgesia
in
patients
with
neuropathic
pain
.

Abnormal
brain
responses
to
somatosensory
stimuli
have
been
found
in
patients
with
hyperalgesia
as
well
as
in
normal
subjects
during
experimental
central
sensitization
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
gabapentin
,
a
drug
effective
in
neuropathic
pain
patients
,
on
brain
processing
of
nociceptive
information
in
normal
and
central
sensitization
states
.

Using
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
fMRI
)
in
normal
volunteers
,
we
studied
the
gabapentin
-induced
modulation
of
brain
activity
in
response
to
nociceptive
mechanical
stimulation
of
normal
skin
and
capsaicin
-induced
secondary
hyperalgesia
.

The
dose
of
gabapentin
was
1,800
mg
per
os
,
in
a
single
administration
.

We
found
that
(
i
)
gabapentin
reduced
the
activations
in
the
bilateral
operculoinsular
cortex
,
independently
of
the
presence
of
central
sensitization
;
(
ii
)
gabapentin
reduced
the
activation
in
the
brainstem
,
only
during
central
sensitization
;
(
iii
)

gabapentin
suppressed
stimulus
-
induced
deactivations
,
only
during
central
sensitization
;
this
effect
was
more
robust
than
the
effect
on
brain
activation
.

The
observed
drug
-
induced
effects
were
not
due
to
changes
in
the
baseline
fMRI
signal
.

These
findings
indicate
that
gabapentin
has
a
measurable
antinociceptive
effect
and
a
stronger
antihyperalgesic
effect
most
evident
in
the
brain
areas
undergoing
deactivation
,
thus
supporting
the
concept
that
gabapentin
is
more
effective
in
modulating
nociceptive
transmission
when
central
sensitization
is
present
.

MDMA
polydrug
users
show
process
-
specific
central
executive
impairments
coupled
with
impaired
social
and
emotional
judgement
processes
.

In
recent
years
working
memory
deficits
have
been
reported
in
users
of
MDMA

(
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
,
ecstasy
)
.

The
current
study
aimed
to
assess
the
impact
of
MDMA
use
on
three
separate
central
executive
processes
(
set
shifting
,
inhibition
and
memory
updating
)
and
also
on
"
prefrontal
"
mediated
social
and
emotional
judgement
processes
.

Fifteen
polydrug

ecstasy
users
and
15
polydrug
non-
ecstasy
user
controls
completed
a
general
drug
use
questionnaire
,
the
Brixton
Spatial
Anticipation
task
(
set
shifting
)
,
Backward
Digit
Span
procedure
(
memory
updating
)
,
Inhibition
of
Return
(
inhibition
)
,
an
emotional
intelligence
scale
,
the
Tromso
Social
Intelligence
Scale
and
the
Dysexecutive
Questionnaire
(
DEX
)
.

Compared
with
MDMA
-free
polydrug
controls
,
MDMA
polydrug
users
showed
impairments
in
set
shifting
and
memory
updating
,
and
also
in
social
and
emotional
judgement
processes
.

The
latter
two
deficits
remained
significant
after
controlling
for
other
drug
use
.

These
data
lend
further
support
to
the
proposal
that
cognitive
processes
mediated
by
the
prefrontal
cortex
may
be
impaired
by
recreational
ecstasy
use
.

Severe
citrate
toxicity

complicating
volunteer
apheresis
platelet
donation
.

We
report
a
case
of
severe
citrate
toxicity
during
volunteer
donor
apheresis
platelet
collection
.

The
donor
was
a
40-year
-
old
female
,
first
-
time
apheresis
platelet
donor
.

Past
medical
history
was
remarkable
for
hypertension
,
hyperlipidemia
,
and
depression
.

Reported
medications
included
bumetanide
,
pravastatin
,
and
paroxetine
.

Thirty
minutes
from
the
start
of
the
procedure
,
the
donor
noted
tingling
around
the
mouth
,
hands
,
and
feet
.

She
then
very
rapidly
developed
acute
onset
of
severe
facial
and
extremity
tetany
.

Empirical
treatment
with
intravenous
calcium
gluconate
was
initiated
,
and
muscle
contractions
slowly
subsided
over
approximately
10
to
15
minutes
.

The
events
are
consistent
with
a
severe
reaction
to
calcium
chelation
by
sodium
citrate
anticoagulant
resulting
in
symptomatic
systemic
hypocalcemia
.

Upon
additional
retrospective
analysis
,
it
was
noted
that
bumetanide
is
a
loop
diuretic
that
may
cause
significant
hypocalcemia
.

We
conclude
that
careful
screening
for
medications
and
underlying
conditions
predisposing
to
hypocalcemia
is
recommended
to
help
prevent
severe
reactions
due
to
citrate
toxicity
.

Laboratory
measurement
of
pre
-
procedure
serum
calcium
levels
in
selected
donors
may
identify
cases
requiring
heightened
vigilance
.

The
case
also
illustrates
the
importance
of
maintaining
preparedness
for
managing
rare
but
serious
reactions
in
volunteer
apheresis
blood
donors
.

Proteinuria
after
conversion
to
sirolimus
in
renal
transplant
recipients
.

Sirolimus

(
SRL
)
is
a
new
,
potent
immunosuppressive
agent
.

More
recently
,
proteinuria
has
been
reported
as
a
consequence
of
sirolimus
therapy
,
although
the
mechanism
has
remained
unclear
.

We
retrospectively
examined
the
records
of
25
renal
transplant
patients
,
who
developed
or
displayed
increased

proteinuria
after
SRL
conversion
.

The
patient
cohort
(
14
men
,
11
women
)
was
treated
with
SRL
as
conversion
therapy
,
due
to
chronic
allograft
nephropathy

(
CAN
)
(
n
=
15
)
neoplasia
(
n
=
8)
;
Kaposi

sarcoma
,
Four
skin

,
One
intestinal
tumors
,
One
renal
cell

)
or
BK
virus
nephropathy

(
n
=
2
)
.

SRL
was
started
at
a
mean
of
78
+
/-
42
(
15
to
163
)
months
after
transplantation
.

Mean
follow
-
up
on
SRL

therapy
was
20
+
/-

12
(
6
to
43
)
months
.

Proteinuria
increased
from
0.445
(
0
to
1.5
)

g
/
d
before
conversion
to
3.2
g
/
dL
(
0.2
to
12
)
after
conversion
(
P
=
0.001
)
.

Before
conversion
8
(
32
%
)
patients
had
no
proteinuria
,
whereas
afterwards
all
patients
had
proteinuria
.

In
28
%
of
patients
proteinuria
remained
unchanged
,
whereas
it
increased
in
68
%
of
patients
.

In
40
%
it
increased
by
more
than
100
%
.

Twenty
-
eight
percent
of
patients
showed
increased

proteinuria
to
the
nephrotic
range
.

Biopsies
performed
in
five
patients
revealed
new
pathological
changes
:
One
membranoproliferative
glomerulopathy
and
interstitial
nephritis
.

These
patients
showed
persistently
good
graft
function
.

Serum
creatinine
values
did
not
change
significantly
:
1.98
+
/-
0.8
mg
/
dL
before

SRL
therapy
and
2.53
+
/-

1.9
mg
/
dL
at
last
follow
-
up
(
P
=
.14
)
.

Five
grafts
were
lost
and
the
patients
returned
to
dialysis
.

Five
patients
displayed

CAN
and
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
.

Mean
urinary
protein
of
patients
who
returned
to
dialysis
was
1.26
(
0.5
to
3.5
)

g
/
d
before
and
4.7
(
3
to
12
)

g
/
d
after
conversion
(
P
=
.01
)
.

Mean
serum
creatinine
level
before
conversion

was
2.21
mg
/
dL
and
thereafter
,
4.93
mg
/
dL
(
P
=
.02
)
.

Heavy
proteinuria
was
common
after
the
use
of
SRL
as
rescue
therapy
for
renal
transplantation
.

Therefore
,
conversion
should
be
considered
for
patients
who
have
not
developed
advanced
CAN
and
proteinuria
.

The
possibility
of
de
novo
glomerular
pathology
under
SRL
treatment
requires
further
investigation
by
renal
biopsy
.

In
vitro
characterization
of
parasympathetic
and
sympathetic
responses
in
cyclophosphamide
-induced
cystitis
in
the
rat
.

In

cyclophosphamide
-induced
cystitis
in
the
rat
,
detrusor
function
is
impaired
and
the
expression
and
effects
of
muscarinic
receptors
altered
.

Whether
or
not
the
neuronal
transmission
may
be
affected
by
cystitis
was
presently
investigated
.

Responses
of
urinary
strip
preparations
from
control
and
cyclophosphamide
-pretreated
rats
to
electrical
field
stimulation
and
to
agonists
were
assessed
in
the
absence
and
presence
of
muscarinic
,
adrenergic
and
purinergic
receptor
antagonists
.

Generally
,
atropine
reduced
contractions
,
but
in
contrast
to
controls
,
it
also
reduced
responses
to
low
electrical
field
stimulation
intensity
(
1
-
5
Hz
)
in
inflamed
preparations
.

In
both
types
,
purinoceptor
desensitization
with
alpha
,
beta
-
methylene
adenosine-5'-triphosphate

(
alpha
,
beta
-
meATP
)
caused
further
reductions
at
low
frequencies
(
10
Hz
)
.

The
muscarinic
receptor
antagonists
atropine
,
4-diphenylacetoxy
-
N
-
methylpiperidine

(
4-DAMP
)
(
'
M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective
'
)
,
methoctramine

(
'
M(2)-selective
'
)
and
pirenzepine
(
'
M(1)-selective
'
)
antagonized
the
tonic
component
of
the
electrical
field
stimulation
-
evoked
contractile
response
more
potently
than
the
phasic
component
.

4-DAMP
inhibited
the
tonic
contractions
in
controls
more
potently
than
methoctramine
and
pirenzepine
.

In
inflamed
preparations
,
the
muscarinic
receptor
antagonism
on
the
phasic
component
of
the
electrical
field
stimulation
-
evoked
contraction
was
decreased
and
the
pirenzepine
and
4-DAMP
antagonism
on
the
tonic
component
was
much
less
efficient
than
in
controls
.

In
contrast
to
controls
,
methoctramine
increased
--
instead
of
decreased
--
the
tonic
responses
at
high
frequencies
.

While
contractions
to
carbachol
and
ATP
were
the
same
in
inflamed
and
in
control
strips
when
related
to
a
reference

potassium
response
,
isoprenaline
-induced
relaxations
were
smaller
in
inflamed
strips
.

Thus
,
in
cystitis
substantial
changes
of
the
efferent
functional
responses
occur
.

While
postjunctional
beta
-
adrenoceptor
-
mediated
relaxations
are
reduced
,
effects
by
prejunctional
inhibitory
muscarinic
receptors
may
be
increased
.

Associations

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
associations
between
the
use
of
benzodiazepines
or
related
drugs
(
BZDs
/RDs
)
and
health
,
functional

.

METHODS
:

A
non

randomised
clinical
study
of
patients
aged
>
or
=
65
years
admitted
to
acute
hospital
wards
during
1
month
.

164
patients
(
mean
age
+
/-

standard

6.8
years
)
were
admitted
.

Of
these
,
nearly
half
(
n
=
78
)
had
used
BZDs
/RDs
before
admission
,
and
the
remainder
(
n
=
86
)
were
non

users
.

Cognitive
ability
was
assessed
by
the
Mini

(
MMSE
)
.

Patients
scoring
>

were
interviewed
(
n

)
and
questioned
regarding
symptoms
and

during
the
week
prior
to
admission
.

Data
on
use
of
BZDs

before
admission
,
current

were
collected
from
medical

were
compared
between
BZD

were
made
for

were
analysed
.

RESULTS
:

The
mean
+
/-
SD
duration
of
BZD
/
RD
use
was
7
+
/-

7
years
(
range
1
-
31
)
.

Two
or
three
BZDs
/RDs
were
concomitantly
taken
by
26
%
of
users
(
n
=
20
)
.

Long
-
term
use
of
these
drugs
was
associated
with
female
sex
and
use
of
a
higher
number
of
drugs
with
effects
on
the
CNS
,
which
tended
to
be
related
to
diagnosed
dementia
.

After
adjustment
for
these
variables
as
confounders
,
use
of
BZDs
/RDs
was
not
associated
with
cognitive
function
as
measured
by
the
MMSE
.

However
,
use
of
BZDs
/RDs
was
associated
with
dizziness
,
inability
to
sleep
after
awaking
at
night
and
tiredness
in
the
mornings
during
the
week
prior
to
admission
and
with
stronger
depressive
symptoms
measured
at
the
beginning
of
the
hospital
stay
.

Use
of
BZDs
/RDs
tended
to
be
associated
with
a
reduced
ability
to
walk
and
shorter
night
-
time
sleep
during
the
week
prior
to
admission
.

A
higher
residual
serum
concentration
of
temazepam
correlated
with
a
lower
MMSE
sum
score
after
adjustment
for
confounding
variables
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Long
-
term
use
and
concomitant
use
of
more
than
one
BZD
/
RD
were
common
in
elderly
patients
hospitalised
because
of
acute
illnesses
.

Long
-
term
use
was
associated
with
daytime
and
night
-
time
symptoms
indicative
of
poorer
health
and
potentially
caused
by
the
adverse
effects
of
these
drugs
.

Acute
vocal
fold
palsy
after
acute
disulfiram
intoxication
.

Acute
peripheral
neuropathy
caused
by
a
disulfiram

overdose
is
very
rare
and
there
is
no
report
of
it
leading
to
vocal
fold
palsy
.

A
49-year
-
old
woman
was
transferred
to
our
department
because
of
quadriparesis
,
lancinating
pain
,
sensory
loss
,
and
paresthesia
of
the
distal
limbs
.

One
month
previously
,
she
had
taken
a
single
high
dose
of
disulfiram

(
130
tablets
of
ALCOHOL
STOP
TAB
,
Shin
-
Poong
Pharm
.

Co.
,
Ansan
,
Korea
)
in
a
suicide
attempt
.

She
was
not
an
alcoholic
.

For
the
first
few
days
after
ingestion
,
she
was
in
a
confused
state
and
had
mild
to
moderate
ataxia
and
giddiness
.

She
noticed
hoarseness
and
distally
accentuated
motor
and
sensory
dysfunction
after
she
had
recovered
from
this
state
.

A
nerve
conduction
study
was
consistent
with
severe
sensorimotor
axonal
polyneuropathy
.

Laryngeal
electromyography
(
thyroarytenoid
muscle
)
showed
ample
denervation
potentials
.

Laryngoscopy
revealed
asymmetric
vocal
fold
movements
during
phonation
.

Her
vocal
change
and
weakness
began
to
improve
spontaneously
about
3
weeks
after
transfer
.

This
was
a
case
of
acute
palsy
of
the
recurrent
laryngeal
nerve
and
superimposed
severe
acute
sensorimotor
axonal
polyneuropathy
caused
by
high

intoxication
.

Higher
optical
density
of
an
antigen
assay
predicts

thrombosis
in
patients
with
heparin

-induced

thrombocytopenia
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
correlate
optical
density
and
percent
inhibition
of
a
two
-
step
heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
(
HIT
)
antigen
assay
with

;
the
assay
utilizes
reaction
inhibition
characteristics
of
a
high
heparin
concentration
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

Patients
with
more
than
50
%
decrease
in
platelet
count
or
thrombocytopenia
(
150
x
10(9)/L
)
after
exposure
to
heparin
,
who
had
a
positive
two
-
step
antigen
assay
[
optical
density
(
OD
)
>
0.4
and
>
50
inhibition
with
high
concentration
of
heparin
]
were
included
in
the
study
.

RESULTS
:

Forty
of
94

HIT
patients
had
thrombosis
at
diagnosis
;
54/94
had
isolated-
HIT
without
thrombosis
.

Eight
of
the
isolated-

HIT
patients
developed
thrombosis
within
the
next
30
d
;
thus
,
a
total
of
48
patients
had
thrombosis
at
day
30
.

At
diagnosis
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
OD
between
HIT
patients
with
thrombosis
and
those
with
isolated-
HIT
.

However
,
OD
was
significantly
higher
in
all
patients
with
thrombosis

(
n
=
48
,
1.34
+
/-
0.89
)
,
including
isolated-
HIT
patients
who
later
developed
thrombosis
within
30
d
(
n
=
8
,
1.84
+
/-
0.64
)
as
compared
to
isolated-
HIT
patients
who
did
not
develop
thrombosis
(
0.96
+
/-

0.75
;
P
=
0.011
and
P
=
0.008
)
.

The
Receiver
Operative
Characteristic
Curve
showed
that
OD
>
1.27
in
the
isolated-

HIT
group
had
a
significantly
higher
chance
of
developing
thrombosis
by
day
30
.

None
of
these
groups
showed
significant
difference
in
percent
inhibition
.

Multivariate
analysis
showed
a
2.8-fold
increased
risk
of
thrombosis
in
females
.

Similarly
,
thrombotic
risk
increased
with
age
and
OD
values
.

CONCLUSION
:

Higher
OD
is
associated
with
significant
risk
of
subsequent
thrombosis
in
patients
with
isolated-
HIT
;
percent
inhibition
,
however
,
was
not
predictive

occlusion
associated
with
clomiphene
-induced
ovulation
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
central
retinal
vein
occlusion
associated
with
clomiphene
citrate

(
CC
)
.

DESIGN
:

Case
study
.

SETTING
:

Ophthalmology
clinic
of
an
academic
hospital
.

PATIENT(S
)
:

A
36-year
-
old
woman
referred
from
the
infertility
clinic
for
blurred
vision
.

INTERVENTION(S
)

:
Ophthalmic
examination
after
CC
therapy
.

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURE(S
)
:

Central
retinal
vein
occlusion
after
ovulation
induction
with
CC
.

RESULT(S
)
:

A
36-year
-
old
Chinese
woman
developed
central
retinal
vein
occlusion
after
eight
courses
of
CC
.

A
search
of
the
literature
on
the
thromboembolic
complications
of
CC
does
not
include
this
severe
ophthalmic
complication
,
although
mild
visual
disturbance
after
CC
intake
is
not
uncommon
.

CONCLUSION(S
)
:
This
is
the
first
reported
case
of
central
retinal
vein
occlusion
after
treatment
with
CC
.

Extra
caution
is
warranted
in
treating
infertility
patients
with
CC
,
and
patients
should
be
well
informed
of
this
side
effect
before
commencement
of
therapy

Nicotine
-induced

nystagmus
correlates
with
midpontine
activation
.

The
pathomechanism
of
nicotine
-induced
nystagmus

(
NIN
)
is
unknown
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
delineate
brain
structures
that
are
involved
in
NIN
generation
.

Eight
healthy
volunteers
inhaled
nicotine
in
darkness
during
a
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
fMRI
)
experiment
;
eye
movements
were
registered
using
video
-
oculography
.

NIN
correlated
with
blood
oxygen
level
-
dependent
(
BOLD
)
activity
levels
in
a
midpontine
site
in
the
posterior
basis
pontis
.

NIN

-induced
midpontine
activation
may
correspond
to
activation
of
the
dorsomedial
pontine
nuclei
and
the
nucleus
reticularis

pontis
,
structures
known
to
participate
in
the

Protective
effect
of
verapamil
on
gastric
hemorrhagic
ulcers
in
severe
atherosclerotic
rats
.

Studies
concerning
with
pathogenesis
of
gastric
hemorrhage
and
mucosal
ulceration
produced
in
atherosclerotic
rats
are
lacking
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
examine
the
role
of
gastric
acid
back
-
diffusion
,
mast
cell
histamine
release
,
lipid
peroxide
(
LPO
)
generation
and
mucosal
microvascular
permeability
in
modulating
gastric
hemorrhage
and
ulcer
in
rats
with
atherosclerosis
induced
by
coadministration
of
vitamin
D2
and
cholesterol
.

Additionally
,
the
protective
effect
of
verapamil
on
this
ulcer
model
was
evaluated
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
challenged
intragastrically
once
daily
for
9
days
with
1.0
ml
/
kg
of
corn
oil
containing
vitamin
D2
and
cholesterol
to
induce
atherosclerosis
.

Control
rats
received
corn
oil
only
.

After
gastric
surgery
,
rat
stomachs
were
irrigated
for
3
h
with
either
simulated
gastric
juice
or
normal
saline
.

Gastric
acid
back
-
diffusion
,
mucosal
LPO
generation
,
histamine
concentration
,
microvascular
permeability
,
luminal
hemoglobin
content
and
ulcer
areas
were
determined
.

Elevated
atherosclerotic
parameters
,
such
as
serum

calcium
,
total
cholesterol
and
low
-
density
lipoprotein
concentration
were
obtained
in
atherosclerotic
rats
.

Severe
gastric

ulcers
accompanied
with
increased
ulcerogenic
factors
,
including
gastric
acid
back
-
diffusion
,
histamine
release
,
LPO
generation
and
luminal
hemoglobin
content
were
also
observed
in
these
rats
.

Moreover
,
a
positive
correlation
of
histamine
to
gastric
hemorrhage
and
to
ulcer
was
found
in
those
atherosclerotic
rats
.

This
hemorrhagic

ulcer
and
various
ulcerogenic
parameters
were
dose
-
dependently
ameliorated
by
daily
intragastric
verapamil
.

Atherosclerosis
could
produce
gastric
hemorrhagic

ulcer
via
aggravation
of
gastric
acid
back
-
diffusion
,
LPO
generation
,
histamine
release
and
microvascular
permeability
that
could
be
ameliorated
by

Adriamycin
-induced
autophagic
cardiomyocyte

death
plays
a
pathogenic
role
in
a
rat
model
of
heart
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
mechanisms
underlying
heart
failure
induced
by
adriamycin
are
very
complicated
and
still
unclear
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
whether
autophagy
was
involved
in
the
progression
of
heart
failure
induced
by
adriamycin
,
so
that
we
can
develop
a
novel
treatment
strategy
for
heart
failure
.

METHODS
:
3-methyladenine

(
3MA
)
,
a
specific
inhibitor
on
autophagy
was
used
in
a
heart
failure
model
of
rats
induced
by
adriamycin
.

Neonatal
cardiomyocytes
were
isolated
from
Sprague
-
Dawley
rat
hearts
and
randomly
divided
into
controls
,
an
adriamycin
-treated
group
,
and
a
3MA
plus
adriamycin
-treated
group
.

We
then
examined
the
morphology
,
expression
of
beclin
1
gene
,
mitochondrial
permeability
transition
(
MPT
)
,
and
Na+-
K
+
ATPase
activity
in
vivo
.

We
also
assessed
cell
viability
,
mitochondrial
membrane
potential
changes
and
counted
autophagic
vacuoles
in
cultured
cardiomyocytes
.

In
addition
,
we
analyzed
the
expression
of
autophagy
associated
gene
,
beclin
1
using
RT
-
PCR
and
Western
blotting
in
an
animal
model
.

RESULTS
:

3MA
significantly
improved
cardiac
function
and
reduced
mitochondrial
injury
.

Furthermore
,
adriamycin
induced
the
formation
of
autophagic
vacuoles
,
and
3MA
strongly
downregulated
the
expression
of
beclin
1
in
adriamycin

-induced
failing
heart
and
inhibited
the
formation
of
autophagic
vacuoles
.

CONCLUSION
:

Autophagic
cardiomyocyte

death
plays
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
heart
failure
in
rats
induced
by
adriamycin
.

Mitochondrial
injury
may
be
involved
in
the
progression
of
heart
failure
caused
by
adriamycin
via
the
autophagy
pathway
.

Confusion
,
a
rather
serious
adverse
drug
reaction
with
valproic
acid
:
a
review
of
the
French
Pharmacovigilance
database
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Confusion
is
an
adverse
drug
reaction
frequently
observed
with
valproic
acid
.

Some
case
reports
are
published
in
the
literature
but
no
systematic
study
from
a
sample
of
patients
has
been
published
.

We
performed
this
study
in
order
to
describe
the
main
characteristics
of
this
adverse
drug
reaction
.

METHODS
:
Using
the
French
Pharmacovigilance
database
,
we
selected
the
cases
of
confusion
reported
since
1985
with
valproic
acid
.

RESULTS
:

272
cases
of
confusion
were
reported
with
valproic
acid
:
153
women
and
119
men
.

Confusion
mostly
occurred
during
the
two
first
weeks
following
valproic
acid
exposure
(
39.7
%
)
.

It
was
"
serious
"
for
almost
2/3
of
the
patients
(
62.5
%
)
and
its
outcome
favourable
in
most
of
the
cases
(
82
%
)
.

The
occurrence
of
this
ADR
was
more
frequent
in
patients
aged
between
61
and
80
years
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
work
shows
that
confusion
with
valproic
acid
is
a
serious
,
rather
frequent
but
reversible
adverse
drug
reaction
.

It
occurs
especially
in
older
patients
and
during
the
first
two
weeks
of
treatment
.

Learning
and
memory
deficits
in
ecstasy
users
and
their
neural
correlates
during
a
face
-
learning
task
.

It
has
been
consistently
shown
that
ecstasy
users
display
impairments
in
learning
and
memory
performance
.

In
addition
,
working
memory
processing
in
ecstasy
users
has
been
shown
to
be
associated
with
neural
alterations
in
hippocampal
and/or
cortical
regions
as
measured
by
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
fMRI
)
.

Using
functional
imaging
and
a
face
-
learning
task
,
we
investigated
neural
correlates
of
encoding
and
recalling
face
-
name
associations
in
20
recreational
drug
users
whose
predominant
drug
use
was
ecstasy
and
20
controls
.

To
address
the
potential
confounding
effects
of
the
cannabis
use
of
the
ecstasy
using
group
,
a
second
analysis
included
14
previously
tested
cannabis
users

Deficits
in
learning
and
memory
:
parahippocampal
hyperactivity
and
frontocortical
hypoactivity
in
cannabis
users
.

Neuroimage

,
1328
-

)
.

Ecstasy
users
performed
significantly
worse
in
learning
and
memory
compared
to
controls
and
cannabis
users
.

A
conjunction
analysis
of
the
encode
and
recall
phases
of
the
task
revealed
ecstasy
-specific
hyperactivity
in
bilateral
frontal
regions
,
left
temporal
,
right
parietal
,
bilateral
temporal
,
and
bilateral
occipital
brain
regions
.

Ecstasy
-specific
hypoactivity
was
evident
in
the
right
dorsal
anterior
cingulated
cortex
(
ACC
)
and
left
posterior
cingulated
cortex
.

In
both
ecstasy
and
cannabis
groups
brain
activation
was
decreased
in
the
right
medial
frontal
gyrus
,
left
parahippocampal
gyrus
,
left
dorsal
cingulate
gyrus
,
and
left
caudate
.

These
results
elucidated
ecstasy
-related
deficits
,
only
some
of
which
might
be
attributed
to
cannabis
use
.

These
ecstasy
-specific
effects
may
be
related
to
the
vulnerability
of
isocortical
and
allocortical
regions
to
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
ecstasy
.

Prolonged
elevation
of
plasma
argatroban
in
a
cardiac
transplant
patient
with
a
suspected
history
of

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
with
thrombosis
.

BACKGROUND
:

Direct
thrombin
inhibitors
(
DTIs
)
provide
an
alternative
method
of
anticoagulation
for
patients
with
a
history
of

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia

(
HIT
)
or
HIT
with
thrombosis

(
HITT
)
undergoing
cardiopulmonary
bypass
(
CPB
)
.

In
the
following
report
,
a
65-year
-
old
critically
ill
patient
with
a
suspected
history
of
HITT
was
administered

argatroban
for
anticoagulation
on
bypass
during
heart
transplantation
.

The
patient
required
massive
transfusion
support
(
55
units
of
red
blood
cells
,
42
units
of
fresh
-
frozen
plasma
,
40
units
of
cryoprecipitate
,
40
units
of
platelets
,
and
three
doses
of
recombinant
Factor
VIIa
)
for
severe
intraoperative
and
postoperative
bleeding
.

STUDY
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:

Plasma
samples
from
before
and
after
CPB
were
analyzed
postoperatively
for
argatroban
concentration
using
a
modified
ecarin
clotting
time
(
ECT
)
assay
.

RESULTS
:

Unexpectedly
high
concentrations
of
argatroban
were
measured
in
these
samples
(
range
,
0
-
32
microg
/
mL
)
,
and
a
prolonged
plasma
argatroban
half
life
(
t(1/2
)
)
of
514
minutes
was
observed
(
published
elimination
t(1/2
)
is
39
-
51
minutes
[
or
=
181
minutes
with
hepatic
impairment
]
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Correlation
of
plasma
argatroban
concentration
versus
the
patient
's
coagulation
variables
and
clinical
course
suggest
that
prolonged
elevated
levels
of
plasma
argatroban
may
have
contributed
to
the
patient
's
extended
coagulopathy
.

Because
DTIs
do
not
have
reversal
agents
,
surgical
teams
and
transfusion
services
should
remain
aware
of
the
possibility
of
massive
transfusion
events
during
anticoagulation
with
these
agents
.

This
is
the
first
report
to
measure
plasma

argatroban
concentration
in
the
context
of
CPB
and
extended
coagulopathy
.

(
ATT-
ALF
)
is
the
commonest
drug
-
induced
ALF
in
South
Asia
.

Prospective
studies
on
ATT-
ALF
are
lacking
.

The
current
study
prospectively
evaluated
the
magnitude
,
clinical
course
,
outcome
,
and
prognostic
factors
in
ATT-
ALF
.

From
January
1986
to
January
2009
,
1223
consecutive
ALF

patients
were
evaluated
:
ATT
alone
was
the
cause
in
70
(
5.7
%
)
patients
.

Another
15
(
1.2
%
)
had
ATT
and
simultaneous
hepatitis
virus
infection
.

In
44
(
62.8
%
)
patients
,
ATT
was
prescribed
empirically
without
definitive
evidence
of
tuberculosis
.

ATT-
ALF
patients
were
younger
(
32.87
[
+
/-15.8
]

years
)
,
and
49
(
70
%
)
of
them
were
women
.

Most
had
hyperacute
presentation
;
the
median
icterus

encephalopathy
interval
was
4.5
(
0
-
30
)
days
.

The
median
duration
of
ATT
before
ALF
was
30
(
7
-
350
)
days
.

At
presentation
,
advanced
encephalopathy
and
cerebral
edema
were
present
in
51
(
76
%
)
and
29
(
41.4
%
)
patients
,
respectively
.

Gastrointestinal
bleed
,
seizures
,
infection
,
and
acute
renal
failure
were
documented
in
seven
(
10
%
)
,
five
(
7.1
%
)
,
26
(
37.1
%
)
,
and
seven
(
10
%
)
patients
,
respectively
.

Compared
with
hepatitis
E
virus
(
HEV
)
and
non
-
A
non
-
E
-
induced
ALF
,
ATT-
ALF
patients
had
nearly
similar
presentations
except
for
older
age
and
less
elevation
of
liver
enzymes
.

The
mortality
rate
among
patients
with
ATT-
ALF
was
high
(
67.1
%
,
n
=
47
)
,
and
only
23
(
32.9
%
)
patients
recovered
with
medical
treatment
.

In
multivariate
analysis
,
three
factors
independently
predicted
mortality
:
serum
bilirubin

(
>
or=10.8
mg
/
dL
)
,
prothrombin
time
(
PT
)
prolongation
(
>
or=26
seconds
)
,
and
grade
III
/
IV

encephalopathy
at
presentation
.

CONCLUSION
:

ATT-
ALF
constituted
5.7
%
of
ALF
at
our
center
and
had
a
high
mortality
rate
.

Because
the
mortality
rate
is
so
high
,
determining
which
factors
are
predictors
is
less
important
.

A
high
proportion
of
patients
had
consumed
ATT
empirically
,
which
could
have
been
prevented
.

Central
nervous
system
complications
during
treatment
of
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
in
a
single
pediatric
institution
.

Central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
complications
during
treatment
of
childhood
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia

(
ALL
)
remain
a
challenging
clinical
problem
.

Outcome
improvement
with
more
intensive
chemotherapy
has
significantly
increased
the
incidence
and
severity
of
adverse
events
.

This
study
analyzed
the
incidence
of
neurological
complications
during
ALL
treatment
in
a
single
pediatric
institution
,
focusing
on
clinical
,
radiological
,
and
electrophysiological
findings
.

Exclusion
criteria
included
CNS
leukemic
infiltration
at
diagnosis
,
therapy
-
related
peripheral
neuropathy
,
late
-
onset
encephalopathy
,
or
long
-
term
neurocognitive
defects
.

During
a
9-year
period
,
we
retrospectively
collected
27
neurological
events
(
11
%
)
in
as
many
patients
,
from
253
children
enrolled
in
the
ALL
front
-
line
protocol
.

CNS
complications
included
posterior
reversible
leukoencephalopathy
syndrome
(
n
=
10
)
,
stroke

(
n
=
5
)
,

temporal
lobe
epilepsy
(
n
=
2
)
,
high
-
dose

methotrexate
toxicity

(
n
=
2
)
,
syndrome
of
inappropriate
antidiuretic
hormone
secretion

(
n
=
1
)
,
and
other
unclassified
events
(
n
=
7
)
.

In
conclusion
,
CNS
complications
are
frequent
events
during
ALL
therapy
,
and
require
rapid
detection
and
prompt
treatment
to
limit
permanent
damage
.

Safety
of
capecitabine
:
a
review
.

IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
FIELD
:

Fluoropyrimidines
,
in
particular
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
,
have
been
the
mainstay
of
treatment
for
several
solid
tumors
,
including
colorectal
,
breast
and
head
and
neck
cancers
,
for
>
40
years
.

AREAS
COVERED
IN
THIS
REVIEW
:

This
article
reviews
the
pharmacology
and
efficacy
of
capecitabine
with
a
special
emphasis
on
its
safety
.

WHAT
THE
READER
WILL
GAIN
:
The
reader
will
gain
better
insight
into
the
safety
of
capecitabine
in
special
populations
such
as
patients
with
advanced
age
,
renal
and
kidney
disease
.

We
also
explore
different
dosing
and
schedules
of
capecitabine
administration
.

TAKE
HOME
MESSAGE
:

Capecitabine
is
an
oral
prodrug
of
5-FU
and
was
developed
to
fulfill
the
need
for
a
more
convenient
therapy
and
provide
an
improved
safety
/
efficacy
profile
.

It
has
shown
promising
results
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
in
colorectal
,
breast
,
pancreaticobiliary
,
gastric
,
renal
cell
and
head
and
neck
cancers
.

The
most
commonly
reported
toxic
effects
of
capecitabine
are
diarrhea
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
stomatitis
and
hand
-
foot
syndrome
.

Capecitabine
has
a
well
-
established
safety
profile
and
can
be
given
safely
to
patients
with
advanced
age
,
hepatic
and
renal
dysfunctions
.

Effects
of
pallidal
neurotensin
on
haloperidol

-induced

parkinsonian
catalepsy
:
behavioral
and
electrophysiological
studies
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
globus
pallidus
plays
a
critical
role
in
movement
regulation
.

Previous
studies
have
indicated
that
the
globus
pallidus
receives
neurotensinergic
innervation
from
the
striatum
,
and
systemic
administration
of
a
neurotensin
analog
could
produce
antiparkinsonian
effects
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
effects
of
pallidal
neurotensin
on
haloperidol
-induced
parkinsonian
symptoms
.

METHODS
:
Behavioral
experiments
and
electrophysiological
recordings
were
performed
in
the
present
study
.

RESULTS
:

Bilateral
infusions
of
neurotensin
into
the
globus
pallidus
reversed

haloperidol
-induced

parkinsonian
catalepsy
in
rats
.

Electrophysiological
recordings
showed
that
microinjection
of
neurotensin
induced
excitation
of
pallidal
neurons
in
the
presence
of
systemic
haloperidol
administration
.

The
neurotensin
type-1
receptor
antagonist

SR48692
blocked
both
the
behavioral
and
the
electrophysiological
effects
induced
by
neurotensin
.

CONCLUSION
:

Activation
of
pallidal
neurotensin
receptors
may
be
involved
in
neurotensin

-induced
antiparkinsonian
effects
.

Antihypertensive
drugs
and
depression
:
a
reappraisal
.

Eighty
-
nine
new
referral

hypertensive
out
-
patients
and
46
new
referral
non-

hypertensive
chronically
physically
ill
out
-
patients
completed
a
mood
rating
scale
at
regular
intervals
for
one
year
.

The
results
showed
a
high
prevalence
of
depression
in
both
groups
of
patients
,
with
no
preponderance
in
the
hypertensive
group
.

Hypertensive
patients
with
psychiatric
histories
had
a
higher
prevalence
of
depression
than
the
comparison
patients
.

This
was
accounted
for
by
a
significant
number
of
depressions
occurring
in

methyl
dopa
treated
patients
with
psychiatric
histories
.

Pulmonary
shunt
and
cardiovascular
responses
to
CPAP
during
nitroprusside

-induced

hypotension
.

The
effects
of
continuous
positive
airway
pressure
(
CPAP
)
on
cardiovascular
dynamics
and
pulmonary
shunt
(
QS
/
QT
)
were
investigated
in
12
dogs
before
and
during
sodium
nitroprusside
infusion
that
decreased
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
40
-
50
per
cent
.

Before
nitroprusside
infusion
,
5
cm
H2O
CPAP
significantly
,
P
less
than
.05
,
decreased
arterial
blood
pressure
,
but
did
not
significantly
alter
heart
rate
,
cardiac
output
,
systemic
vascular
resistance
,
or
QS
/
QT
.

Ten
cm
H2O
CPAP
before
nitroprusside
infusion
produced
a
further
decrease
in
arterial
blood
pressure
and
significantly
increased
heart
rate
and
decreased
cardiac
output
and
QS
/
QT
.

Nitroprusside
caused
significant

decreases
in
arterial
blood
pressure
and
systemic
vascular
resistance
and
increases
in
heart
rate
,
but
did
not
change
cardiac
output
or
QS
/
QT
.

Five
cm
H2O
CPAP
during

nitroprusside
did
not
further
alter
any
of
the
above
-
mentioned
variables
.

However
,
10
cm
H2O
CPAP
decreased
arterial
blood
pressure
,
cardiac
output
,
and
QS
/
QT
.

These
data
indicate
that
nitroprusside
infusion
rates
that
decrease
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
by
40
-
50
per
cent
do
not
change
cardiac
output
or
QS
/
QT
.

During
nitroprusside
infusion
low
levels
of
CPAP
do
not
markedly
alter
cardiovascular
dynamics
,
but
high
levels
of
CPAP
(
10
cm
H2O
)
,
while
decreasing
QS
/
QT
,
produce
marked
decreases
in
arterial
blood
pressure
and
cardiac
output
.

Mediation
of
enhanced
reflex
vagal
bradycardia
by
L
-
dopa
via
central
dopamine
formation
in
dogs
.

L
-
Dopa
(
5
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)

decreased
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
after
extracerebral
decarboxylase
inhibition
with
MK-486

(
25
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)

in
anesthetize

MAO
-inhibited
dogs
.

In
addition
,
reflex
bradycardia
caused
by
injected
norepinephrine
was
significantly
enhanced
by
L
-
dopa
,

DL
-
Threo
-
dihydroxyphenylserine
had
no
effect
on
blood
pressure
,
heart
rate
or
reflex
responses
to
norepinephrine
.

FLA-63
,
a
dopamine
-beta
-
oxidase
inhibitor
,
did
not
have
any
effect
on
the
hypotension
,
bradycardia
or
reflex
-
enhancing
effect
of
L
-
dopa
.

Pimozide
did
not
affect
the
actions
of
L
-
dopa
on
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
but
completely
blocked
the
enhancement
of
reflexes
.

Removal
of
the
carotid
sinuses
caused
an
elevation
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
and
abolished
the
negative
chronotropic
effect
of
norepinephrine
.

However
,
L
-
dopa
restored
the
bradycardia
caused
by
norepinephrine
in
addition
to
decreasing
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

5-HTP
(
5
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)
decreased
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
and
decreased
the
reflex
bradycardia
to
norepinephrine
.

It
is
concluded
that
L
-
dopa
enhances
reflex
bradycardia
through
central
alpha
-
receptor
stimulation
.

Furthermore
,
the
effects
are
mediated
through
dopamine
rather
than
norepinephrine
and
do
not
require
the
carotid
sinus
baroreceptors
.

Cocaine
-induced
myocardial
infarction
:
clinical
observations
and
pathogenetic
considerations
.

Clinical
and
experimental
data
published
to
date
suggest
several
possible
mechanisms
by
which
cocaine
may
result
in
acute
myocardial
infarction
.

In
individuals
with
preexisting
,
high
-
grade
coronary
arterial
narrowing
,
acute
myocardial
infarction
may
result
from
an
increase
in
myocardial
oxygen
demand
associated
with
cocaine
-induced
increase
in
rate
-
pressure
product
.

In
other
individuals
with
no
underlying
atherosclerotic
obstruction
,
coronary
occlusion
may
be
due
to
spasm
,
thrombus
,
or
both
.

With
regard
to
spasm
,
the
clinical
findings
are
largely
circumstantial
,
and
the
locus
of
cocaine

-induced
vasoconstriction
remains
speculative
.

Although
certain
clinical
and
experimental
findings
support
the
hypothesis
that
spasm
involves
the
epicardial
,
medium
-
size
vessels
,
other
data
suggest
intramural
vasoconstriction
.

Diffuse
intramural
vasoconstriction
is
not
consistent
with
reports
of
segmental
,
discrete
infarction
.

Whereas
certain
in
vivo
data
suggest
that
these
effects
are
alpha
-
mediated
,
other
in
vitro
data
suggest
the
opposite
.

The
finding
of
cocaine
-induced
vasoconstriction
in
segments
of
(
noninnervated
)

human
umbilical
artery
suggests
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
intact
innervation
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
discrepant
data
involving
the
possibility
of
alpha
-
mediated
effects
.

Finally
,
the
contribution
of
a
primary
,
thrombotic
effect
of
cocaine
has
not
been
excluded
.

Rabbit
syndrome
,
antidepressant
use
,
and
cerebral
perfusion
SPECT
scan
findings
.

The
rabbit
syndrome
is
an
extrapyramidal
side
effect
associated
with
chronic
neuroleptic
therapy
.

Its
occurrence
in
a
patient
being
treated
with
imipramine
is
described
,
representing
the
first
reported
case
of
this
syndrome
in
conjunction
with
antidepressants
.

Repeated
cerebral
perfusion
SPECT
scans
revealed

decreased
basal
ganglia
perfusion
while
the
movement
disorder
was
present
,
and
a
return
to
normal
perfusion
when
the
rabbit
syndrome
resolved
.

Acute
bronchodilating
effects
of
ipratropium
bromide
and
theophylline
in
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
.

The
bronchodilator
effects
of
a
single
dose
of
ipratropium
bromide
aerosol
(
36
micrograms
)
and
short
-
acting

theophylline
tablets
(
dose
titrated
to
produce
serum
levels
of
10
-
20
micrograms
/
mL
)
were
compared
in
a
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
crossover
study
in
21
patients
with
stable
,
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
.

Mean
peak
forced
expiratory
volume
in
1
second
(
FEV1
)
increases
over
baseline
and
the
proportion
of
patients
attaining
at
least
a
15
%
increase
in
the
FEV1
(
responders
)
were
31
%
and
90
%
,
respectively
,
for
ipratropium
and
17
%
and
50
%
,
respectively
,
for
theophylline
.

The
average
FEV1
increases
during
the
6-hour
observation
period
were
18
%
for
ipratropium
and
8
%
for
theophylline
.

The
mean
duration
of
action
was
3.8
hours
with
ipratropium
and
2.4
hours
with
theophylline
.

While
side
effects
were
rare
,
those
experienced
after
theophylline
use
did
involve
the
cardiovascular
and
gastrointestinal
systems
.

These
results
show
that
ipratropium
is
a
more
potent
bronchodilator
than
oral
theophylline
in
patients
with
chronic
airflow
obstruction
.

Irreversible
damage
to
the
medullary
interstitium
in
experimental
analgesic
nephropathy
in
F344
rats
.

Renal
papillary
necrosis

(
RPN
)
and
a
decreased
urinary
concentrating
ability
developed
during
continuous
long
-
term
treatment
with
aspirin
and
paracetamol
in
female
Fischer
344
rats
.

Renal
structure
and
concentrating
ability
were
examined
after
a
recovery
period
of
up
to
18
weeks
,
when
no
analgesics
were
given
,
to
investigate
whether
the
analgesic
-
induced
changes
were
reversible
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
repair
to
the
damaged
medullary
interstitial
matrix
,
or
proliferation
of
remaining
undamaged
type
1
medullary
interstitial
cells
after
the
recovery
period
following
analgesic
treatment
.

The
recovery
of
urinary
concentrating
ability
was
related
to
the
length
of
analgesic
treatment
and
the
extent
of
the
resulting
inner
medullary
structural
damage
.

During
the
early
stages
of
analgesic
treatment
,
the
changes
in
urinary
concentrating
ability
were
reversible
,
but
after
prolonged
analgesic
treatment
,
maximum
urinary
concentrating
ability
failed
to
recover
.

This
study
shows
that
prolonged
analgesic
treatment
in
Fischer
344
rats
causes
progressive
and
irreversible
damage
to
the
interstitial
matrix
and
type
1
interstitial
cells
leading
to
RPN
.

The
associated
urinary
concentrating
defect
is
reversible
only
during
the
early
stages
of
structural
damage
to
the
inner
medulla
.

Less
frequent
lithium
administration
and
lower
urine
volume
.

OBJECTIVE
:

This
study
was
designed
to
determine
whether
patients
maintained
on
a
regimen
of
lithium
on
a
once
-
per
-
day
schedule
have
lower
urine
volumes
than
do
patients
receiving
multiple
doses
per
day
.

METHOD
:

This
was
a
cross
-
sectional
study
of
85
patients
from
a
lithium
clinic
who
received
different
dose
schedules
.

Patients
were
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
measurement
of
lithium
level
,
creatinine
clearance
,
urine
volume
,
and
maximum
osmolality
.

RESULTS
:

Multiple
daily
doses
of
lithium
were
associated
with
higher
urine
volumes
.

The
dosing
schedule
,
duration
of
lithium
treatment
,
and
daily
dose
of
lithium
did
not
affect
maximum
osmolality
or
creatinine
clearance
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Urine
volume
can
be
reduced
by
giving
lithium
once
daily
and/or
by
lowering
the
total
daily
dose
.

Lithium
-induced

polyuria
seems
to
be
related
to
extrarenal
as
well
as
to
renal
effects
.

was
studied
using
a
tumor
growth
delay
assay
.

Acute
normal
tissue
toxicities
(
i.e.
,
leukopenia
and
thrombocytopenia
)
and
late
normal
tissue
toxicities
(
i.e.
,
myocardial
and
kidney
injury
)
were
evaluated
by
functional
/
physiological
assays
and
by
morphological
techniques
.

Whole
body
hyperthermia

(
120
min
at
41.5
degrees
C
)
enhanced
both
Adriamycin
-mediated
antitumor
activity
and
toxic
side
effects
.

The
thermal
enhancement
ratio
calculated
for
antitumor
activity
was
1.6
.

Thermal
enhancement
ratios
estimated
for
"
acute
"
hematological
changes
were
1.3
,
whereas
those
estimated
for
"
late
"
damage
(
based
on
morphological
cardiac
and
renal
lesions
)
varied
between
2.4
and
4.3
.

Thus
,
while
whole
body
hyperthermia
enhances
Adriamycin
-mediated
antitumor
effect
,
normal
tissue
toxicity
is
also
increased
,
and
the
potential
therapeutic
gain
of
the
combined
modality
treatment
is
eroded
.

Prazosin
-induced
stress
incontinence
.

A
case
of
genuine
stress
incontinence
due
to
prazosin
,
a
common
antihypertensive
drug
,
is
presented
.

Prazosin
exerts
its
antihypertensive
effects
through
vasodilatation
caused
by
selective
blockade
of
postsynaptic
alpha-1
adrenergic
receptors
.

As
an
alpha
-
blocker
,
it
also
exerts
a
significant
relaxant
effect
on
the
bladder
neck
and
urethra
.

The
patient
's
clinical
course
is
described
and
correlated
with
initial
urodynamic
studies
while
on
prazosin
and
subsequent
studies
while
taking
verapamil
.

Her
incontinence
resolved
with
the
change
of
medication
.

The
restoration
of
continence
was
accompanied
by
a
substantial
rise
in
maximum
urethral
pressure
,
maximum
urethral
closure
pressure
,
and
functional
urethral
length
.

Patients
who
present
with
stress
incontinence
while
taking
prazosin
should
change
their
antihypertensive
medication
before
considering
surgery
,
because
their
incontinence
may
resolve
spontaneously
with
a
change
in
drug
therapy
.

Myocardial
infarction
following
sublingual
administration
of
isosorbide
dinitrate
.

A
78-year
-
old
with
healed
septal
necrosis
suffered
a
recurrent
myocardial
infarction
of
the
anterior
wall
following
the
administration
of
isosorbide
dinitrate

5
mg
sublingually
.

After
detailing
the
course
of
events
,
we
discuss
the
role
of
paradoxical
coronary
spasm
and
hypotension
-mediated

myocardial
ischemia
occurring
downstream
to
significant
coronary
arterial
stenosis
in
the
pathophysiology
of
acute
coronary
insufficiency
.

Fluoxetine
-induced
akathisia
:
clinical
and
theoretical
implications
.

Five
patients
receiving
fluoxetine
for
the
treatment
of
obsessive
compulsive
disorder
or
major
depression
developed
akathisia
.

The
typical
fluoxetine
-induced
symptoms
of
restlessness
,
constant
pacing
,
purposeless
movements
of
the
feet
and
legs
,
and
marked
anxiety
were
indistinguishable
from
those
of
neuroleptic
-
induced
akathisia
.

Three
patients
who
had
experienced
neuroleptic
-
induced
akathisia
in
the
past
reported
that
the
symptoms
of
fluoxetine
-induced

akathisia
were
identical
,
although
somewhat
milder
.

Akathisia
appeared
to
be
a
common
side
effect
of
fluoxetine
and
generally
responded
well
to
treatment
with
the
beta
-
adrenergic
antagonist
propranolol
,
dose
reduction
,
or
both
.

The
authors
suggest
that
fluoxetine
-induced
akathisia
may
be
caused
by
serotonergically
mediated
inhibition
of
dopaminergic
neurotransmission
and
that
the
pathophysiology
of
fluoxetine
-induced
akathisia
and
tricyclic

antidepressant
-induced
"
jitteriness
"
may
be
identical
.

Chronic
active
hepatitis
associated
with
diclofenac
sodium
therapy
.

Diclofenac
sodium

(
Voltarol
,
Geigy
Pharmaceuticals
)
is
a
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
derivative
of
phenylacetic
acid
.

Although
generally
well
-
tolerated
,
asymptomatic
abnormalities
of
liver
function
have
been
recorded
and
,

less
commonly
,
severe
hepatitis
induced
by
diclofenac
.

The
patient
described
developed

chronic
active
hepatitis
after
six
months
therapy
with
diclofenac
sodium
which
progressed
despite
the
withdrawal
of
the
drug
,
a
finding
not
previously
reported
.

Stroke
associated
with
cocaine
use
.

We
describe
eight
patients
in
whom
cocaine
use
was
related
to
stroke
and
review
39
cases
from
the
literature
.

Among
these
47
patients
the
mean
(
+
/-
SD
)
age
was
32.5
+
/-
12.1
years
;
76
%
(
34/45
)
were
men
.

Stroke
followed
cocaine
use
by
inhalation
,
intranasal
,
intravenous
,
and
intramuscular
routes
.

Intracranial
aneurysms
or
arteriovenous
malformations
were
present
in
17
of
32
patients
studied
angiographically
or
at
autopsy
;
cerebral
vasculitis
was
present
in
two
patients
.

Cerebral
infarction
occurred
in
10
patients
(
22
%
)
,
intracerebral
hemorrhage
in
22
(
49
%
)
,
and
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
in
13
(
29
%
)
.

These
data
indicate
that
(
1
)
the
apparent
incidence
of
stroke
related
to
cocaine
use
is
increasing
;

(
2
)
cocaine
-associated
stroke
occurs
primarily
in
young
adults
;

(
3
)
stroke
may
follow
any
route
of
cocaine
administration
;

(
4
)
stroke
after
cocaine
use
is
frequently
associated
with
intracranial
aneurysms
and
arteriovenous
malformations
;
and
(
5
)
in
cocaine

-associated

stroke
,
the
frequency
of
intracranial
hemorrhage
exceeds
that
of
cerebral
infarction
.

Glyburide
-induced
hepatitis
.

Drug
-
induced
hepatotoxicity
,
although
common
,
has
been
reported
only
infrequently
with
sulfonylureas
.

For
glyburide
,
a
second
-
generation
sulfonylurea
,
only
two
brief
reports
of
hepatotoxicity
exist
.

Two
patients
with
type
II
diabetes
mellitus
developed
an
acute
hepatitis
-
like
syndrome
soon
after
initiation
of
glyburide
therapy
.

There
was
no
serologic
evidence
of
viral
infection
,
and
a
liver
biopsy
sample
showed
a
histologic
pattern
consistent
with
drug
-
induced
hepatitis
.

Both
patients
recovered
quickly
after
stopping
glyburide
therapy
and
have
remained
well
for
a
follow
-
up
period
of
1
year
.

Glyburide
can
produce
an
acute
hepatitis
-
like
illness
in
some
persons
.

Systolic
pressure
variation
is
greater
during
hemorrhage
than
during
sodium
nitroprusside
-induced

hypotension
in
ventilated
dogs
.

The
systolic
pressure
variation
(
SPV
)
,
which
is
the
difference
between
the
maximal
and
minimal
values
of
the
systolic
blood
pressure
(
SBP
)
after
one
positive
-
pressure
breath
,
was
studied
in
ventilated
dogs
subjected
to
hypotension
.

Mean
arterial
pressure
was
decreased
to
50
mm
Hg
for
30
minutes
either
by
hemorrhage

(
HEM
,
n
=
7
)
or
by
continuous
infusion
of
sodium
nitroprusside

(
SNP
,
n
=
7
)
.

During
HEM
-induced

hypotension
the
cardiac
output
was
significantly
lower
and
systemic
vascular
resistance
higher
compared
with
that
in
the
SNP
group
.

The
systemic
,
central
venous
,
pulmonary
capillary
wedge
pressures
,
and
heart
rates
,
were
similar
in
the
two
groups
.

Analysis
of
the
respiratory
changes
in
the
arterial
pressure
waveform
enabled
differentiation
between
the
two
groups
.

The
SPV
during
hypotension
was
15.7
+
/-

6.7
mm
Hg
in
the
HEM
group
,
compared
with
9.1
+
/-

2.0
mm
Hg
in
the
SNP
group
(
P
less
than
0.02
)
.

The
delta
down
,
which
is
the
measure
of
decrease
of
SBP
after
a
mechanical
breath
,
was
20.3
+
/-

8.4
and
10.1
+
/-

3.8
mm
Hg
in
the
HEM
and
SNP
groups
,
respectively
,
during
hypotension

(
P
less
than
0.02
)
.

It
is
concluded
that
increases
in
the
SPV
and
the
delta
down
are
characteristic
of
a
hypotensive
state
due
to
a
predominant
decrease
in
preload
.

They
are
thus
more
important
during
absolute
hypovolemia
than
during
deliberate
hypotension
.

Drug
-
induced
arterial
spasm
relieved
by
lidocaine
.

Case
report
.

Following
major
intracranial
surgery
in
a
35-year
-
old
man
,
sodium
pentothal
was
intravenously
infused
to
minimize
cerebral
ischaemia
.

Intense
vasospasm
with
threatened

gangrene
arose
in
the
arm
used
for
the
infusion
.

Since
the
cranial
condition
precluded
use
of
more
usual
methods
,
lidocaine
was
given
intra
-
arterially
,
with
careful
cardiovascular
monitoring
,
to
counteract
the
vasospasm
.

The
treatment
was
rapidly
successful
.

Cerebral
blood
flow
and
metabolism
during
isoflurane

-induced

hypotension
in
patients
subjected
to
surgery
for
cerebral
aneurysms
.

Cerebral
blood
flow
and
cerebral
metabolic
rate
for
oxygen
were
measured
during

isoflurane
-induced

hypotension
in
10
patients
subjected
to
craniotomy
for
clipping
of
a
cerebral
aneurysm
.

Flow
and
metabolism
were
measured
5
-
13
days
after
the
subarachnoid
haemorrhage
by
a
modification
of
the
classical
Kety
-
Schmidt
technique
using

xenon
-133
i.v
.

Anaesthesia
was
maintained
with
an
inspired
isoflurane
concentration
of
0.75
%
(
plus
67
%
nitrous
oxide
in
oxygen
)
,
during
which
CBF
and
CMRO2
were
34.3
+
/-
2.1
ml/100
g
min-1
and
2.32
+
/-

0.16

ml/100
g
min-1
at
PaCO2
4.1
+
/-

0.1
kPa
(
mean
+
/-
SEM
)
.

Controlled
hypotension
to
an
average
MAP
of
50
-
55
mm
Hg
was
induced
by
increasing
the
dose
of
isoflurane
,
and
maintained
at
an
inspired
concentration
of
2.2
+
/-
0.2
%
.

This
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
in
CMRO2
(
to
1.73
+
/-

0.16

ml/100
g
min-1
)
,
while
CBF
was
unchanged
.

After
the
clipping
of
the
aneurysm
the
isoflurane
concentration
was
reduced
to
0.75
%
.

There
was
a
significant
increase
in
CBF
,
although
CMRO2
was
unchanged
,
compared
with
pre-
hypotensive
values
.

These
changes
might
offer
protection
to
brain
tissue
during
periods
of
induced
hypotension
.

Allergic
reaction
to
5-fluorouracil
infusion
.

An
allergic
reaction
consisting
of
angioneurotic
edema
secondary
to
continuous
infusion
5-fluorouracil
occurred
in
a
patient
with
recurrent
carcinoma
of
the
oral
cavity
,
cirrhosis
,
and
cisplatin
-induced
impaired
renal
function
.

This
reaction
occurred
during
the
sixth
and
seventh
courses
of
infusional
chemotherapy
.

Oral
diphenhydramine
and
prednisone
were
ineffective
in
preventing
the
recurrence
of
the
allergic
reaction
.

Discontinuance
of
effective
chemotherapy
in
this
patient
during
partial
remission
resulted
in
fatal
disease
progression
.

Amiodarone
-induced
sinoatrial
block
.

We
observed
sinoatrial
block
due
to
chronic
amiodarone
administration
in
a
5-year
-
old
boy
with
primary
cardiomyopathy
,
Wolff
-
Parkinson
-
White
syndrome
and
supraventricular
tachycardia
.

Reduction
in
the
dosage
of

amiodarone
resulted
in
the
disappearance
of
the
sinoatrial
block
and
the
persistence
of
asymptomatic
sinus
bradycardia
.

Possible
teratogenicity
of
sulphasalazine
.

Three
infants
,
born
of
two
mothers
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
who
received
treatment
with
sulphasalazine
throughout
pregnancy
,
were
found
to
have
major
congenital
anomalies
.

In
the
singleton
pregnancy
,
the
mother
had
ulcerative
colitis
,
and
the
infant
,
a
male
,
had
coarctation
of
the
aorta
and
a
ventricular
septal
defect
.

In
the
twin
pregnancy
,
the
mother
had
Crohn
's
disease
.

The
first
twin
,
a
female
,
had
a
left
Potter
-
type
IIa
polycystic
kidney
and
a
rudimentary
left
uterine
cornu
.

The
second
twin
,
a
male
,
had
some
features
of
Potter
's
facies
,
hypoplastic
lungs
,
absent
kidneys
and
ureters
,
and
talipes
equinovarus
.

Despite
reports
to
the
contrary
,
it
is
suggested
that
sulphasalazine
may
be
teratogenic
.

Veno
-
occlusive
liver
disease
after
dacarbazine
therapy
(
DTIC
)
for
melanoma
.

A
case
of
veno
-
occlusive
disease
of
the
liver
with
fatal
outcome
after
dacarbazine

(
DTIC
)
therapy
for
melanoma
is
reported
.

There
was
a
fulminant
clinical
course
from
start
of
symptoms
until
death
.

At
autopsy
the
liver
was
enlarged
and
firm
with
signs
of
venous
congestion
.

Small-
and

medium
-
sized
hepatic
veins
were
blocked
by
thrombosis
.

Eosinophilic
infiltrations
were
found
around
the
vessels
.

Published
cases
from
the
literature
are
reviewed
and
pertinent
features
discussed
.

A
case
of
tardive
dyskinesia
caused
by
metoclopramide
.

Abnormal
involuntary
movements
appeared
in
the
mouth
,
tongue
,
neck
and
abdomen
of
a
64-year
-
old
male
patient
after
he
took
metoclopramide
for
gastrointestinal
disorder
in
a
regimen
of
30
mg
per
day
for
a
total
of
about
260
days
.

The
symptoms
exacerbated
to
a
maximum
in
a
month
.

When
the
metoclopramide
administration
was
discontinued
,
the
abnormal
movements
gradually
improved
to
a
considerable
extent
.

Attention
to
the
possible
induction
of
specific
tardive
dyskinesia
is
called
for
in
the
use
of
this
drug
.

Further
observations
on
the
electrophysiologic
effects
of
oral
amiodarone
therapy
.

A
case
is
presented
of
a
reversible
intra
-
Hisian
block
occurring
under
amiodarone
treatment
for
atrial
tachycardia
in
a
patient
without
clear
intraventricular
conduction
abnormalities
.

His
bundle
recordings
showed
an
atrial
tachycardia
with
intermittent
exit
block
and
greatly
prolonged
BH
and
HV
intervals
(
40
and
100
msec
,
respectively
)
.

Thirty
days
after
amiodarone
discontinuation
,
His
bundle
electrograms
showed
atrial
flutter
without
intra
-
Hisian
or
infra
-
Hisian
delay
.

Amiodarone
should
be
used
with
caution
during
long
-
term
oral
therapy
in
patients
with
or
without
clear
intraventricular
conduction
defects
.

Busulfan
-induced
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

A
case
of
a
busulfan
-induced
hemorrhage
cystitis
is
reported
.

Spontaneous
resolution
occurred
following
cessation
of
the
drug
.

The
similarity
between
the
histologic
appearances
of
busulfan
cystitis
and
both
radiation
and
cyclophosphamide
-induced

cystitis
is
discussed
and
the
world
literature
reviewed
.

In
view
of
the
known
tendency
of
busulfan
to
induce
cellular
atypia
and
carcinoma
in
other
sites
,
periodic
urinary
cytology
is
suggested
in
patients
on
long
-
term
therapy
.

Rebound

hypertensive
after
sodium
nitroprusside
prevented
by
saralasin
in
rats
.

The
role
of
the
renin--
angiotensin
system
in
the
maintenance
of
blood
pressure
during
halothane
anesthesia
and
sodium
nitroprusside

(
SNP
)
-induced

hypotension
was
evaluated
.

Control
rats
received
halothane
anesthesia
(
1
MAC
)
for
one
hour
,
followed
by
SNP
infusion
,
40
microgram
/
kg
/
min
,
for
30
min
,
followed
by
a
30-min
recovery
period
.

A
second
group
of
rats
was
treated
identically
and
,
in
addition
,
received
an
infusion
of
saralasin

(
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
angiotensin
II
)
throughout
the
experimental
period
.

In
each
group
,
SNP
infusion
resulted
in
an
initial
decrease
in
blood
pressure
from
86
torr
and
83
torr
,
respectively
,
to
48
torr
.

During
the
SNP
infusion
the
control
animals
demonstrated
a
progressive
increase
in
blood
pressure
to
61
torr
,
whereas
the
saralasin
-treated
animals
showed
no
change
.

Following
discontinuation
of
SNP
,
blood
pressure
in
the
control
animals
rebounded
to
94
torr
,
as
compared
with
78
torr
in
the
saralasin
-treated
rats
.

This
study
indicates
that
with
stable
halothane
anesthesia
,
the
partial
recovery
of
blood
pressure
during
SNP
infusion
and
the
post-
SNP
rebound
of
blood
pressure
can
be
completely
blocked
by
saralasin
.

This
demonstrates
the
participation
of
the
renin--
angiotensin
system
in
antagonizing
the
combined
hypotensive
effects
of
halothane
and
SNP
.

Toxic
hepatitis
induced
by
antithyroid
drugs
:
four
cases
including
one
with
cross
-
reactivity
between
carbimazole
and
benzylthiouracil
.

OBJECTIVE
:

This
study
was
conducted
to
assess
the
occurrence
of
hepatic
adverse
effects
encountered
with
antithyroid
drugs
.

METHODS
:

Retrospective
review
of
medical
records
of
236
patients
with
hyperthyroidism
admitted
in
our
department
(
in-
or
out
-
patients
)
from
1986
to
1992
.

RESULTS
:

Four
patients
(
1.7
%
)
were
identified
with
toxic
hepatitis
which
could
reasonably
be
attributed
to
the
use
of
antithyroid
agent
.

Two
patients
had
a
cholestatic
hepatitis
induced
by
carbimazole

(
N
omercazole
)
.

Two
others
had
a
mixed
(
cholestatic
and
cytolytic
)

hepatitis
following
carbimazole
.

One
of
the
latter
two
patients
further
experienced
a
cytolytic
hepatitis
which
appeared
after
Benzylthiouracil

(
Basd
ne
)
had
replaced
carbimazole
.

Biological
features
of
hepatitis
disappeared
in
all
cases
after
cessation
of
the
incriminated
drug
,
while
biliary
,
viral
and
immunological
searches
were
negative
.

Only
2
patients
of
our
retrospective
study
experienced
a
mild
or
severe
neutropenia
.

CONCLUSION
:

Toxic
hepatitis
is
a
potential
adverse
effect
of
antithyroid
drugs
which
warrants
,
as
for
haematological
disturbances
,
a
pre
-
therapeutic
determination
and
a
careful
follow
-
up
of
relevant
biological
markers
.

Moreover
,
hepatotoxicity
may
not
be
restricted
to
one
class
of
antithyroid
agents
.

Study
of
the
role
of
vitamin
B12
and
folinic
acid
supplementation
in
preventing
hematologic
toxicity
of
zidovudine
.

A
prospective
,
randomized
study
was
conducted
to
evaluate
the
role
of
vitamin
B12
and
folinic
acid
supplementation
in
preventing
zidovudine

(
ZDV
)
-induced

bone
marrow
suppression
.

Seventy
-
five

human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV)-infected
patients
with
CD4
+
cell
counts
500/mm3
were
randomized
to
receive
either
ZDV

(
500
mg
daily
)
alone

(
group
I
,
n
=
38
)
or
in
combination
with
folinic
acid

(
15
mg
daily
)
and
intramascular
vitamin
B12

(
1000
micrograms
monthly
)

(
group
II
,
n
=
37
)
.

Finally
,
15
patients
were
excluded
from
the
study
(
noncompliance
14
,
death
1
)
;
thus
,
60
patients
(
31
in
group
I
and
29
in
group
II
)
were
eligible
for
analysis
.

No
significant
differences
between
groups
were
found
at
enrollment
.

During
the
study
,
vitamin
B12
and
folate
levels
were
significantly
higher
in
group
II
patients
;
however
,
no
differences
in
hemoglobin
,
hematocrit
,
mean
corpuscular
volume
,
and
white
-
cell
,
neutrophil
and
platelet
counts
were
observed
between
groups
at
3
,
6
,
9
and
12
months
.

Severe
hematologic
toxicity

(
neutrophil
count
1000/mm3
and/or
hemoglobin
8
g
/
dl
)
occurred
in
4
patients
assigned
to
group
I
and
7
assigned
to
group
II
.

There
was
no
correlation
between
vitamin
B12
or
folate
levels
and
development
of
myelosuppression
.

Vitamin
B12
and
folinic
acid
supplementation
of

ZDV
therapy
does
not
seem
useful
in
preventing
or
reducing

ZDV
-induced

myelotoxicity
in
the
overall
treated
population
,
although
a
beneficial
effect
in
certain
subgroups
of
patients
can
not
be
excluded
.

Acute
confusion
induced
by
a
high
-
dose
infusion
of
5-fluorouracil
and
folinic
acid
.

A
61-year
-
old
man
was
treated
with
combination
chemotherapy
incorporating
cisplatinum
,
etoposide
,
high
-
dose
5-fluorouracil
(
2,250
mg
/
m2/24
hours
)
and
folinic
acid
for
an
inoperable
gastric
adenocarcinoma
.

He
developed
acute
neurologic
symptoms
of
mental
confusion
,
disorientation
and
irritability
,
and
then
lapsed
into
a
deep
coma
,
lasting
for
approximately
40
hours
during
the
first
dose
(
day
2
)
of
5-fluorouracil
and
folinic
acid
infusion
.

This
complication
reappeared
on
day
25
during
the
second
dose
of
5-fluorouracil
and
folinic
acid
,
which
were
then
the
only
drugs
given
.

Because
folinic
acid
was
unlikely
to
be
associated
with
this
condition
,

neurotoxicity
due
to
high
-
dose
5-fluorouracil
was
highly
suspected
.

The
pathogenesis
of
5-fluorouracil

neurotoxicity
may
be
due
to
a
Krebs
cycle
blockade
by
fluoroacetate
and
fluorocitrate
,
thiamine
deficiency
,
or
dihydrouracil
dehydrogenase
deficiency
.

High
-
dose
5-fluorouracil
/
folinic
acid

infusion
therapy
has
recently
become
a
popular
regimen
for
various
cancers
.

It
is
necessary
that
both
oncologists
and
neurologists
be
fully
aware
of
this
unusual
complication
.

Effect
of
switching
carbamazepine
to
oxcarbazepine
on
the
plasma
levels
of
neuroleptics
.

A
case
report
.

Carbamazepine
was
switched
to
its
10-keto
analogue
oxcarbazepine
among
six
difficult
-
to
-
treat
schizophrenic
or
organic
psychotic
patients
using
concomitantly
haloperidol
,
chlorpromazine
or
clozapine
.

This
change
resulted
within
2
-
4
weeks
in
the
50
-
200
%
increase
in
the
plasma
levels
of
these
neuroleptics
and
the
appearance
of
extrapyramidal
symptoms
.

None
of
the
patients
showed
any
clinical
deteriotation
during
the
following
3
-
6
months
.

The
results
of
this
case
report
support
the
idea
that
in
contrast
with
carbamazepine
oxcarbazepine
does
not
induce
the
hepatic
microsomal
enzyme
systems
regulating
the
inactivation
of
antipsychotic
drugs
.

Erythema
multiforme
and
hypersensitivity
myocarditis
caused
by
ampicillin
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
erythema
multiforme
and
hypersensitivity
myocarditis
caused
by
ampicillin
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
13-year
-
old
boy
was
treated
with
ampicillin
and
gentamicin
because
of
suspected
septicemia
.

Medications
were
discontinued
when
erythema
multiforme
and
congestive
heart
failure
caused
by
myocarditis
occurred
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
methylprednisolone
and
gradually
improved
.

Macrophage
-
migration
inhibition
(
MIF
)
test
with
ampicillin
was
positive
.

DISCUSSION
:

After
most
infections
causing
erythema
multiforme
and
myocarditis
were
ruled
out
,
a
drug
-
induced
allergic
reaction
was
suspected
.

Positive
MIF
test
for
ampicillin
showed
sensitization
of
the
patient
's
lymphocytes
to
ampicillin
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Hypersensitivity
myocarditis
is
a
rare
and
dangerous
manifestation
of
allergy
to
penicillins
.

Immediate
allergic
reactions
to
amoxicillin
.

A
large
group
of
patients
with
suspected
allergic
reactions
to
beta
-
lactam
antibiotics
was
evaluated
.

A
detailed
clinical
history
,
together
with
skin
tests
,
RAST
(
radioallergosorbent
test
)
,
and
controlled
challenge
tests
,
was
used
to
establish
whether
patients
allergic
to
beta
-
lactam
antibiotics
had
selective
immediate
allergic
responses
to
amoxicillin

(
AX
)
or
were
cross
-
reacting
with
other
penicillin
derivatives
.

Skin
tests
were
performed
with
benzylpenicilloyl
-
poly
-
L
-
lysine

(
BPO
-
PLL
)
,
benzylpenicilloate
,
benzylpenicillin

(
PG
)
,
ampicillin

(
AMP
)
,
and
AX
.

RAST
for
BPO
-
PLL
and
AX

-PLL
was
done
.

When
both
skin
test
and
RAST
for
BPO
were
negative
,
single
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
challenge
tests
were
done
to
ensure
tolerance
of
PG
or
sensitivity
to
AX
.

A
total
of
177
patients
were
diagnosed
as
allergic
to
beta
-
lactam
antibiotics
.

We
selected
the
54
(
30.5
%
)
cases
of
immediate
AX

allergy
with
good
tolerance
of
PG
.

Anaphylaxis
was
seen
in
37
patients
(
69
%
)
,
the
other
17
(
31
%
)
having
urticaria
and/or
angioedema
.

All
the
patients
were
skin
test
negative
to
BPO
;
49
of
51
(
96
%
)
were
also
negative
to
MDM
,
and
44
of
46
(
96
%
)
to
PG
.

Skin
tests
with
AX
were
positive
in
34
(
63
%
)
patients
.

RAST
was
positive
for
AX
in
22
patients
(
41
%
)
and
to
BPO
in
just
5
(
9
%
)
.

None
of
the
sera
with
negative
RAST
for
AX
were
positive
to
BPO
.

Challenge
tests
with
AX
were
performed
in
23
subjects
(
43
%
)
to
establish
the
diagnosis
of
immediate
allergic
reaction
to
AX
,
and
in
15
cases
(
28
%
)
both
skin
test
and
RAST
for
AX
were
negative
.

PG
was
well
tolerated
by
all
54
patients
.

We
describe
the
largest
group
of
AX
-
allergic
patients
who
have
tolerated
PG
reported
so
far
.

Diagnosis
of
these
patients
can
be
achieved
only
if
specific
AX

-related
reagents
are
employed
.

Further
studies
are
necessary
to
determine
the
exact
extent
of
this
problem
and
to
improve
the
efficacy
of
diagnostic
methods
.

Persistent
paralysis
after
prolonged
use
of
atracurium
in
the
absence
of
corticosteroids
.

Neuromuscular
blocking
agents
(
NMBAs
)
are
often
used
for
patients
requiring
prolonged
mechanical
ventilation
.

Reports
of
persistent
paralysis
after
the
discontinuance
of
these
drugs
have
most
often
involved
aminosteroid
-
based
NMBAs
such
as
vecuronium
bromide
,
especially
when
used
in
conjunction
with
corticosteroids
.

Atracurium
besylate
,
a
short
-
acting

benzylisoquinolinium

NMBA
that
is
eliminated
independently
of
renal
or
hepatic
function
,
has
also
been
associated
with
persistent
paralysis
,
but
only
when
used
with
corticosteroids
.

We
report
a
case
of
atracurium
-related
paralysis
persisting
for
approximately
50
hours
in
a
patient
who
was
not
treated
with
corticosteroids
.

Habitual
use
of
acetaminophen
as
a
risk
factor
for
chronic
renal
failure
:
a
comparison
with
phenacetin
.

Six
epidemiologic
studies
in
the
United
States
and
Europe
indicate
that
habitual
use
of
phenacetin
is
associated
with
the
development
of
chronic
renal
failure
and
end
-
stage
renal
disease

(
ESRD
)
,
with
a
relative
risk
in
the
range
of
4
to
19
.

As
a
result
of
these
and
other
studies
,
phenacetin
has
now
been
withdrawn
from
the
market
in
most
countries
.

However
,
three
case
control
studies
,
one
each
in
North
Carolina
,
northern
Maryland
,
and
West
Berlin
,
Germany
,
showed
that
habitual
use
of
acetaminophen
is
also
associated
with
chronic
renal
failure
and
ESRD
,
with
a
relative
risk
in
the
range
of
2
to
4
.

These
studies
suggest
that
both
phenacetin
and
acetaminophen
may
contribute
to
the
burden
of
ESRD
,
with
the
risk
of
the
latter
being
somewhat
less
than
that
of
the
former
.

This
apparent
difference
in
risk
may
not
be
due
to
differences
in
nephrotoxic
potential
of
the
drugs
themselves
.

A
lower
relative
risk
would
be
expected
for
acetaminophen

if
the
risk
of
both
drugs
in
combination
with
other
analgesics
was
higher
than
the
risk
of
either
agent
alone
.

Thus
,
acetaminophen
has
been
used
both
as
a
single
agent
and
in
combination
with
other
analgesics
,
whereas
phenacetin
was
available
only
in
combinations
.

The
possibility
that
habitual
use
of
acetaminophen
alone
increases
the
risk
of
ESRD
has
not
been
clearly
demonstrated
,
but
can
not
be
dismissed
.

Reduction
of
heparan
sulphate

-associated
anionic
sites
in
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
of
rats
with
streptozotocin

-induced
diabetic
nephropathy
.

Heparan
sulphate
-associated
anionic
sites
in
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
were
studied
in
rats
8
months
after
induction
of
diabetes
by
streptozotocin
and
in
age-
adn
sex
-
matched
control
rats
,
employing
the
cationic
dye
cuprolinic
blue
.

Morphometric
analysis
at
the
ultrastructural
level
was
performed
using
a
computerized
image
processor
.

The
heparan
sulphate
specificity
of
the
cuprolinic
blue
staining
was
demonstrated
by
glycosaminoglycan

-degrading
enzymes
,
showing
that
pretreatment
of
the
sections
with
heparitinase
abolished
all
staining
,
whereas
chondroitinase
ABC
had
no
effect
.

The
majority
of
anionic
sites
(
74
%
in
diabetic
and
81
%
in
control
rats
)
were
found
within
the
lamina
rara
externa
of
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
.

A
minority
of
anionic
sites
were
scattered
throughout
the
lamina
densa
and
lamina
rara
interna
,
and
were
significantly
smaller
than
those
in
the
lamina
rara
externa
of
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
(
p<0.001
and
p<0.01
for
diabetic
and
control
rats
,
respectively
)
.

Diabetic
rats
progressively
developed

albuminuria
reaching
40.3
(
32.2
-
62.0
)

mg/24
h
after
8
months
in
contrast
to
the
control
animals
(
0.8
(
0.2
-
0.9
)

mg/24

h
,
p<0.002
)
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
number
of
heparan
sulphate
anionic
sites
and
the
total
anionic
site
surface
(
number
of
anionic
sites
x
mean
anionic
site
surface
)
in
the
lamina
rara
externa
of
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
was
reduced
by
19
%
(
p<0.021
)
and
by
26
%
(
p<0.02
)
,
respectively
.

Number
and
total
anionic
site
surface
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
(
lamina
densa
and
lamina
rara
interna
)
were
not
significantly
changed
.

We
conclude
that
in
streptozotocin
-
diabetic
rats
with
an
increased
urinary
albumin
excretion
,

a
reduced
heparan
sulphate
charge
barrier
/
density
is
found
at
the
lamina
rara
externa
of
the
glomerular
basement
membrane
.

Effect
of
some
anticancer
drugs
and
combined
chemotherapy
on
renal
toxicity
.

The
nephrotoxic
action
of
anticancer
drugs
such
as
nitrogranulogen

(
NG
)
,
methotrexate

(
MTX
)
,
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
and
cyclophosphamide

(
CY
)
administered
alone
or
in
combination
[
MTX
+
5-FU
+
CY
(
CMF
)
]
was
evaluated
in
experiments
on
Wistar
rats
.

After
drug
administration
,
creatinine
concentrations
in
the
plasma
and
in
the
urine
of
the
rats
were
determined
,
as
well
as
creatinine
clearance
.

Histopathologic
evaluation
of
the
kidneys
was
also
performed
.

After
MTX
administration
a
significant
increase
(
p
=
0.0228
)
in
the
plasma
creatinine
concentration
and
a
significant
(
p
=
0.0001
)
decrease
in
creatinine
clearance
was
noted
compared
to
controls
.

After
the
administration
of
NG
,

5-FU
and
CY
neither
a
statistically
significant
increase
in
creatinine
concentration
nor
an
increase
in
creatinine
clearance
was
observed
compared
to
the
group
receiving
no
cytostatics
.

Following
polytherapy
according
to
the
CMF
regimen
,
a
statistically
significant
decrease
(
p
=
0.0343
)
in
creatinine
clearance
was
found
,
but
creatinine
concentration
did
not
increase
significantly
compared
to
controls
.

CY
caused
hemorrhagic
cystitis
in
40
%
of
rats
,
but
it
did
not
cause
this
complication
when
combined
with
5-FU
and
MTX
.

Histologic
changes
were
found
in
rat
kidneys
after
administration
of
MTX
,
CY
and
NG
,
while
no
such
change
was
observed
after
5-FU
and
joint
administration
of
MTX
+
5-FU
+
CY
compared
to
controls
.

Our
studies
indicate
that
nephrotoxicity
of
MTX
+
5-FU
+
CY
administered
jointly
is
lower
than
in
monotherapy
.

Lithium
-associated
cognitive
and
functional
deficits
reduced
by
a
switch
to
divalproex
sodium
:
a
case
series
.

BACKGROUND
:

Lithium
remains
a
first
-
line
treatment
for
the
acute
and
maintenance
treatment
of
bipolar
disorder
.

Although
much
has
been
written
about
the
management
of
the
more
common
adverse
effects
of
lithium
,
such
as
polyuria
and
tremor
,
more
subtle
lithium
side
effects
such
as
cognitive
deficits
,
loss
of
creativity
,
and
functional
impairments
remain
understudied
.

This
report
summarizes
our
experience
in
switching
bipolar
patients
from
lithium
to
divalproex
sodium
to
alleviate
such
cognitive
and
functional
impairments
.

METHOD
:

Open
,
case
series
design
.

RESULTS
:

We
report
seven
cases
where
substitution
of
lithium
,
either
fully
or
partially
,
with
divalproex
sodium
was
extremely
helpful
in
reducing
the
cognitive
,
motivational
,
or
creative
deficits
attributed
to
lithium
in
our
bipolar
patients
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
this
preliminary
report
,
divalproex
sodium
was
a
superior
alternative
to
lithium
in
bipolar
patients
experiencing
cognitive
deficits
,
loss
of
creativity
,
and
functional
impairments
.

toxicity
.

For
previously
treated
advanced
breast
cancer
,
there
is
no
standard
second
-
line
therapy
.

Combination
chemotherapy
with

mitoxantrone
,
high
-
dose
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
and
leucovorin

(
MFL
regimen
)
had
been
reported
as
an
effective
and
well
tolerated
regimen
.

From
October
1993
to
November
1995
,
we
treated
13
patients
with
previously
chemotherapy
-
treated
metastatic
breast
cancer
by
mitoxantrone
,
12
mg
/
m2
,
on
day
1
and
continuous
infusion
of
5-FU
,
3000
mg
/
m2
,
together
with
leucovorin
,
300
mg
/
m2
,
for
48
h
from
day
1
to
2
.

Each
course
of
chemotherapy
was
given
every
4
weeks
.

Most
of
these
patients
had
more
than
two
metastatic
sites
,
with
lung
metastasis
predominant
.

Seven
patients
had
been
treated
with
anthracycline
.

Seven
patients
had
previously
received
radiotherapy
and
seven
had
received
hormone
therapy
.

Median
number
of
courses
of
MFL
regimen
given
was
six
and
the
median
cumulative
dose
of

mitoxantrone
was
68.35
mg
/
m2
.

One
patient
had
complete
response
,
seven
had
stable
disease
,
none
had
partial
response
and
five
had
progressive
disease
.

The
overall
objective
response
rate
was
7.6
%
.

The
median
follow
-
up
period
was
14
months
.

Median
survival
was
16
months
.

Median
progression
-
free
survival
was
5
months
.

A
complete
responder
had
relapse
-
free
survival
up
to
17
months
.

Major
toxicities
were
cardiotoxicity
and
leukopenia
.

Eight
patients
were
dead
in
the
last
follow
-
up
;
two
of
them
died
of
treatment
-
related
toxicity
.

The
MFL
regimen
achieves
little
palliative
benefit
and
induces
severe
toxicity
at
a
fairly
high
rate
.

Administration
of
this
regimen
to
breast
cancer
patients
who
have
been
treated
by
chemotherapy
and
those
with
impaired
heart
function
requires
careful
attention
.

Upregulation
of
the
expression
of
vasopressin
gene
in
the
paraventricular
and
supraoptic
nuclei
of
the
lithium
-induced
diabetes
insipidus
rat
.

The
expression
of
arginine
vasopressin

(
AVP
)
gene
in
the
paraventricular
(
PVN
)
and
supraoptic
nuclei
(
SON
)
was
investigated
in
rats
with
lithium

(
Li
)
-induced
polyuria
,
using
in
situ
hybridization
histochemistry
and
radioimmunoassay
.

The
male
Wistar
rats
consuming
a
diet
that
contained
LiCl
(
60
mmol
/
kg
)
for
4
weeks
developed
marked

polyuria
.

The
Li
-treated
rats
produced
a
large
volume
of
hypotonic
urine
with
low
ionic
concentrations
.

Plasma
sodium
concentrations
were
found
to
be
slightly
increased
in
the
Li
-treated
rats
compared
with
those
in
controls
.

Plasma
concentration
of
AVP
and
transcripts
of
AVP
gene
in
the
PVN
and
SON
were
significantly
increased
in
the
Li
-treated
rats
compared
with
controls
.

These
results
suggest
that
dehydration
and/or
the
activation
of
visceral
afferent
inputs
may
contribute
to
the
elevation
of
plasma
AVP
and
the
upregulation
of
AVP

gene
expression
in
the
PVN
and
the
SON
of
the
Li
-induced

diabetes
insipidus
rat
.

Suxamethonium
-induced
cardiac
arrest
and
death
following
5
days
of
immobilization
.

The
present
report
describes
a
case
of
cardiac
arrest
and
subsequent
death
as
a
result
of
hyperkalaemia
following
the
use
of
suxamethonium
in
a
23-year
-
old
Malawian
woman
.

Five
days
after
the
onset
of
the
symptoms
of
meningitis
,
the
patient
aspirated
stomach
contents
and
needed
endotracheal
intubation
.

Forty
seconds
after
injection
of
suxamethonium
,
bradycardia
and
cardiac
arrest
occurred
.

Attempts
to
resuscitate
the
patient
were
not
successful
.

The
serum
level
of
potassium
was
observed
to
be
8.4
mequiv
L-1
.

Apart
from
the
reduction
in
the
patient
's
level
of
consciousness
,
there
were
no
signs
of
motor
neurone
damage
or
of
any
of
the
other
known
predisposing
conditions
for
hyperkalaemia
following
the
administration
of
suxamethonium
.

It
is
postulated
that
her
death
was
caused
by
hypersensitivity
to
suxamethonium
,
associated
with
her
5-day
immobilization
.

An
unusual
toxic
reaction
to
axillary
block
by
mepivacaine
with
adrenaline
.

An
increase
in
blood
pressure
,
accompanied
by
atrial
fibrillation
,
agitation
,

incomprehensible
shouts
and
loss
of
consciousness
,
was
observed
in
an
elderly
,
ASA
classification
group
II
,
cardiovascularly
medicated
male
,
12
min
after
performance
of
axillary
block
with
mepivacaine
850
mg
containing
adrenaline
0.225
mg
,
for
correction
of
Dupuytren
's
contracture
.

After
intravenous
administration
of
labetalol
,

metoprolol
and
midazolam
the
patient
's
condition
improved
,
and
15
min
later
he
woke
up
.

The
block
was
successful
and
surgery
was
conducted
as
scheduled
despite
persisting
atrial
fibrillation
.

Postoperatively
,
the
patient
refused
DC
cardioversion
and
was
treated
medically
.

Both
the
temporal
relationship
of
events
and
the
response
to
treatment
suggest
that
a
rapid
systemic
absorption
of
mepivacaine
with
adrenaline
and/or
interaction
of
these
drugs
with
the
patient
's
cardiovascular
medications
were
responsible
for
the
perioperative
complications
.

Clinical
and
histopathologic
examination
of
renal
allografts
treated
with
tacrolimus

(
FK506
)
for
at
least
one
year
.

BACKGROUND
:

We
clinically
and
pathologically
analyzed
renal
allografts
from
1
9
renal
transplant
patients
treated
with
tacrolimus

(
FK506
)
for
more
than
1
year
.

METHODS
:

Twenty
-
six
renal
allograft
biopsy
specimens
from
1
9
renal
transplant
patients
who
underwent
transplantations
between
1991
and
1993
were
evaluated
.

Thirteen
biopsies
were
performed
from
stable
functioning
renal
allografts
with
informed
consent
(
nonepisode
biopsy
)
and
the
other
13
were
from
dysfunctional
renal
allografts
with
a
clinical
indication
for
biopsy
(
episode
biopsy
)
.

RESULTS
:

The
main
pathologic
diagnoses
(
some
overlap
)
were
acute
rejection
(
AR
;
n
=
4
)
,
chronic
rejection
(
CR
;
n=5
)
,
AR+CR
(
n
=
4
)
,
recurrent
IgA
nephropathy

(
n
=
5
)
,
normal
findings
(
n
=
2
)
,
minimal
-
type
chronic
FK506
nephropathy

(
n
=
9
)
,
and
mild
-
type
FK506

nephropathy
(
n
=
11
)
.

Of
the
nonepisode
biopsies
,
7
and
4
biopsies
showed
minimal
-
type
and
mild
-
type
chronic
FK506
nephropathy
,
respectively
.

Chronic
FK506

nephropathy
consisted
of
rough
and
foamy
tubular
vacuolization
(
5
biopsies
)
,
arteriolopathy
(
angiodegeneration
of
the
arteriolar
wall
;
20
biopsies
)
,
focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
(
4
biopsies
)
and
the
striped
form
of
interstitial
fibrosis

(
11
biopsies
)
.

The
serum
creatinine
levels
of
patients
in
the
mild
-
type
chronic
FK506
nephropathy
group
,
which
included
7
episode
biopsies
,
were
statistically
higher
than
those
in
the
minimum
-
type
chronic
FK506
-
nephropathy
group
(
P
0.001
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
study
demonstrates
that
chronic
FK506

nephropathy
consists
primarily
of
arteriolopathy
manifesting
as
insudative
hyalinosis
of
the
arteriolar
wall
,
and
suggests
that
mild
-
type
chronic
FK506
nephropathy
is
a
condition
which
may
lead
to
deterioration
of
renal
allograft
function
.

Memory
facilitation
and
stimulation
of
endogenous
nerve
growth
factor
synthesis
by
the
acetylcholine
releaser
PG-9
.

The
effects
of
PG-9

(
3alpha
-
tropyl
2-(p
-
bromophenyl)propionate
)
,
the
acetylcholine
releaser
,
on
memory
processes
and
nerve
growth
factor

(
NGF
)
synthesis
were
evaluated
.

In
the
mouse
passive
-
avoidance
test
,
PG-9
(
10
-
30
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
,
administered
20
min
before
the
training
session
,
prevented
amnesia

induced
by
both
the
non
selective
antimuscarinic
drug
scopolamine
and
the
M1-selective
antagonist
S-(-)-ET-126
.

In
the
same
experimental
conditions
,
PG-9
(
5
-
20
microg
per
mouse
,
i.c.v
.
)
was
also
able
to
prevent
antimuscarine
-
induced
amnesia
,
demonstrating
a
central
localization
of
the
activity
.

At
the
highest
effective
doses
,
PG-9
did
not
produce
any
collateral
symptoms
as
revealed
by
the
Irwin
test
,
and
it
did
not
modify
spontaneous
motility
and
inspection
activity
,
as
revealed
by
the
hole
-
board
test
.

PG-9
was
also
able
to
increase
the
amount
of
NGF
secreted
in
vitro
by
astrocytes
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

The
maximal
NGF
contents
obtained
by
PG-9
were
17.6-fold
of
the
control
value
.

During
culture
,
no
morphological
changes
were
found
at
effective
concentrations
of
PG-9
.

The
current
work
indicates
the
ability
of
PG-9
to
induce
beneficial
effects
on
cognitive
processes
and
stimulate
activity
of
NGF
synthesis
in
astroglial
cells
.

Therefore
,
PG-9
could
represent
a
potential
useful
drug
able
to
improve
the
function
of
impaired
cognitive
processes
.

Angioedema
due
to
ACE
inhibitors
:
common
and
inadequately
diagnosed
.

The
estimated
incidence
of
angioedema
during
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitor
treatment
is
between
1
and
7
per
thousand
patients
.

This
potentially
serious
adverse
effect
is
often
preceded
by
minor
manifestations
that
may
serve
as
a
warning
.

Recurarization
in
the
recovery
room
.

A
case
of
recurarization
in
the
recovery
room
is
reported
.

Accumulation
of
atracurium
in
the
intravenous
line
led
to
recurarization
after
flushing
the
line
in
the
recovery
room
.

A
respiratory
arrest
with
severe
desaturation
and
bradycardia
occurred
.

Circumstances
leading
to
this
event
and
the
mechanisms
enabling
a
neuromuscular
blockade
to
occur
,
following
the
administration
of
a
small
dose
of
relaxant
,
are
discussed
.

Recurrent
use
of
newer
oral
contraceptives
and
the
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
.

The
epidemiological
studies
that
assessed
the
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism

(
VTE
)
associated
with
newer
oral
contraceptives

(
OC
)
did
not
distinguish
between
patterns
of
OC
use
,
namely
first
-
time
users
,
repeaters
and
switchers
.

Data
from
a
Transnational
case
-
control
study
were
used
to
assess
the
risk
of
VTE
for
the
latter
patterns
of
use
,
while
accounting
for
duration
of
use
.

Over
the
period
1993
-
1996
,
551
cases
of
VTE
were
identified
in
Germany
and
the
UK
along
with
2066
controls
.

Totals
of
128
cases
and
650
controls
were
analysed
for
repeat
use
and
135
cases
and
622
controls
for
switching
patterns
.

The
adjusted
rate
ratio
of
VTE
for
repeat
users
of
third
generation
OC
was
0.6
(
95
%
CI:0.3
-
1.2
)
relative
to
repeat
users
of
second
generation
pills
,
whereas
it
was
1.3
(
95
%
CI:0.7
-
2.4
)
for
switchers
from
second
to
third
generation
pills
relative
to
switchers
from
third
to
second
generation
pills
.

We
conclude
that
second
and
third
generation
agents
are
associated
with
equivalent
risks
of
VTE
when
the
same
agent
is
used
repeatedly
after
interruption
periods
or
when
users
are
switched
between
the
two
generations
of
pills
.

These
analyses
suggest
that
the
higher
risk
observed
for
the
newer
OC
in
other
studies
may
be
the
result
of
inadequate
comparisons
of
pill
users
with
different
patterns
of
pill
use
.

Development
of
apomorphine

-induced

aggressive
behavior
:
comparison
of
adult
male
and
female
Wistar
rats
.

The
development
of
apomorphine
-induced
(
1.0
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
once
daily
)

aggressive
behavior
of
adult
male
and
female
Wistar
rats
obtained
from
the
same
breeder
was
studied
in
two
consecutive
sets
.

In
male
animals
,
repeated
apomorphine
treatment
induced
a
gradual
development
of
aggressive
behavior
as
evidenced
by
the
increased
intensity
of
aggressiveness
and
shortened
latency
before
the
first
attack
toward
the
opponent
.

In
female
rats
,
only
a
weak
tendency
toward
aggressiveness
was
found
.

In
conclusion
,
the
present
study
demonstrates
gender
differences
in
the
development
of
the
apomorphine
-induced

aggressive
behavior
and
indicates
that
the
female
rats
do
not
fill
the
validation
criteria
for
use
in
this
method
.

Serotonergic
antidepressants
and
urinary
incontinence
.

Many
new
serotonergic
antidepressants
have
been
introduced
over
the
past
decade
.

Although
urinary
incontinence
is
listed
as
one
side
effect
of
these
drugs
in
their
package
inserts
there
is
only
one
report
in
the
literature
.

This
concerns
2
male
patients
who
experienced
incontinence
while
taking
venlafaxine
.

In
the
present
paper
the
authors
describe
2
female
patients
who
developed
incontinence
secondary
to
the
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
paroxetine
and
sertraline
,
as
well
as
a
third
who
developed
this
side
effect
on
venlafaxine
.

In
2
of
the
3
cases
the
patients
were
also
taking
lithium
carbonate
and
beta
-
blockers
,
both
of
which
could
have
contributed
to
the
incontinence
.

Animal
studies
suggest
that
incontinence
secondary
to
serotonergic
antidepressants
could
be
mediated
by
the
5HT4
receptors
found
on
the
bladder
.

Further
research
is
needed
to
delineate
the
frequency
of
this
troubling
side
effect
and
how
best
to
treat
it
.

Hypotension
following
the
initiation
of
tizanidine
in
a
patient
treated
with
an
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
inhibitor
for
chronic
hypertension
.

Centrally
acting
alpha-2
adrenergic
agonists
are
one
of
several
pharmacologic
agents
used
in
the
treatment
of
spasticity
related
to
disorders
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

In
addition
to
their
effects
on
spasticity
,
certain
adverse
cardiorespiratory
effects
have
been
reported
.

Adults
chronically
treated
with
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
inhibitors
may
have
a
limited
ability
to
respond
to
hypotension
when
the
sympathetic
response
is
simultaneously
blocked
.

The
authors
present
a
10-year
-
old
boy
chronically
treated
with
lisinopril
,
an
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
inhibitor
,
to
control
hypertension
who
developed
hypotension
following
the
addition
of
tizanidine
,
an
alpha-2
agonist
,
for
the
treatment
of
spasticity
.

The
possible
interaction
of
tizanidine
and
other
antihypertensive
agents
should
be
kept
in
mind
when
prescribing
therapy
to
treat
either
hypertension
or
spasticity
in
such
patients
.

Peritubular
capillary
basement
membrane
reduplication
in
allografts
and
native
kidney
disease
:
a
clinicopathologic
study
of
278
consecutive
renal
specimens
.

BACKGROUND
:

An
association
has
been
found
between
transplant
glomerulopathy

(
TG
)
and
reduplication
of
peritubular
capillary
basement
membranes
(
PTCR
)
.

Although
such
an
association
is
of
practical
and
theoretical
importance
,
only
one
prospective
study
has
tried
to
confirm
it
.

METHODS
:

We
examined
278
consecutive
renal
specimens
(
from
135
transplants
and
143
native
kidneys
)
for
ultrastructural
evidence
of
PTCR
.

In
addition
to
renal
allografts
with
TG
,
we
also
examined
grafts
with
acute
rejection
,
recurrent
glomerulonephritis
,
chronic
allograft
nephropathy
and
stable
grafts
(
"
protocol
biopsies
"
)
.

Native
kidney
specimens
included
a
wide
range
of
glomerulopathies
as
well
as
cases
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
,
malignant
hypertension
,
acute
interstitial
nephritis
,
and
acute
tubular
necrosis
.

RESULTS
:

We
found
PTCR
in
14
of
15
cases
of
TG
,
in
7
transplant
biopsy
specimens
without
TG
,
and
in
13
of
143
native
kidney
biopsy
specimens
.

These
13
included
cases
of
malignant
hypertension
,
thrombotic
microangiopathy
,
lupus
nephritis
,
Henoch
-
Schonlein
nephritis
,
crescentic
glomerulonephritis
,
and
cocaine
-related
acute
renal
failure
.

Mild
PTCR
in
allografts
without
TG
did
not
predict
renal
failure
or
significant
proteinuria
after
follow
-
up
periods
of
between
3
months
and
1
year
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

We
conclude
that
in
transplants
,
there
is
a
strong
association
between
well

developed
PTCR
and
TG
,
while
the
significance
of
mild
PTCR
and
its
predictive
value
in
the
absence
of
TG
is
unclear
.

PTCR
also
occurs
in
certain
native
kidney
diseases
,
though
the
association
is
not
as
strong
as
that
for
TG
.

We
suggest
that
repeated
endothelial
injury
,
including
immunologic
injury
,
may
be
the
cause
of
this
lesion
both
in
allografts
and
native
kidneys
.

Conformationally
restricted
analogs
of
BD1008
and
an
antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide
targeting
sigma1
receptors
produce
anti-
cocaine
effects
in
mice
.

Cocaine
's
ability
to
interact
with
sigma
receptors
suggests
that
these
proteins
mediate
some
of
its
behavioral
effects
.

Therefore
,
three
novel
sigma
receptor
ligands
with
antagonist
activity
were
evaluated
in
Swiss
Webster
mice
:
BD1018

(
3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane
)
,
BD1063

(
1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine
)
,
and
LR132
(
1R,2S-(+)-cis
-
N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine
)
.

Competition
binding
assays
demonstrated
that
all
three
compounds
have
high
affinities
for
sigma1
receptors
.

The
three
compounds
vary
in
their
affinities
for
sigma2
receptors
and
exhibit
negligible
affinities
for
dopamine
,
opioid
,
GABA
(
A
)
and
NMDA
receptors
.

In
behavioral
studies
,
pre
-
treatment
of
mice
with
BD1018
,
BD1063
,
or
LR132
significantly
attenuated
cocaine
-induced
convulsions
and
lethality
.

Moreover
,
post
-
treatment
with
LR132
prevented
cocaine
-induced
lethality
in
a
significant
proportion
of
animals
.

In
contrast
to
the
protection
provided
by
the
putative
antagonists
,
the
well
-
characterized
sigma
receptor
agonist
di
-
o
-
tolylguanidine

(
DTG
)
and
the
novel
sigma
receptor
agonist
BD1031

(
3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane
)

each
worsened
the
behavioral
toxicity
of
cocaine
.

At
doses
where
alone
,
they
produced
no
significant
effects
on
locomotion
,
BD1018
,
BD1063
and
LR132
significantly
attenuated
the
locomotor
stimulatory
effects
of
cocaine
.

To
further
validate
the
hypothesis
that
the
anti-
cocaine
effects
of
the
novel
ligands
involved
antagonism
of
sigma
receptors
,
an
antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide
against
sigma1
receptors
was
also
shown
to
significantly
attenuate
the
convulsive
and
locomotor
stimulatory
effects
of
cocaine
.

Together
,
the
data
suggests
that
functional
antagonism
of
sigma
receptors
is
capable
of
attenuating
a
number
of
cocaine
-induced
behaviors
.

Torsades
de
pointes

(
TDP
)
is
a
potentially
fatal
ventricular
tachycardia
associated
with
increases
in
QT
interval
and
monophasic
action
potential
duration
(
MAPD
)
.

TDP
is
a
side
-
effect
that
has
led
to
withdrawal
of
several
drugs
from
the
market
(
e.g.
terfenadine
and
terodiline
)
.

2
.

The
potential
of
compounds
to
cause
TDP
was
evaluated
by
monitoring
their
effects
on
MAPD
in
dog
.

Four
compounds
known
to
increase
QT
interval
and
cause
TDP
were
investigated
:
terfenadine
,
terodiline
,
cisapride
and
E4031
.

On
the
basis
that
only
free
drug
in
the
systemic
circulation
will
elicit
a
pharmacological
response
target
,
free
concentrations
in
plasma
were
selected
to
mimic
the
free
drug
exposures
in
man
.

Infusion
regimens
were
designed
that
rapidly
achieved
and
maintained
target
-
free
concentrations
of
these
drugs
in
plasma
and
data
on
the
relationship
between
free
concentration
and
changes
in
MAPD
were
obtained
for
these
compounds
.

3
.

These
data
indicate
that
the
free
ED50
in
plasma
for
terfenadine

(
1.9
nM
)
,

terodiline
(
76
nM
)
,
cisapride

(
11
nM
)
and
E4031
(
1.9
nM
)
closely
correlate
with
the
free
concentration
in
man
causing
QT
effects
.

For
compounds
that
have
shown
TDP
in
the
clinic
(
terfenadine
,
terodiline
,
cisapride
)
there
is
little
differentiation
between
the
dog
ED50
and
the
efficacious
free
plasma
concentrations
in
man
(
10-fold
)
reflecting
their
limited
safety
margins
.

These
data
underline
the
need
to
maximize
the
therapeutic
ratio
with
respect
to
TDP
in
potential
development
candidates
and
the
importance
of
using
free
drug
concentrations
in

Fatal
myeloencephalopathy
due
to
accidental
intrathecal

vincristin
administration
:
a
report
of
two
cases
.

We
report
on
two
fatal
cases
of
accidental
intrathecal
vincristine
instillation
in
a
5-year
old
girl
with
recurrent
acute
lymphoblastic
leucemia
and
a
57-year
old
man
with
lymphoblastic
lymphoma
.

The
girl
died
seven
days
,
the
man
four
weeks
after
intrathecal
injection
of
vincristine
.

Clinically
,
the
onset
was
characterized
by
the
signs
of
opistothonus
,
sensory
and
motor
dysfunction
and
ascending
paralysis
.

Histological
and
immunohistochemical
investigations
(

)
revealed
degeneration
of
myelin
and

as
well
as
pseudocystic
transformation
in
areas
exposed
to
vincristine
,
accompanied
by
secondary
changes

Intravenous
administration
of
prochlorperazine
by
15-minute
infusion
versus
2-minute
bolus
does
not
affect
the
incidence
of
akathisia
:
a
prospective
,
randomized
,
controlled
trial
.

STUDY
OBJECTIVE
:

We
sought
to
compare
the
rate
of
akathisia
after
administration
of
intravenous
prochlorperazine
as
a
2-minute
bolus
or
15-minute
infusion
.

METHODS
:
We
conducted
a
prospective
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
study
in
the
emergency
department
of
a
central
-
city
teaching
hospital
.

Patients
aged
18
years
or
older
treated
with
prochlorperazine
for
headache
,
nausea
,
or
vomiting
were
eligible
for
inclusion
.

Study
participants
were
randomized
to
receive
10
mg
of
prochlorperazine
administered
intravenously
by
means
of
2-minute
push
(
bolus
group
)
or
10
mg
diluted
in
50
mL
of
normal
saline
solution
administered
by
means
of
intravenous
infusion
during
a
15-minute
period
(
infusion
group
)
.

The
main
outcome
was
the
number
of
study
participants
experiencing
akathisia
within
60
minutes
of
administration
.

Akathisia
was
defined
as
either
a
spontaneous
report
of
restlessness
or
agitation
or
a
change
of
2
or
more
in
the
patient
-
reported
akathisia
rating
scale
and
a
change
of
at
least
1
in
the
investigator
-
observed
akathisia
rating
scale
.

The
intensity
of
headache
and
nausea
was
measured
with
a
100-mm
visual
analog
scale
.

RESULTS
:

One
hundred
patients
were
enrolled
.

One
study
participant
was
excluded
after
protocol
violation
.

Seventy
-
three
percent
(
73/99
)
of
the
study
participants
were
treated
for
headache
and
70
%
(
70/99
)
for
nausea
.

In
the
bolus
group
,
26.0
%
(
13/50
)
had
akathisia
compared
with
32.7
%
(
16/49
)
in
the
infusion
group

(
Delta=-6.7
%
;
95
%
confidence
interval
[
CI
]
-24.6
%
to
11.2
%
)
.

The
difference
between
the
bolus
and
infusion
groups
in
the
percentage
of
participants
who
saw
a
50
%
reduction
in
their
headache
intensity
within
30
minutes
was
11.8
%
(
95
%
CI
-9.6

%
to
33.3
%
)
.

The
difference
in
the
percentage
of
patients
with
a
50
%
reduction
in
their
nausea
was
12.6
%
(
95
%
CI
-4.6
%
to
29.8
%
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

A
50
%
reduction
in
the
incidence
of
akathisia
when
prochlorperazine
was
administered
by
means
of
15-minute
intravenous
infusion
versus
a
2-minute
intravenous
push
was
not
detected
.

The
efficacy
of
prochlorperazine
in
the
treatment
of
headache
and
nausea
likewise
did
not
appear
to
be
affected
by
the
rate
of
administration
,
although
no
formal
statistical
comparisons
were
made
.

The
relationship
between
hippocampal
acetylcholine
release
and
cholinergic
convulsant
sensitivity
in
withdrawal
seizure
-prone
and
withdrawal
seizure

-resistant
selected
mouse
lines
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
septo
-
hippocampal
cholinergic
pathway
has
been
implicated
in
epileptogenesis
,
and
genetic
factors
influence
the
response
to
cholinergic
agents
,
but
limited
data
are
available
on
cholinergic
involvement
in
alcohol
withdrawal
severity
.

Thus
,
the
relationship
between
cholinergic
activity
and
responsiveness
and
alcohol
withdrawal
was
investigated
in
a
genetic
animal
model
of
ethanol
withdrawal
severity
.

METHODS
:

Cholinergic
convulsant
sensitivity
was
examined
in
alcohol
-na

ve

Withdrawal
Seizure
-Prone
(
WSP
)
and
-
Resistant
(
WSR
)
mice
.

Animals
were
administered

nicotine
,
carbachol
,
or
neostigmine
via
timed
tail
vein
infusion
,
and
the
latencies
to
onset
of
tremor
and
clonus
were
recorded
and
converted
to
threshold
dose
.

We
also
used
microdialysis
to
measure
basal
and
potassium
-stimulated

acetylcholine

(
ACh
)
release
in
the
CA1
region
of
the
hippocampus
.

Potassium
was
applied
by
reverse
dialysis
twice
,
separated
by
75
min
.

Hippocampal
ACh
also
was
measured
during
testing
for
handling
-
induced
convulsions
.

RESULTS
:

Sensitivity
to
several
convulsion
endpoints
induced
by
nicotine
,
carbachol
,
and
neostigmine
were
significantly
greater
in
WSR
versus
WSP
mice
.

In
microdialysis
experiments
,
the
lines
did
not
differ
in
basal
release
of
ACh
,
and
50
mM
KCl
increased
ACh
output
in
both
lines
of
mice
.

However
,
the
increase
in
release
of
ACh
produced
by
the
first
application
of
KCl
was
2-fold
higher
in
WSP
versus
WSR
mice
.

When
hippocampal
ACh
was
measured
during
testing
for
handling
-
induced
convulsions
,
extracellular
ACh
was
significantly
elevated
(
192
%
)
in
WSP
mice
,
but
was
nonsignificantly
elevated
(
59
%
)
in
WSR
mice
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
results
suggest
that
differences
in
cholinergic
activity
and
postsynaptic
sensitivity
to
cholinergic
convulsants
may
be
associated
with
ethanol
withdrawal
severity
and
implicate
cholinergic
mechanisms
in
alcohol
withdrawal
.

Specifically
,
WSP
mice
may
have
lower
sensitivity
to
cholinergic
convulsants
compared
with
WSR
because
of
postsynaptic
receptor
desensitization
brought
on
by
higher
activity
of
cholinergic
neurons
.

Prenatal
dexamethasone
programs

hypertension
and
renal
injury
in
the
rat
.

Dexamethasone
is
frequently
administered
to
the
developing
fetus
to
accelerate
pulmonary
development
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
if
prenatal
dexamethasone
programmed
a
progressive
increase
in
blood
pressure
and
renal
injury
in
rats
.

Pregnant
rats
were
given
either
vehicle
or
2
daily
intraperitoneal
injections
of
dexamethasone

(
0.2
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
on
gestational
days
11
and
12
,
13
and
14
,
15
and
16
,
17
and
18
,
or
19
and
20
.

Offspring
of
rats
administered
dexamethasone
on
days
15
and
16
gestation
had
a
20
%
reduction
in
glomerular
number
compared
with
control
at
6
to
9
months
of
age
(
22
527+/-509
versus
28
050+/-561
,
P<0.05
)
,
which
was
comparable
to
the
percent
reduction
in
glomeruli
measured
at
3
weeks
of
age
.

Six-
to
9-month
old
rats
receiving
prenatal
dexamethasone
on
days
17
and
18
of
gestation
had
a
17
%
reduction
in
glomeruli
(
23
380+/-587
)
compared
with
control
rats
(
P<0.05
)
.

Male
rats
that
received
prenatal
dexamethasone
on
days
15
and
16
,
17
and
18
,
and
13
and
14
of
gestation
had
elevated
blood
pressures
at
6
months
of
age
;
the
latter
group
did
not
have
a
reduction
in
glomerular
number
.

Adult
rats
given
dexamethasone
on
days
15
and
16
of
gestation
had
more
glomeruli
with
glomerulosclerosis
than
control
rats
.

This
study
shows
that
prenatal
dexamethasone
in
rats
results
in
a
reduction
in
glomerular
number
,
glomerulosclerosis
,
and
hypertension
when
administered
at
specific
points
during
gestation
.

Hypertension
was
observed
in
animals
that
had
a
reduction
in
glomeruli
as
well
as
in
a
group
that
did
not
have
a
reduction
in
glomerular
number
,
suggesting
that
a
reduction
in
glomerular
number
is
not
the
sole
cause
for
the
development
of
hypertension
.

The
risk

venous
thromboembolism
in
women
prescribed
cyproterone
acetate
in
combination
with
ethinyl
estradiol
:
a
nested
cohort
analysis
and
case
-
control
study
.

BACKGROUND
:

Cyproterone
acetate
combined
with
ethinyl
estradiol

(
CPA
/
EE
)
is
licensed
in
the
UK
for
the
treatment
of
women
with
acne
and
hirsutism
and
is
also
a
treatment
option
for
polycystic
ovary
syndrome

(
PCOS
)
.

Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
an
increased
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism

(
VTE
)
associated
with
CPA
/
EE
compared
with
conventional
combined
oral
contraceptives

(
COCs
)
.

We
believe
the
results
of
those
studies
may
have
been
affected
by
residual
confounding
.

METHODS
:

Using
the
General
Practice
Research
Database
we
conducted
a
cohort
analysis
and
case
-
control
study
nested
within
a
population
of
women
aged
between
15
and
39
years
with
acne
,
hirsutism
or
PCOS
to
estimate
the
risk
of
VTE
associated
with
CPA
/
EE
.

RESULTS
:

The
age
-
adjusted
incidence
rate
ratio
for
CPA
/
EE
versus
conventional
COCs
was
2.20
[
95
%
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
1.35
-
3.58
]
.

Using
as
the
reference
group
women
who
were
not
using
oral
contraception
,
had
no
recent
pregnancy
or
menopausal
symptoms
,
the
case
-
control
analysis
gave
an
adjusted
odds
ratio
(
OR(adj
)
)
of
7.44
(
95
%
CI
3.67
-
15.08
)
for
CPA
/
EE
use
compared
with
an
OR(adj
)
of
2.58
(
95
%
CI
1.60
-
4.18
)
for
use
of
conventional
COCs
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

We
have
demonstrated
an
increased
risk
of
VTE
associated
with
the
use
of
CPA
/
EE
in
women
with
acne
,
hirsutism
or
PCOS
although
residual
confounding
by
indication
can
not
be
excluded
.

Pseudoacromegaly
induced
by
the
long
-
term
use
of
minoxidil
.

Acromegaly
is
an
endocrine
disorder
caused
by
chronic
excessive
growth
hormone
secretion
from
the
anterior
pituitary
gland
.

Significant
disfiguring
changes
occur
as
a
result
of
bone
,
cartilage
,
and
soft
tissue
hypertrophy
,
including
the
thickening
of
the
skin
,
coarsening
of
facial
features
,
and
cutis
verticis
gyrata
.

Pseudoacromegaly
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
the
presence
of
similar
acromegaloid
features
in
the
absence
of
elevated
growth
hormone
or
insulin
-
like
growth
factor
levels
.

We
present
a
patient
with
pseudoacromegaly
that
resulted
from
the
long
-
term
use
of
minoxidil
at
an
unusually
high
dose
.

This
is
the
first
case
report

involvement
.

BACKGROUND
:

To
determine
the
onset
and
extent
of
combined
androgen
blockade
(
CAB)-induced
anemia
in
prostate
cancer
patients
without
bone
involvement
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
Forty
-
two
patients
with
biopsy
-
proven
prostatic
adenocarcinoma

[
26
with
stage
C
(
T3N0M0
)
and
16
with
stage
D1
(
T3N1M0
)
]
were
included
in
this
study
.

All
patients
received
CAB
[
leuprolide
acetate
(
LHRH
-
A
)
3.75
mg
,
intramuscularly
,
every
28
days
plus
250
mg
flutamide
,
tid
,
per
Os
]
and
were
evaluated
for
anemia
by
physical
examination
and
laboratory
tests
at
baseline
and
4
subsequent
intervals
(
1
,
2
,
3
and
6
months
post
-
CAB
)
.

Hb
,
PSA
and
Testosterone
measurements
were
recorded
.

Patients
with
stage
D2
-
3
disease
,
abnormal
hemoglobin
level
or
renal
and
liver
function
tests
that
were
higher
than
the
upper
limits
were
excluded
from
the
study
.

The
duration
of
the
study
was
six
months
.

RESULTS
:

The
mean
hemoglobin
(
Hb
)
levels
were
significantly
declined
in
all
patients
from
baseline
of
14.2
g
/
dl
to
14.0
g
/
dl
,
13.5
g
/
dl
,
13.2
g
/
dl
and
12.7
g
/
dl
at
1
,
2
,
3
and
6
months
post
-
CAB
,
respectively
.

Severe
and
clinically
evident
anemia
of
Hb
11
g
/
dl
with
clinical
symptoms
was
detected
in
6
patients
(
14.3
%
)
.

This
CAB
-
induced
anemia
was
normochromic
and
normocytic
.

At
six
months
post
-
CAB
,
patients
with
severe
anemia
had
a
Hb
mean
value
of
10.2
+
/-

0.1
g
/
dl
(
X
+
/-
SE
)
,
whereas
the
other
patients
had
mild
anemia
with
Hb
mean
value
of
13.2
+
/-
0.17
(
X
+
/-
SE
)
.

The
development
of
severe
anemia
at
6
months
post
-
CAB
was
predictable
by
the
reduction
of
Hb
baseline
value
of
more
than
2.5
g
/
dl
after
3
months
of
CAB
(
p
=
0.01
)
.

The
development
of
severe
CAB
-
induced
anemia
in
prostate
cancer
patients
did
not
correlate
with
T
baseline
values
(
T
3
ng
/
ml
versus
T
>
or
=
3
ng
/
ml
)
,
with
age
(
76
yrs
versus
>
or
=
76
yrs
)
,
and
clinical
stage
(
stage
C
versus
stage
D1
)
.

Severe
and
clinically
evident
anemia
was
easily
corrected
by
subcutaneous
injections
(
3
times
/
week
for
1
month
)
of
recombinant
erythropoietin
(
rHuEPO
-
beta
)
.

CONCLUSION

:
Our
data
suggest
that
rHuEPO
-
beta
correctable
CAB
-
induced

anemia
occurs
in
14.3
%
of
prostate
cancer
patients
after
6
months
of
therapy
.

Reversible
dilated
cardiomyopathy
related
to
amphotericin
B
therapy
.

We
describe
a
patient
who
developed
dilated
cardiomyopathy
and
clinical
congestive
heart
failure
after
2
months
of
therapy
with
amphotericin
B

(
AmB
)
for
disseminated
coccidioidomycosis
.

His
echocardiographic
abnormalities
and
heart
failure
resolved
after
posaconazole
was
substituted
for
AmB
.

It
is
important
to
recognize
the
rare
and
potentially
reversible
toxicity
of
AmB
.

Risks
of
the
consumption
of
beverages
containing
quinine
.

Although
the
United
States
Food
and
Drug
Administration
banned
its
use
for
nocturnal
leg
cramps
due
to
lack
of
safety
and
efficacy
,
quinine
is
widely
available
in
beverages
including
tonic
water
and
bitter
lemon
.

Numerous
anecdotal
reports
suggest
that
products
containing
quinine
may
produce
neurological
complications
,
including
confusion
,
altered
mental
status
,
seizures
,
and
coma
,
particularly
in
older
women
.

Psychologists
need
to
inquire
about
consumption
of

quinine

-containing
beverages
as
part
of
an
evaluation
process
.

Organophosphate
-induced
convulsions
and
prevention
of
neuropathological
damages
.

Such
organophosphorus

(
OP
)
compounds
as
diisopropylfluorophosphate

(
DFP
)
,
sarin
and
soman
are
potent
inhibitors
of
acetylcholinesterases
(
AChEs
)
and
butyrylcholinesterases
(
BChEs
)
.

The
acute
toxicity
of
OPs
is
the
result
of
their
irreversible
binding
with
AChEs
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
,
which
elevates
acetylcholine

(
ACh
)
levels
.

The
protective
action
of
subcutaneously
(
SC
)
administered
antidotes
or
their
combinations
in
DFP

(
2.0
mg
/
kg
BW
)
intoxication
was
studied
in
9
-
10-weeks
-
old
Han
-
Wistar
male
rats
.

The
rats
received
AChE
reactivator
pralidoxime-2-chloride

(
2PAM
)
(
30.0
mg
/
kg
BW
)
,
anticonvulsant
diazepam

(
2.0
mg
/
kg
BW
)
,
A(1)-
adenosine
receptor
agonist
N(6)-cyclopentyl
adenosine

(
CPA
)
(
2.0
mg
/
kg
BW
)
,
NMDA
-receptor
antagonist

dizocilpine
maleate
(
+
-MK801
hydrogen
maleate
)

(
2.0
mg
/
kg
BW
)
or
their
combinations
with
cholinolytic
drug
atropine
sulfate

(
50.0
mg
/
kg
BW
)

immediately
or
30
min
after
the
single
SC
injection
of
DFP
.

The
control
rats
received
atropine
sulfate
,
but
also
saline
and
olive
oil
instead
of
other
antidotes
and
DFP
,
respectively
.

All
rats
were
terminated
either
24
h
or
3
weeks
after
the
DFP
injection
.

The
rats
treated
with
DFP
-
atropine
showed
severe
typical
OP
-induced

toxicity
signs
.

When
CPA
,
diazepam
or
2PAM
was
given
immediately
after
DFP
-
atropine
,
these
treatments
prevented
,
delayed
or
shortened
the
occurrence
of
serious
signs
of
poisoning
.

Atropine
-
MK801
did
not
offer
any
additional
protection
against
DFP
toxicity
.

In
conclusion
,
CPA
,
diazepam
and
2PAM
in
combination
with
atropine
prevented
the
occurrence
of
serious
signs
of
poisoning
and
thus
reduced
the
toxicity
of
DFP
in
rat
.

Differential
modulation
by
estrogen
of
alpha2-adrenergic
and
I1-
imidazoline
receptor
-
mediated
hypotension
in
female
rats
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
estrogen
negatively
modulates
the
hypotensive
effect
of
clonidine

(
mixed
alpha2-/I1-receptor
agonist
)
in
female
rats
and
implicates
the
cardiovascular
autonomic
control
in
this
interaction
.

The
present
study
investigated
whether
this
effect
of
estrogen
involves
interaction
with
alpha2-
and/or
I1-receptors
.

Changes
evoked
by
a
single
intraperitoneal
injection
of
rilmenidine

(
600
microg
/
kg
)
or
alpha
-
methyldopa

(
100
mg
/
kg
)
,
selective
I1-
and
alpha2-receptor
agonists
,
respectively
,
in
blood
pressure
,
hemodynamic
variability
,
and
locomotor
activity
were
assessed
in
radiotelemetered
sham
-
operated
and
ovariectomized
(
Ovx
)

Sprague
-
Dawley
female
rats
with
or
without
12-wk
estrogen
replacement
.

Three
time
domain
indexes
of
hemodynamic
variability
were
employed
:
the
standard
deviation
of
mean
arterial
pressure
as
a
measure
of
blood
pressure
variability
and
the
standard
deviation
of
beat
-
to
-
beat
intervals
(
SDRR
)
and
the
root
mean
square
of
successive
differences
in
R
-
wave
-
to
-
R
-
wave
intervals
as
measures
of
heart
rate
variability
.

In
sham
-
operated
rats
,
rilmenidine
or
alpha
-
methyldopa
elicited
similar
hypotension

that
lasted
at
least
5
h
and
was
associated
with
reductions
in
standard
deviation
of
mean
arterial
pressure
.

SDRR
was
reduced
only
by
alpha
-
methyldopa
.

Ovx
significantly
enhanced
the
hypotensive
response
to
alpha
-
methyldopa
,
in
contrast
to
no
effect
on
rilmenidine
hypotension
.

The
enhanced
alpha
-
methyldopa

hypotension
in
Ovx
rats
was
paralleled
with
further
reduction
in
SDRR
and
a
reduced
locomotor
activity
.

Estrogen
replacement
(
17beta
-
estradiol
subcutaneous
pellet
,
14.2
microg
/
day
,
12
wk
)
of
Ovx
rats
restored
the
hemodynamic
and
locomotor
effects
of
alpha
-
methyldopa
to
sham
-
operated
levels
.

These
findings
suggest
that
estrogen
downregulates
alpha2-
but
not
I1-receptor
-
mediated
hypotension
and
highlight
a
role
for
the
cardiac
autonomic
control
in
alpha
-
methyldopa
-
estrogen
interaction
.

Cardioprotective
effect
of
tincture
of
Crataegus
on
isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
infarction
in
rats
.

Tincture
of
Crataegus
(
TCR
)
,
an
alcoholic
extract
of
the
berries
of
hawthorn

(
Crataegus
oxycantha
)
,
is
used
in
herbal
and
homeopathic
medicine
.

The
present
study
was
done
to
investigate
the
protective
effect
of
TCR
on
experimentally
induced
myocardial
infarction
in
rats
.

Pretreatment
of
TCR
,
at
a
dose
of
0.5
mL/100
g
bodyweight
per
day
,
orally
for
30
days
,
prevented
the
increase
in
lipid
peroxidation
and
activity
of
marker
enzymes
observed
in
isoproterenol

-induced
rats
(
85
mg
kg(-1
)

s.
c.
for
2
days
at
an
interval
of
24
h
)
.

TCR
prevented
the
isoproterenol
-induced
decrease
in
antioxidant
enzymes
in
the
heart
and
increased
the
rate
of
ADP
-stimulated

oxygen
uptake
and
respiratory
coupling
ratio
.

TCR
protected
against
pathological
changes
induced
by
isoproterenol
in
rat
heart
.

The
results
show
that
pretreatment
with
TCR
may
be
useful
in
preventing
the
damage
induced
by
isoproterenol
in
rat
heart
.

Safety
and
adverse
effects
associated
with
raloxifene
:
multiple
outcomes
of
raloxifene
evaluation
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
examine
the
effect
of
raloxifene
on
major
adverse
events
that
occur
with
postmenopausal
estrogen
therapy
or
tamoxifen
.

METHODS
:

The
Multiple
Outcomes
of
Raloxifene
Evaluation
,
a
multicenter
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
trial
,
enrolled
7,705
postmenopausal
women
with
osteoporosis
.

Women
were
randomly
assigned
to
raloxifene
60
mg
/

or
120
mg
/
d
or
placebo
.

Outcomes
included
venous
thromboembolism
,
cataracts
,
gallbladder
disease
,
and
endometrial
hyperplasia
or
cancer
.

RESULTS
:

During
a
mean
follow
-
up
of
3.3
years
,
raloxifene
was
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
venous
thromboembolism

(
relative
risk
[
RR
]
2.1
;
95
%

)
.

The
excess
event
rate
was
1.8
per
1,000
woman
-
years
(
95
%
CI
-0.5
-
4.1
)
,
and
the
number
needed
to
treat
to
cause
1
event
was
170
(
95
%
CI
100
-
582
)
over
3.3
years
.

Risk
in
the
raloxifene
group
was
higher
than
in
the
placebo
group
for
the
first
2
years
,
but
decreased
to
about
the
same
rate
as
in
the
placebo
group
thereafter
.

Raloxifene
did
not
increase
risk
for
cataracts

(

)
.

CONCLUSION
:

Raloxifene
was
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
venous
thromboembolism
,
but
there
was
no
increased

LEVEL
OF
EVIDENCE
:

I

Ceftriaxone
-associated
biliary
pseudolithiasis
in
paediatric
surgical
patients
.

It
is
well
known
that
ceftriaxone
leads
to
pseudolithiasis
in
some
patients
.

Clinical
and
experimental
studies
also
suggest
that
situations
causing
gallbladder
dysfunction
,
such
as
fasting
,
may
have
a
role
for
the
development
of
pseudolithiasis
.

In
this
study
,
we
prospectively
evaluated
the
incidence
and
clinical
importance
of
pseudolithiasis
in
paediatric
surgical
patients
receiving
ceftriaxone
treatment
,
who
often
had
to
fast
in
the
post
-
operative
period
.

Fifty
children
who
were
given
ceftriaxone
were
evaluated
by
serial
abdominal
sonograms
.

Of
those
,
13
(
26
%
)
developed
biliary
pathology
.

Comparison
of
the
patients
with
or
without
pseudolithiasis
revealed
no
significant
difference
with
respect
to
age
,
sex
,
duration
of
the
treatment
and
starvation
variables
.

After
cessation
of
the
treatment
,
pseudolithiasis
resolved
spontaneously
within
a
short
period
.

The
incidence
of
pseudolithiasis
is
not
affected
by
fasting
.

Evaluation
of
the
anticocaine
monoclonal
antibody
GNC92H2
as
an
immunotherapy
for
cocaine
overdose
.

The
illicit
use
of
cocaine
continues
in
epidemic
proportions
and
treatment
for
cocaine
overdose
remains
elusive
.

Current
protein
-
based
technology
offers
a
new
therapeutic
venue
by
which
antibodies
bind
the
drug
in
the
blood
stream
,
inactivating
its
toxic
effects
.

The
therapeutic
potential
of
the
anticocaine
antibody
GNC92H2
was
examined
using
a
model
of
cocaine
overdose
.

Swiss
albino
mice
prepared
with
intrajugular
catheters
were
tested
in
photocell
cages
after
administration
of
93
mg
/
kg
(
LD50
)
of
cocaine
and
GNC92H2
infusions
ranging
from
30
to
190
mg
/
kg
.

GNC92H2
was
delivered
30
min
before
,
concomitantly
or
3
min
after
cocaine
treatment
.

Significant
blockade
of
cocaine

toxicity
was
observed
with
the
higher
dose
of
GNC92H2

(
190
mg
/
kg
)
,
where
premorbid
behaviors
were
reduced
up
to
40
%
,
seizures
up
to
77
%
and
death
by
72
%
.

Importantly
,
GNC92H2
prevented
death

even
post-
cocaine
injection
.

The
results
support
the
important
potential
of
GNC92H2
as
a
therapeutic
tool
against
cocaine
overdose
.

The
effects
of
short
-
term
raloxifene
therapy
on
fibrinolysis
markers
:
TAFI
,
tPA
,
and
PAI-1
.

BACKGROUND
:

Markers
of
fibrinolysis
,
thrombin
-
activatable
fibrinolysis
inhibitor
(
TAFI
)
,
tissue
-
type
plasminogen
activator
(
tPA
)
,
and
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor-1
(
PAI-1
)
levels
were
studied
for
the
evaluation
of
short
-
term
effects
of
raloxifene
administration
in
postmenopausal
women
.

METHODS
:

Thirty
-
nine
postmenopausal
women
with
osteopenia
or
osteoporosis
were
included
in
this
prospective
,
controlled
clinical
study
.

Twenty
-
five
women
were
given
raloxifene
hydrochloride

(
60
mg
/
day
)
plus
calcium

(
500
mg
/
day
)
.

Age
-
matched
controls
(
n
=
14
)
were
given
only
calcium
.

Plasma
TAFI
,
tPA
,
and
PAI-1
antigen
levels
were
measured
at
baseline
and
after
3
months
of
treatment
by
commercially
available
ELISA
kits
.

Variations
of
individuals
were
assessed
by
Wilcoxon
's
test
.

Relationship
between
those
markers
and
demographic
characteristics
were
investigated
.

RESULTS
:

Three
months
of
raloxifene
treatment
was
associated
with
a
significant
decrease
in
the
plasma
TAFI
antigen
concentrations
(
16
%
change
,
P
0.01
)
,
and
a
significant
increase
in
tPA
antigen
concentrations
(
25
%
change
,
P
0.05
)
.

A
significant
correlation
was
found
between
baseline
TAFI
antigen
concentrations
and
the
duration
of
amenorrhea

(
P
0.05
;
r
=
0.33
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

We
suggest
that
the
increased
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
due
to
raloxifene
treatment
may
be
related
to
increased
tPA
levels
,
but
not
TAFI
levels
.

disease
who
developed
a
markedly
prolonged
QT
interval
and
torsades
de
pointes

(
TdP
)
after
taking
ketoconazole
for
treatment
of
fungal
infection
.

Her
QT
interval
returned
to
normal
upon
withdrawal
of
ketoconazole
.

Genetic
study
did
not
find
any
mutation
in
her
genes
that
encode
cardiac
IKr
channel
proteins
.

We
postulate
that
by
virtue
of
its
direct
blocking
action
on
IKr
,
ketoconazole
alone
may
prolong
QT
interval
and
induce
TdP
.

This
calls
for
attention
when
ketoconazole
is
administered
to
patients
with
risk
factors
for
acquired
long
QT
syndrome
.

Pharmacological
evidence
for
the
potential
of
Daucus
carota
in
the
management
of
cognitive
dysfunctions
.

The
present
study
was
aimed
at
investigating
the
effects
of
Daucus
carota
seeds
on
cognitive
functions
,
total
serum
cholesterol
levels
and
brain
cholinesterase
activity
in
mice
.

The
ethanolic
extract
of
Daucus
carota
seeds

(
DCE
)
was
administered
orally
in
three
doses
(
100
,
200
,
400
mg
/
kg
)
for
seven
successive
days
to
different
groups
of
young
and
aged
mice
.

Elevated
plus
maze
and
passive
avoidance
apparatus
served
as
the
exteroceptive
behavioral
models
for
testing
memory
.

Diazepam
-
,
scopolamine
-
and
ageing
-
induced
amnesia
served
as
the
interoceptive
behavioral
models
.

DCE
(
200
,
400
mg
/
kg
,
p.o
.
)
showed
significant
improvement
in
memory
scores
of
young
and
aged
mice
.

The
extent
of
memory
improvement
evoked
by
DCE
was
23
%
at
the
dose
of
200
mg
/
kg
and
35
%
at
the
dose
of
400
mg
/
kg
in
young
mice
using
elevated
plus
maze
.

Similarly
,
significant
improvements
in
memory
scores
were
observed
using
passive
avoidance
apparatus
and
aged
mice
.

Furthermore
,
DCE
reversed
the
amnesia
induced
by
scopolamine
(
0.4
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
and
diazepam
(
1
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
.

Daucus
carota
extract
(
200
,
400
mg
/
kg
,
p.o
.
)
reduced
significantly
the
brain
acetylcholinesterase
activity
and
cholesterol
levels
in
young
and
aged
mice
.

The
extent
of
inhibition
of
brain
cholinesterase
activity
evoked
by
DCE
at
the
dose
of
400
mg
/
kg
was
22
%
in
young
and
19
%
in
aged
mice
.

There
was
a
remarkable
reduction
in
total
cholesterol
level
as
well
,
to
the
extent
of
23
%
in
young
and
21
%
in
aged
animals
with
this
dose
of
DCE
.

Therefore
,
DCE
may
prove
to
be
a
useful
remedy
for
the
management
of
cognitive
dysfunctions
on
account
of
its
multifarious
beneficial
effects
such
as
,
memory
improving
property
,
cholesterol
lowering
property
and
anticholinesterase
activity
.

Cauda
equina
syndrome
after
epidural
steroid
injection
:
a
case
report
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Conventional
treatment
methods
of
lumbusacral
radiculopathy
are
physical
therapy
,
epidural
steroid
injections
,
oral
medications
,
and
spinal
manipulative
therapy
.

Cauda
equina
syndrome
is
a
rare
complication
of
epidural
anesthesia
.

The
following
case
is
a
report
of
cauda
equina
syndrome
possibly
caused
by
epidural
injection
of
triamcinolone
and
bupivacaine
.

CLINICAL
FEATURES
:

A
50-year
-
old
woman
with
low
back
and
right
leg
pain
was
scheduled
for
epidural
steroid
injection
.

INTERVENTION
AND
OUTCOME
:

An
18-gauge
Touhy
needle
was
inserted
until
loss
of
resistance
occurred
at
the
L4
-
5
level
.

Spread
of
the
contrast
medium
within
the
epidural
space
was
determined
by
radiographic
imaging
.

After
verifying
the
epidural
space
,
bupivacaine
and
triamcinolone
diacetate
were
injected
.

After
the
injection
,
there
was
a
reduction
in
radicular
symptoms
.

Three
hours
later
,
she
complained
of
perineal
numbness
and
lower
extremity
weakness
.

The
neurologic
evaluation
revealed
loss
of
sensation
in
the
saddle
area
and
medial
aspect
of
her
right
leg
.

There
was
a
decrease
in
the
perception
of
pinprick
test
.

Deep
-
tendon
reflexes
were
decreased
especially
in
the
right
leg
.

She
was
unable
to
urinate
.

The
patient
's
symptoms
improved
slightly
over
the
next
few
hours
.

She
had
a
gradual
return
of
motor
function
and
ability
of
feeling
Foley
catheter
.

All
of
the
symptoms
were
completely
resolved
over
the
next
8
hours
.

CONCLUSION
:

Complications
associated
with
epidural
steroid
injections
are
rare
.

Clinical
examination
and
continued
vigilance
for
neurologic
deterioration
after
epidural
steroid
injections
is
important
.

High
-
dose

testosterone
is
associated
with
atherosclerosis
in
postmenopausal
women
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
study
the
long
-
term
effects
of
androgen
treatment
on
atherosclerosis
in
postmenopausal
women
.

METHODS
:

In
a
population
-
based
study
in
513
naturally
postmenopausal
women
aged
54
-
67
years
,
we
studied
the
association
between
self
-
reported
intramuscularly
administered
high
-
dose
estrogen
-
testosterone
therapy
(
estradiol-
and
testosterone
esters
)
and
aortic
atherosclerosis
.

Aortic
atherosclerosis
was
diagnosed
by
radiographic
detection
of
calcified
deposits
in
the
abdominal
aorta
,
which
have
been
shown
to
reflect
intima
atherosclerosis
.

Hormone
therapy
users
were
compared
with
never
users
.

RESULTS
:

Intramuscular
hormone
therapy
use
for
1
year
or
longer
was
reported
by
25
women
.

In
almost
half
of
these
women
severe
atherosclerosis
of
the
aorta
was
present
(
n=11
)
,
while
in
women
without
hormone
use
severe
atherosclerosis
of
the
aorta
was
present
in
less
than
20
%
(
OR
3.1
;
95
%
CI
,
1.1
-
8.5
,
adjusted
for
age
,
years
since
menopause
,
smoking
,
and
body
mass
index
)
.

The
association
remained
after
additional
adjustment
for
diabetes
,
cholesterol
level
,
systolic
blood
pressure
,
or
alcohol
use
.

No
association
was
found
for
hormone
use
less
than
1
year
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
results
suggest
that
high
-
dose
testosterone
therapy
may
adversely
affect
atherosclerosis
in
postmenopausal
women
and
indicate
that
androgen
replacement
in
these
women
may
not
be
harmless
.

Sirolimus
-associated
proteinuria
and
renal
dysfunction
.

Sirolimus
is
a
novel
immunosuppressant
with
potent
antiproliferative
actions
through
its
ability
to
inhibit
the
raptor
-
containing
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
protein
kinase
.

Sirolimus
represents
a
major
therapeutic
advance
in
the
prevention
of
acute
renal
allograft
rejection
and
chronic
allograft
nephropathy
.

Its
role
in
the
therapy
of
glomerulonephritis
,
autoimmunity
,

cystic
renal
diseases
and
renal
cancer
is
under
investigation
.

Because
sirolimus
does
not
share
the
vasomotor
renal
adverse
effects
exhibited
by
calcineurin
inhibitors
,
it
has
been
designated
a
'
non-
nephrotoxic
drug
'
.

However
,
clinical
reports
suggest
that
,
under
some
circumstances
,
sirolimus
is
associated
with
proteinuria
and
acute
renal
dysfunction
.

A
common
risk
factor
appears
to
be
presence
of
pre
-
existing
chronic
renal
damage
.

The
mechanisms
of
sirolimus
-associated
proteinuria
are
multifactorial
and
may
be
due
to
an
increase
in
glomerular
capillary
pressure
following
calcineurin
inhibitor
withdrawal
.

It
has
also
been
suggested
that
sirolimus
directly
causes
increased
glomerular
permeability
/
injury
,
but
evidence
for
this
mechanism
is
currently
inconclusive
.

The
acute
renal
dysfunction
associated
with
sirolimus

(
such
as
in
delayed
graft
function
)
may
be
due
to
suppression
of
compensatory
renal
cell
proliferation
and
survival
/
repair
processes
.

Although
these
adverse
effects
occur
in
some
patients
,
their
occurrence
could
be
minimised
by
knowledge
of
the
molecular
effects
of
sirolimus
on
the
kidney
,
the
use
of
sirolimus
in
appropriate
patient
populations
,
close
monitoring
of
proteinuria
and
renal
function
,
use
of
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
or
angiotensin
II
receptor
blockers
if
proteinuria
occurs
and
withdrawal
if
needed
.

Further
long
-
term
analysis
of
renal
allograft
studies
using
sirolimus
as
de
novo
immunosuppression
along
with
clinical
and
laboratory
studies
will
refine
these
issues
in
the
future
.

Progressive
myopathy
with
up
-
regulation
of
MHC
-

I
associated
with
statin
therapy
.

Statins
can
cause
a
necrotizing
myopathy
and
hyperCKaemia
which
is
reversible
on
cessation
of
the
drug
.

What
is
less
well
known
is
a
phenomenon
whereby
statins
may
induce
a
myopathy
,
which
persists
or
may
progress
after
stopping
the
drug
.

We
investigated
the
muscle
pathology
in
8
such
cases
.

All
had
myofibre
necrosis
but
only
3
had
an
inflammatory
infiltrate
.

In
all
cases
there
was
diffuse
or
multifocal
up
-
regulation
of
MHC
-
I
expression
even
in
non-
necrotic
fibres
.

Progressive
improvement
occurred
in
7
cases
after
commencement
of
prednisolone
and
methotrexate
,
and
in
one
case
spontaneously
.

These
observations
suggest
that
statins
may
initiate
an
immune
-
mediated
myopathy
that
persists
after
withdrawal
of
the
drug
and
responds
to
immunosuppressive
therapy
.

The
mechanism
of
this
myopathy
is
uncertain
but
may
involve
the
induction
by
statins
of
an
endoplasmic
reticulum
stress
response
with
associated
up
-
regulation
of
MHC
-
I
expression
and
antigen
presentation
by
muscle
fibres
.

Direct
inhibition
of
cardiac
hyperpolarization
-
activated
cyclic
nucleotide
-gated
pacemaker
channels
by
clonidine
.

BACKGROUND
:

Inhibition
of
cardiac
sympathetic
tone
represents
an
important
strategy
for
treatment
of
cardiovascular
disease
,
including
arrhythmia
,
coronary
heart
disease
,
and
chronic
heart
failure
.

Activation
of
presynaptic
alpha2-adrenoceptors
is
the
most
widely
accepted
mechanism
of
action
of
the
antisympathetic
drug
clonidine
;
however
,
other
target
proteins
have
been
postulated
to
contribute
to
the
in
vivo
actions
of
clonidine
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
To
test
whether
clonidine
elicits
pharmacological
effects
independent
of
alpha2-adrenoceptors
,
we
have
generated
mice
with
a
targeted
deletion
of
all
3
alpha2-adrenoceptor
subtypes
(
alpha2ABC-/-
)
.

Alpha2ABC-/-
mice
were
completely
unresponsive
to
the
analgesic
and
hypnotic
effects
of
clonidine
;
however
,
clonidine
significantly
lowered
heart
rate
in
alpha2ABC-/-
mice
by
up
to
150
bpm
.

Clonidine
-induced

bradycardia
in
conscious
alpha2ABC-/-
mice
was
32.3
%
(
10
microg
/
kg
)
and
26.6
%
(
100
microg
/
kg
)
of
the
effect
in
wild
-
type
mice
.

A
similar
bradycardic
effect
of
clonidine
was
observed
in
isolated
spontaneously
beating
right
atria
from
alpha2ABC
-
knockout
and
wild
-
type
mice
.

Clonidine
inhibited
the
native
pacemaker
current
(
I(f
)
)
in
isolated
sinoatrial
node
pacemaker
cells
and
the
I(f)-generating
hyperpolarization
-
activated
cyclic
nucleotide
-gated

(
HCN
)
2
and
HCN4
channels
in
transfected
HEK293
cells
.

As
a
consequence
of
blocking
I(f
)
,
clonidine
reduced
the
slope
of
the
diastolic
depolarization
and
the
frequency
of
pacemaker
potentials
in
sinoatrial
node
cells
from
wild
-
type
and
alpha2ABC
-
knockout
mice
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Direct
inhibition
of
cardiac
HCN
pacemaker
channels
contributes
to
the
bradycardic
effects
of
clonidine
gene
-
targeted
mice
in
vivo
,
and
thus
,
clonidine
-like
drugs
represent
novel
structures
for
future
HCN
channel
inhibitors
.

Influence
of
smoking
on
developing
cochlea
.

Does
smoking

during
pregnancy
affect
the
amplitudes
of
transient
evoked
otoacoustic
emissions
in
newborns
?

OBJECTIVE
:
Maternal
tobacco

smoking
has
negative
effects
on
fetal
growth
.

The
influence
of
smoking
during
pregnancy
on
the
developing
cochlea
has
not
been
estimated
,
although
smoking
has
been
positively
associated
with
hearing
loss
in
adults
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effects
of
maternal
smoking
on
transient
evoked
otoacoustic
emissions
(
TEOAEs
)
of
healthy
neonates
.

METHODS
:

This
study
was
undertaken
as
part
of
neonatal
screening
for
hearing
impairment
and
involved
both
ears
of
200
newborns
.

Newborns
whose
mothers
reported
smoking
during
pregnancy
(
n=200
ears
)
were
compared
to
a
control
group
of
newborns
(
n=200
ears
)
,
whose
mothers
were
non
-
smokers
.

Exposure
to
tobacco
was
characterized
as
low
(
5
cigarettes
per
day
,
n=88
ears
)
,
moderate
(
5
or
=
cigarettes
per
day<10
,
n=76
)
or
high
(
>
or
=
10
cigarettes
per
day
,
n=36
)
.

RESULTS
:

In
exposed
neonates
,
TEOAEs
mean
response
(
across
frequency
)
and
mean
amplitude
at
4000Hz
was
significantly
lower
than
in
non
-
exposed
neonates
.

Comparisons
between
exposed
newborns
'
subgroups
revealed
no
significant
differences
.

However
,
by
comparing
each
subgroup
to
control
group
,
we
found
statistically
significant
decreases
of
TEOAEs
amplitudes
at
4000Hz
for
all
three
groups
.

Mean
TEOAEs
responses
of
highly
exposed
newborns
were
also
significantly
lower
in
comparison
to
our
control
group
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
utero
,
exposure
to
tobacco
smoking
seems
to
have
a
small
impact
on
outer
hair
cells
.

These
effects
seem
to
be
equally
true
for
all
exposed
newborns
,
regardless
of
the
degree
of
exposure
.

Further
studies
are
needed
in
order
to
establish
a
potential
negative
effect
of
maternal
smoking
on
the
neonate
's
hearing
acuity
.

Neuroinflammation
and
behavioral
abnormalities
after
neonatal
terbutaline
treatment
in
rats
:
implications
for
autism
.

Autism
is
a
neurodevelopmental
disorder
presenting
before
3
years
of
age
with
deficits
in
communication
and
social
skills
and
repetitive
behaviors
.

In
addition
to
genetic
influences
,
recent
studies
suggest
that
prenatal
drug
or
chemical
exposures
are
risk
factors
for
autism
.

Terbutaline
,
a
beta2-adrenoceptor
agonist
used
to
arrest
preterm
labor
,
has
been
associated
with
increased
concordance
for
autism
in
dizygotic
twins
.

We
studied
the
effects
of
terbutaline
on
microglial
activation
in
different
brain
regions
and
behavioral
outcomes
in
developing
rats
.

Newborn
rats
were
given
terbutaline

(
10
mg
/
kg
)
daily
on
postnatal
days
(
PN
)
2
to
5
or
PN
11
to
14
and
examined
24
h
after
the
last
dose
and
at
PN
30
.

Immunohistochemical
studies
showed
that
administration
of
terbutaline
on
PN
2
to
5
produced
a
robust
increase
in
microglial
activation
on
PN
30
in
the
cerebral
cortex
,
as
well
as
in
cerebellar
and
cerebrocortical

white
matter
.

None
of
these
effects
occurred
in
animals
given

terbutaline
on
PN
11
to
14
.

In
behavioral
tests
,
animals
treated
with
terbutaline
on
PN
2
to
5
showed
consistent
patterns
of
hyper
-
reactivity
to
novelty
and
aversive
stimuli
when
assessed
in
a
novel
open
field
,
as
well
as
in
the
acoustic
startle
response
test
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
beta2-adrenoceptor
overstimulation
during
an
early
critical
period
results
in
microglial
activation
associated
with
innate
neuroinflammatory
pathways
and
behavioral
abnormalities
,
similar
to
those
described
in
autism
.

This
study
provides
a
useful
animal
model
for
understanding
the
neuropathological
processes
underlying
autism
spectrum
disorders
.

Acute
myocarditis
associated
with
clozapine
.

OBJECTIVE
:

A
case
of
acute
myocarditis
associated
with
the
commencement
of
clozapine
is
described
,
highlighting
the
onset
,
course
and
possible
contributing
factors
.

There
is
an
urgent
need
to
raise
awareness
about
this
potentially
fatal
complication
of
clozapine
use
.

RESULTS
:

A
20-year
-
old
male
with
schizophrenia
developed
a
sudden
onset
of
myocarditis
after
commencement
of
clozapine
.

The
patient
recovered
with
intensive
medical
support
.

The
symptoms
occurred
around
2
weeks
after
starting
clozapine
in
an
inpatient
setting
.

Possible
contributing
factors
may
have
been
concomitant
antidepressant
use
and
unaccustomed
physical
activity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Myocarditis
is
an
increasingly
recognized
complication
associated
with
the
use
of
clozapine
.

It
can
be
fatal
if
not
recognized
and
treated
early
.

Considering
that
clozapine
remains
the
gold
standard
in
treatment
of
resistant
psychosis
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
raise
awareness
among
medical
and
paramedical
staff
involved
in
the
care
of

There
are
also
implications
for

Encephalopathy
induced
by
levetiracetam
added
to
valproate
.

BACKGROUND
:

We
report
on
the
manifestation
of
a
levetiracetam

(
LEV
)
-induced
encephalopathy
.

FINDINGS
:

A
28-year
-
old
man
suffering
from
idiopathic
epilepsy
with
generalized
seizures
was
treated
with
LEV

(
3000
mg
)
added
to
valproate

(
VPA
)
(
2000
mg
)
.

Frequency
of
generalized
tonic
-
clonic
seizures
increased
from
one
per
6
months
to
two
per
month
.

Neuropsychological
testing
showed
impaired
word
fluency
,
psychomotor
speed
and
working
memory
.

The
interictal
electroencephalogram
(
EEG
)
showed
a
generalized
slowing
to
5
per
second
theta
rhythms
with
bilateral
generalized
high
-
amplitude
discharges
.

OUTCOME
:

Following
discontinuation
of
LEV
,
EEG
and
neuropsychological
findings
improved
and
seizure
frequency
decreased
.

Norepinephrine
signaling
through
beta
-
adrenergic
receptors
is
critical
for
expression
of
cocaine

-induced

anxiety
.

BACKGROUND
:

Cocaine
is
a
widely
abused
psychostimulant
that
has
both
rewarding
and
aversive
properties
.

While
the
mechanisms
underlying
cocaine
's
rewarding
effects
have
been
studied
extensively
,
less
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
unpleasant
behavioral
states
induced
by
cocaine
,
such
as
anxiety
.

METHODS
:

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
the
performance
of
dopamine

beta
-
hydroxylase
knockout
(
Dbh
-/-
)
mice
,
which
lack
norepinephrine

(
NE
)
,
in
the
elevated
plus
maze
(
EPM
)
to
examine
the
contribution
of
noradrenergic
signaling
to
cocaine

-induced

anxiety
.

RESULTS
:

We
found
that
cocaine
dose
-
dependently
increased

anxiety
-like
behavior
in
control
(
Dbh
+
/-

)
mice
,
as
measured
by
a
decrease
in
open
arm
exploration
.

The
Dbh
-/-
mice
had
normal
baseline
performance
in
the
EPM
but
were
completely
resistant
to
the
anxiogenic
effects
of
cocaine
.

Cocaine
-induced

anxiety
was
also
attenuated
in
Dbh
+
/-
mice
following
administration
of
disulfiram
,
a
dopamine
beta
-
hydroxylase
(
DBH
)
inhibitor
.

In
experiments
using
specific
adrenergic
antagonists
,
we
found
that
pretreatment
with
the
beta
-
adrenergic
receptor
antagonist
propranolol
blocked
cocaine

-induced

anxiety
-like
behavior
in
Dbh
+
/-

and
wild
-
type
C57BL6/J
mice
,
while
the
alpha(1
)
antagonist

prazosin
and
the
alpha(2
)
antagonist

yohimbine
had
no
effect
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
results
indicate
that
noradrenergic
signaling
via
beta
-
adrenergic
receptors
is
required
for
cocaine
-induced
anxiety
in
mice
.

Clonidine
for
attention
-
deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder
:
II
.

ECG
changes
and
adverse
events
analysis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
examine
the
safety
and
tolerability
of

clonidine
used
alone
or
with
methylphenidate
in
children
with
attention
-
deficit
/
hyperactivity
disorder

(
ADHD
)
.

METHOD
:

In
a
16-week
multicenter
,
double
-
blind
trial
,
122
children
with
ADHD
were
randomly
assigned
to
clonidine

(
n
=
31
)
,

methylphenidate
(
n
=
29
)
,
clonidine
and
methylphenidate
(
n
=
32
)
,
or
placebo
(
n
=
30
)
.

Doses
were
flexibly
titrated
up
to
0.6
mg
/
day
for
clonidine
and
60
mg
/
day
for
methylphenidate

(
both
with
divided
dosing
)
.

Groups
were
compared
regarding
adverse
events
and
changes
from
baseline
to
week
16
in
electrocardiograms
and
vital
signs
.

RESULTS
:

There
were
more
incidents
of
bradycardia
in
subjects
treated
with
clonidine
compared
with
those
not
treated
with
clonidine

(
17.5
%
versus
3.4
%
;
p
=
.02
)
,
but
no
other
significant
group
differences
regarding
electrocardiogram
and
other
cardiovascular
outcomes
.

There
were
no
suggestions
of
interactions
between
clonidine
and
methylphenidate
regarding
cardiovascular
outcomes
.

Moderate
or
severe
adverse
events
were
more
common
in
subjects
on
clonidine
(
79.4
%
versus
49.2
%
;
p
=
.0006
)
but
not
associated
with
higher
rates
of
early
study
withdrawal
.

Drowsiness
was
common
on
clonidine
,
but
generally
resolved
by
6
to
8
weeks
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Clonidine
,
used
alone
or
with
methylphenidate
,
appears
safe
and
well
tolerated
in
childhood
ADHD
.

Physicians
prescribing
clonidine
should
monitor
for
bradycardia
and
advise
patients
about
the
high
likelihood
of
initial
drowsiness
.

Thalidomide
has
limited
single
-
agent
activity
in
relapsed
or
refractory
indolent
non

Hodgkin
lymphomas
:
a
phase
II
trial
of
the
Cancer
and
Leukemia
Group
B.
Thalidomide
is
an
immunomodulatory
agent
with
demonstrated
activity
in
multiple
myeloma
,
mantle
cell
lymphoma
and
lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma
.

Its
activity
is
believed
to
be
due
modulation
of
the
tumour
milieu
,
including
downregulation
of
angiogenesis
and
inflammatory
cytokines
.

Between
July
2001
and
April
2004
,
24
patients
with
relapsed
/
refractory
indolent
lymphomas
received
thalidomide

200
mg
daily
with
escalation
by
100
mg
daily
every
1
-
2
weeks
as
tolerated
,
up
to
a
maximum
of
800
mg
daily
.

Patients
had
received
a
median
of
2
(
range
,
1
-
4
)
prior
regimens
.

Of
24
evaluable
patients
,
two
achieved
a
complete
remission
and
one
achieved
a
partial
remission
for
an
overall
response
rate
of
12.5
%
(
95
%
confidence
interval
:
2.6
-
32.4
%
)
.

Eleven
patients
progressed
during
therapy
.

Grade
3
-
4
adverse
effects
included
myelosuppression
,
fatigue
,
somnolence
/
depressed
mood
,
neuropathy
and
dyspnea
.

Of
concern
was
the
occurrence
of
four
thromboembolic
events
.

Our
results
failed
to
demonstrate
an
important
response
rate
to
single
agent
thalidomide
in
indolent
lymphomas
and
contrast
with
the
higher
activity
level
reported
with
the
second
generation
immunomodulatory
agent
,
lenalidomide
.

Intracavernous

)
together
for
30
consecutive

Development
of
ocular
myasthenia
during
pegylated
interferon
and
ribavirin
treatment
for
chronic
hepatitis
C
.

A
63-year
-
old
male
experienced
sudden
diplopia
after
9
weeks
of
administration
of
pegylated
interferon
(
IFN
)
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
for
chronic
hepatitis
C

(
CHC
)
.

Ophthalmologic
examinations
showed
ptosis
on
the
right
upper
lid
and
restricted
right
eye
movement
without
any
other
neurological
signs
.

A
brain
imaging
study
and
repetitive
nerve
stimulation
test
indicated
no
abnormality
.

The
acetylcholine
receptor

antibody
titer
and
response
to
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
were
negative
,
and
the
results
of
thyroid
function
tests
were
normal
.

The
patient
's
ophthalmological
symptoms
improved
rapidly
3
weeks
after
discontinuation
of
pegylated
IFN
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
.

The
ocular
myasthenia

associated
with
combination
therapy
of
pegylated
IFN
alpha-2b
and
ribavirin
for
CHC
is
very
rarely
reported
;
therefore
,
we
present
this
case
with
a
review
of
the
various
eye
complications
of
IFN
therapy
.

The
glycine
transporter-1
inhibitor
SSR103800
displays
a
selective
and
specific
antipsychotic
-
like
profile
in
normal
and
transgenic
mice
.

Schizophrenia
has
been
initially
associated
with
dysfunction
in
dopamine
neurotransmission
.

However
,
the
observation
that
antagonists
of
the
glutamate
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptor
produce

schizophrenic
-like

symptoms
in
humans
has
led
to
the
idea
of
a
dysfunctioning
of
the
glutamatergic
system
via
its
NMDA
receptor
.

As
a
result
,
there
is
a
growing
interest
in
the
development
of
pharmacological
agents
with
potential
antipsychotic
properties
that
enhance
the
activity
of
the
glutamatergic
system
via
a
modulation
of
the
NMDA
receptor
.

Among
them
are
glycine

transporter-1
(
GlyT1
)
inhibitors
such
as
SSR103800
,
which
indirectly
enhance
NMDA
receptor
function
by
increasing
the
glycine

(
a
co
-
agonist
for
the
NMDA
receptor
)
levels
in
the
synapse
.

This
study
aimed
at
investigating
the
potential
antipsychotic
-
like
properties
of
SSR103800
,
with
a
particular
focus
on
models
of
hyperactivity
,
involving
either
drug
challenge
(
ie
,
amphetamine
and
MK-801
)
or
transgenic
mice
(
ie
,
NMDA
Nr1(neo-/-
)
and
DAT(-/-
)
)
.

Results
showed
that
SSR103800
(
10
-
30
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
)
blocked
hyperactivity
induced
by
the
non
-
competitive
NMDA
receptor
antagonist
,
MK-801
and
partially
reversed
spontaneous
hyperactivity
of
NMDA
Nr1(neo-/-
)
mice
.

In
contrast
,
SSR103800
failed
to
affect
hyperactivity
induced
by
amphetamine
or
naturally
observed
in
dopamine
transporter
(
DAT(-/-
)
)

knockout
mice
(
10
-
30
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
)
.

Importantly
,
both
classical
(
haloperidol
)
and
atypical
(
olanzapine
,
clozapine
and
aripiprazole
)
antipsychotics
were
effective
in
all
these
models
of
hyperactivity
.

However
,
unlike
these
latter
,
SSR103800
did
not
produce
catalepsy

(
retention
on
the
bar
test
)
up
to
30
mg
/
kg
p.o
.

Together
these
findings
show
that
the
GlyT1
inhibitor
,
SSR103800
,
produces
antipsychotic
-
like
effects
,
which
differ
from
those
observed
with
compounds
primarily
targeting
the
dopaminergic
system
,
and
has
a
reduced
side
-
effect
potential
as
compared
with
these
latter
drugs
.

Phenylephrine
but
not
ephedrine

reduces
frontal
lobe
oxygenation
following
anesthesia
-
induced
hypotension
.

BACKGROUND
:

Vasopressor
agents
are
used
to
correct
anesthesia
-
induced
hypotension
.

We
describe
the
effect
of
phenylephrine
and
ephedrine
on
frontal
lobe
oxygenation
(
S(c)O(2
)
)
following
anesthesia
-
induced
hypotension
.

METHODS
:

Following
induction
of
anesthesia
by
fentanyl

(
0.15
mg
kg(-1
)
)
and
propofol
(
2.0
mg
kg(-1
)
)
,
13
patients
received
phenylephrine
(
0.1
mg
iv
)
and
12
patients
received
ephedrine

(
10
mg
iv
)
to
restore
mean
arterial
pressure
(
MAP
)
.

Heart
rate
(
HR
)
,
MAP
,
stroke
volume
(
SV
)
,
cardiac
output
(
CO
)
,
and
frontal
lobe
oxygenation
(
S(c)O(2
)
)
were
registered
.

RESULTS
:

Induction
of
anesthesia
was
followed
by
a
decrease
in
MAP
,
HR
,
SV
,
and
CO
concomitant
with
an
elevation
in
S(c)O(2
)
.

After
administration
of
phenylephrine
,
MAP
increased
(
51
+
/-
12
to
81
+
/-

13
mmHg
;
P
0.001
;
mean
+
/-
SD
)
.

However
,
a
14
%
(
from
70
+
/-
8
%
to
60
+
/-
7
%
)
reduction
in
S(c)O(2
)

(
P

)
followed
with
no
change
in
CO
(
3.7
+
/-
1.1
to
3.4
+
/-

0.9

l
min(-1
)
)
.

The
administration
of
ephedrine
led
to
a
similar
increase
in
MAP
(
53
+
/-
9
to
79
+
/-

8
mmHg
;
P
0.001
)
,
restored
CO
(
3.2
+
/-
1.2
to
5.0
+
/-

1.3
l
min(-1
)
)
,
and
preserved
S(c)O(2
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
utilization
of
phenylephrine
to
correct
hypotension
induced
by
anesthesia
has
a
negative
impact
on
S(c)O(2
)
while
ephedrine
maintains
frontal
lobe
oxygenation
potentially
related
to
an
increase
in
CO
.

A
novel
,
multiple
symptom
model
of
obsessive
-
compulsive
-
like
behaviors
in
animals
.

BACKGROUND
:

Current
animal
models
of
obsessive
-
compulsive
disorder

(
OCD
)
typically
involve
acute
,
drug
-
induced
symptom
provocation
or
a
genetic
association
with
stereotypies
or
anxiety
.

None
of
these
current
models
demonstrate
multiple
OCD
-like
behaviors
.

METHODS
:

Neonatal
rats
were
treated
with
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
clomipramine
or
vehicle
between
days
9
and
16
twice
daily
and
behaviorally
tested
in
adulthood
.

RESULTS
:

Clomipramine
exposure
in
immature
rats
produced
significant
behavioral
and
biochemical
changes
that
include
enhanced
anxiety
(
elevated
plus
maze
and
marble
burying
)
,
behavioral
inflexibility

(
perseveration
in
the
spontaneous
alternation
task
and
impaired
reversal
learning
)
,
working
memory
impairment

(
e.g.
,
win
-
shift
paradigm
)
,
hoarding
,
and
corticostriatal
dysfunction
.

Dopamine
D2
receptors
were
elevated
in
the
striatum
,
whereas
serotonin

2C
,
but
not

serotonin
1A
,
receptors
were
elevated
in
the
orbital
frontal
cortex
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
is
the
first
demonstration
of
multiple
symptoms
consistent
with
an
OCD
-like
profile
in
animals
.

Moreover
,
these
behaviors
are
accompanied
by
biochemical
changes
in
brain
regions
previously
identified
as
relevant
to
OCD
.

This
novel
model
of
OCD
demonstrates
that
drug
exposure
during
a
sensitive
period
can
program
disease
-
like
systems
permanently
,
which
could
have
implications
for
current
and
future
therapeutic
strategies
for
this
and
other
psychiatric
disorders
.

Late
recovery
of
renal
function
in
a
woman
with
the
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
.

A
case
is
reported
of
the
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome

(
HUS
)
in
a
woman
taking
oral
contraceptives
.

She
was
treated
with
heparin
,
dipyridamole
and
hemodialysis
;
and
after
more
than
three
months
,
her
urinary
output
rose
above
500
ml
;
and
six
months
after
the
onset
of
anuria
,
dialysis
treatment
was
stopped
.

This
case
emphasizes
the
possibility
that
HUS
in
adults
is
not
invariably
irreversible
and
that
,
despite
prolonged
oliguria
,
recovery
of
renal
function
can
be
obtained
.

Therefore
,
in
adult
patients
affected
by
HUS
,
dialysis

Effects
of
acetylsalicylic
acid
,
dipyridamole
,
and
hydrocortisone
on
epinephrine
-induced
myocardial
injury
in
dogs
.

A
reproducible
model
for
producing
diffuse
myocardial
injury

(
epinephrine
infusion
)
has
been
developed
to
study
the
cardioprotective
effects
of
agents
or
maneuvers
which
might
alter
the
evolution
of
acute
myocardial
infarction
.

Infusions
of
epinephrine

(
4
mug
per
kilogram
per
minute
for
6
hours
)
increased
radiocalcium
uptakes
into
intact
myocardium
and
each
of
its
subcellular
components
with
the
mitochondrial
fraction
showing
the
most
consistent
changes
when
compared
to
saline
-
infused
control
animals
(
4,957
vs.
827
counts
per
minute
per
gram
of
dried
tissue
or
fraction
)
.

Myocardial
concentrations
of
calcium
also
increased
significantly
(
12.0
vs.
5.0
mg.per
100
Gm
.
of
fat
-
free
dry
weight
)
.

Infusions
of
calcium
chloride
sufficient
to
raise
serum
calcium
concentrations
2
mEq
.

per
liter
failed
to
increase
calcium
influx
into
the
myocardial
cell
.

Mitochondrial
radiocalcium
uptakes
were
significantly
decreased
in
animals
pretreated
with
acetylsalicylic
acid
or
dipyridamole
or
when
hydrocortisone
was
added
to
the
epinephrine
infusion
(
2,682,2,803
,
and
3,424
counts
per
minute
per
gram
of
dried
fraction
,
respectively
)
.

Myocardial
calcium

concentrations
also
were
decreased
(
11.2
,
8.3
,
and
8.9
mg
.
per
100
Gm
.
of
fat
-
free
dry
weight
,
respectively
)
in
the
three
treatment
groups
,
being
significantly
decreased
only
in
the
last
two
.

Evidence
of
microscopic
damage
was
graded
as
less
severe
in
the
three
treatment
groups
.

Acetylsalicylic
acid
,
dipyridamole
,
and
hydrocortisone
all
appear
to
have
cardioprotective
effects
when
tested
in
this
model
.

Changes
in
depressive
status
associated
with
topical
beta
-
blockers
.

Depression
and
sexual
dysfunction
have
been
related
to
side
effects
of
topical
beta
-
blockers
.

We
performed
a
preliminary
study
in
order
to
determine
any
difference
between
a
non
selective
beta
-
blocker
(
timolol
)
and
a
selective
beta
-
blocker
(
betaxolol
)
regarding
CNS
side
effects
.

Eight
glaucomatous
patients
chronically
treated
with
timolol
0.5%/12h
,
suffering
from
depression
diagnosed
through
DMS
-
III
-
R
criteria
,
were
included
in
the
study
.

During
the
six
-
month
follow
up
,
depression
was
quantified
through
the
Beck
and
Zung
-
Conde
scales
every
two
months
.

In
a
double
blind
cross
-
over
study
with
control
group
,
the
patients
under
timolol
treatment
presented
higher
depression
values
measured
through
the
Beck
and
the
Zung
-
Conde
scales
(
p
0.001
vs
control
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
betaxolol
could
be
less
of
a
depression
-inducer
than
timolol
in
predisposed
patients
.

Long
-
term
follow

up
of
ifosfamide
renal
toxicity
in
children
treated
for
malignant
mesenchymal
tumors
:
an
International
Society
of
Pediatric
Oncology
report
.

The
renal
function
of
74
children
with
malignant
mesenchymal
tumors
in
complete
remission
and
who
have
received
the
same
ifosfamide
chemotherapy
protocol
(
International
Society
of
Pediatric
Oncology
Malignant
Mesenchymal
Tumor
Study
84
[
SIOP
MMT
84
]
)
were
studied
1
year
after
the
completion
of
treatment
.

Total
cumulative
doses
were
36
or
60
g
/
m2
of
ifosfamide

(
six
or
10
cycles
of
ifosfamide
,
vincristine
,
and
dactinomycin

[
IVA
]
)
.

None
of
them
had
received
cisplatin
chemotherapy
.

Ages
ranged
from
4
months
to
17
years
;
58
patients
were
males
and
42
females
.

The
most
common
primary
tumor
site
was
the
head
and
neck
.

Renal
function
was
investigated
by
measuring
plasma
and
urinary
electrolytes
,
glucosuria
,
proteinuria
,
aminoaciduria
,
urinary
pH
,
osmolarity
,
creatinine
clearance
,
phosphate
tubular
reabsorption
,
beta
2
microglobulinuria
,
and
lysozymuria
.

Fifty
-
eight
patients
(
78
%
)
had
normal
renal
tests
,
whereas
16
patients
(
22
%
)
had
renal
abnormalities
.

Two
subsets
of
patients
were
identified
from
this
latter
group
:
the
first
included
four
patients
(
5
%
of
the
total
population
)
who
developed
major
toxicity
resulting
in
Fanconi
's
syndrome

(
TDFS
)
;
and
the
second
group
included
five
patients
with
elevated
beta
2
microglobulinuria
and
low
phosphate
reabsorption
.

The
remaining
seven
patients
had
isolated
beta
2
microglobulinuria
.

Severe

toxicity
was
correlated
with
the
higher
cumulative
dose
of
60
g
/
m2
of
ifosfamide
,
a
younger
age
(
less
than
2
1/2
years
old
)
,
and
a
predominance
of
vesicoprostatic
tumor
involvement
.

This
low
percentage
(
5
%
)
of
TDFS
must
be
evaluated
with
respect
to
the
efficacy
of
ifosfamide
in
the
treatment
of
mesenchymal
tumors
in
children
.

Evidence
for
an
involvement
of
D1
and
D2
dopamine
receptors
in
mediating
nicotine
-induced

hyperactivity
in
rats
.

Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
repeated
exposure
of
rats
to
the
drug
or
to
the
experimental
environment
is
necessary
to
observe

nicotine
-induced
locomotor
stimulation
.

In
the
present
study
the
role
of
habituation
to
the
experimental
environment
on
the
stimulant
effect
of
nicotine
in
rats
was
examined
.

In
addition
,
the
role
of
dopamine
receptors
in
mediating
nicotine
-induced
locomotor
stimulation
was
investigated
by
examining
the
effects
of
selective
D1
and
D2
dopamine
receptor
antagonists
on
activity
induced
by
nicotine
.

Locomotor
activity
was
assessed
in
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
tested
in
photocell
cages
.

Nicotine
(
1.0
mg
/
kg
)
caused
a
significant
increase
in
locomotor
activity
in
rats
that
were
habituated
to
the
test
environment
,
but
had
only
a
weak
and
delayed
stimulant
action
in
rats
that
were
unfamiliar
with
the
test
environment
.

The
stimulant
action
of
nicotine
was
blocked
by
the
central
nicotinic
antagonist
mecamylamine
but
not
by
the
peripheral
nicotinic
blocker
hexamethonium
,
indicating
that
the
response
is
probably
mediated
by
central
nicotinic
receptors
.

Nicotine
-induced

hyperactivity
was
blocked
by
the
selective
D1
antagonist
SCH
23390
,
the
selective
D2
antagonist
raclopride
and
the
D1/D2
antagonist

fluphenazine
.

Pretreatment
with
the
D2
agonist

PHNO
enhanced

nicotine
-induced

hyperactivity
,
whereas
the
D1
agonist
SKF
38393
had
no
effect
.

The
results
indicate
that
acute
nicotine
injection
induces
a
pronounced
hyperactivity
in
rats
habituated
to
the
test
environment
.

The
effect
appears
to
be
mediated
by
central
nicotine
receptors
,
possibly
located
on
dopaminergic
neurons
,
and
also
requires
the
activation
of
both
D1
and
D2
dopamine
receptors
.

Neuropsychiatric
side
effects
after
the
use
of
mefloquine
.

This
study
describes
neuropsychiatric
side
effects
in
patients
after
treatment
with
mefloquine
.

Reactions
consisted
mainly
of
seizures
,
acute
psychoses
,
anxiety
neurosis
,
and
major
disturbances
of
sleep
-
wake
rhythm
.

Side
effects
occurred
after
both
therapeutic
and
prophylactic
intake
and
were
graded
from
moderate
to
severe
.

In
a
risk
analysis
of
neuropsychiatric
side
effects
in
Germany
,
it
is
estimated
that
one
of
8,000
mefloquine
users
suffers
from
such
reactions
.

The
incidence
calculation
revealed
that
one
of
215
therapeutic
users
had
reactions
,
compared
with
one
of
13,000
in
the
prophylaxis
group
,
making
the
risk
of
neuropsychiatric
reactions
after
mefloquine
treatment
60
times
higher
than
after
prophylaxis
.

Therefore
,
certain
limitations
for
malaria
prophylaxis
and
treatment
with

mefloquine
are
recommended
.

Reduction
in
injection
pain
using
buffered
lidocaine
as
a
local
anesthetic
before
cardiac
catheterization
.

Previous
reports
have
suggested
that
pain
associated
with
the
injection
of
lidocaine
is
related
to
the
acidic
pH
of
the
solution
.

To
determine
if
the
addition
of
a
buffering
solution
to
adjust
the
pH
of
lidocaine
into
the
physiologic
range
would
reduce
pain
during
injection
,
we
performed
a
blinded
randomized
study
in
patients
undergoing
cardiac
catheterization
.

Twenty
patients
were
asked
to
quantify
the
severity
of
pain
after
receiving
standard
lidocaine
in
one
femoral
area
and
buffered
lidocaine
in
the
opposite
femoral
area
.

The
mean
pain
score
for
buffered

lidocaine
was
significantly
lower
than
the
mean
score
for
standard
lidocaine

(
2.7
+
/-
1.9
vs.
3.8
+
/-

2.2
,
P
=
0.03
)
.

The
pH
adjustment
of
standard
lidocaine
can
be
accomplished
easily
in
the
catheterization
laboratory
before
injection
and
results
in
a
reduction
of
the
pain
occurring
during
the
infiltration
of
tissues
.

Randomized
,
double
-
blind
trial
of
mazindol
in
Duchenne
dystrophy
.

There
is
evidence
that
growth
hormone
may
be
related
to
the
progression
of
weakness
in
Duchenne
dystrophy
.

We
conducted
a
12-month
controlled
trial
of
mazindol
,
a
putative
growth
hormone
secretion
inhibitor
,
in
83
boys
with
Duchenne
dystrophy
.

Muscle
strength
,
contractures
,
functional
ability
and
pulmonary
function
were
tested
at
baseline
,
and
6
and
12
months
after
treatment
with
mazindol

(
3
mg
/
d
)
or
placebo
.

The
study
was
designed
to
have
a
power
of
greater
than
0.90
to
detect
a
slowing
to
25
%
of
the
expected
rate
of
progression
of
weakness
at
P
less
than
0.05
.

Mazindol
did
not
benefit
strength
at
any
point
in
the
study
.

Side
effects
attributable
to
mazindol
included
decreased
appetite
(
36
%
)
,
dry
mouth

(
10
%
)
,
behavioral
change
(
22
%
)
,
and
gastrointestinal
symptoms
(
18
%
)
;
mazindol
dosage
was
reduced
in
43
%
of
patients
.

The
effect
of
mazindol
on
GH
secretion
was
estimated
indirectly
by
comparing
the
postabsorptive
IGF
-
I
levels
obtained
following
3
,
6
,
9
,
and
12
months
in
the
mazindol
treated
to
those
in
the
placebo
groups
.

Although
mazindol
-treated
patients
gained
less
weight
and
height
than
placebo
-
treated
patients
,
no
significant
effect
on
IGF
-
I
levels
was
observed
.

Mazindol
doses
not
slow
the
progression
of
weakness
in
Duchenne
dystrophy
.

Pentoxifylline
(
Trental
)
does
not
inhibit

dipyridamole
-induced

coronary
hyperemia
:
implications
for
dipyridamole
-
thallium

-201
myocardial
imaging
.

Dipyridamole
-
thallium

-201
imaging
is
often
performed
in
patients
unable
to
exercise
because
of
peripheral
vascular
disease
.

Many
of
these
patients
are
taking
pentoxifylline

(
Trental
)
,
a
methylxanthine
derivative
which
may
improve
intermittent
claudication
.

Whether
pentoxifylline
inhibits

dipyridamole
-induced
coronary
hyperemia
like
other
methylxanthines
such
as
theophylline
and
should
be
stopped
prior
to
dipyridamole
-
thallium

-201
imaging
is
unknown
.

Therefore
,
we
studied
the
hyperemic
response
to
dipyridamole
in
seven
open
-
chest
anesthetized
dogs
after
pretreatment
with
either
pentoxifylline

(
0
,
7.5
,
or
15
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)
or
theophylline
(
3
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)
.

Baseline
circumflex
coronary
blood
flows
did
not
differ
significantly
among
treatment
groups
.

Dipyridamole
significantly
increased
coronary
blood
flow
before
and
after
7.5
or
15
mm
/
kg
i.v
.

pentoxifylline

(
p
less
than
0.002
)
.

Neither
dose
of
pentoxifylline
significantly
decreased
the

dipyridamole
-induced

hyperemia
,
while
peak
coronary
blood
flow
was
significantly
lower
after
theophylline

(
p
less
than
0.01
)
.

We
conclude
that
pentoxyifylline
does
not
inhibit
dipyridamole
-induced
coronary
hyperemia
even
at
high
doses
.

Cause
of
death
among
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease
:
a
rare
mortality
due
to
cerebral
haemorrhage
.

Causes
of
death
,
with
special
reference
to
cerebral
haemorrhage
,
among
240
patients
with
pathologically
verified
Parkinson
's
disease
were
investigated
using
the
Annuals
of
the
Pathological
Autopsy
Cases
in
Japan
from
1981
to
1985
.

The
leading
causes
of
death
were
pneumonia
and
bronchitis
(
44.1
%
)
,
malignant
neoplasms
(
11.6
%
)
,
heart
diseases
(
4.1
%
)
,
cerebral
infarction
(
3.7
%
)
and
septicaemia
(
3.3
%
)
.

Cerebral
haemorrhage
was
the
11th
most
frequent
cause
of
death
,
accounting
for
only
0.8
%
of
deaths
among
the
patients
,
whereas
it
was
the
5th
most
common
cause
of
death
among
the
Japanese
general
population
in
1985
.

The
low
incidence
of
cerebral
haemorrhage
as
a
cause
of
death
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease
may
reflect
the
hypotensive
effect
of
levodopa
and
a
hypotensive
mechanism
due
to
reduced
noradrenaline
levels
in
the
parkinsonian
brain
.

Tolerance
and
antiviral
effect
of
ribavirin
in
patients
with
Argentine
hemorrhagic
fever
.

Tolerance
and
antiviral
effect
of
ribavirin
was
studied
in
6
patients
with
Argentine
hemorrhagic
fever

(
AHF
)
of
more
than
8
days
of
evolution
.

Administration
of
ribavirin
resulted
in
a
neutralization
of
viremia
and
a
drop
of
endogenous
interferon
titers
.

The
average
time
of
death
was
delayed
.

A
reversible
anemia
was
the
only
adverse
effect
observed
.

From
these
results
,
we
conclude
that
ribavirin
has
an
antiviral
effect
in
advanced
cases
of
AHF
,
and
that
anemia
,
the
only
secondary
reaction
observed
,
can
be
easily
managed
.

The
possible
beneficial
effect
of
ribavirin
during
the
initial
days
of
AHF
is
discussed
.

Dipyridamole
-induced
myocardial
ischemia
.

Angina
and
ischemic
electrocardiographic
changes
occurred
after
administration
of
oral
dipyridamole
in
four
patients
awaiting
urgent
myocardial
revascularization
procedures
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
has
not
previously
been
reported
as
a
side
effect
of
preoperative
dipyridamole
therapy
,
although
dipyridamole
-induced

myocardial
ischemia
has
been
demonstrated
to
occur
in
animals
and
humans
with
coronary
artery
disease
.

Epicardial
coronary
collateral
vessels
were
demonstrated
in
all
four
patients
;
a
coronary
"
steal
"
phenomenon
may
be
the
mechanism
of
the
dipyridamole
-induced

ischemia
observed
.

Inhibition
of
immunoreactive
corticotropin
-
releasing
factor
secretion
into
the
hypophysial
-
portal
circulation
by
delayed
glucocorticoid
feedback
.

Nitroprusside
-induced

hypotension
evokes
ACTH
secretion
which
is
primarily
mediated
by
enhanced
secretion
of
immunoreactive
corticotropin
-
releasing
factor
(
irCRF
)
into
the
hypophysial
-
portal
circulation
.

Portal
plasma
concentrations
of
neither
arginine
vasopressin
nor
oxytocin
are
significantly
altered
in
this
paradigm
.

Application
of
a
delayed
feedback
signal
,
in
the
form
of
a
2-h
systemic
corticosterone
infusion
in
urethane
-anesthetized
rats
with
pharmacological
blockade
of
glucocorticoid
synthesis
,
is
without
effect
on
the
resting
secretion
of
arginine
vasopressin
and
oxytocin
at
any
corticosterone
feedback
dose
tested
.

Resting
irCRF
levels
are
suppressed
only
at
the
highest
corticosterone
infusion
rate
,
which
resulted
in
systemic
corticosterone
levels
of
40
micrograms
/
dl
.

Suppression
of
irCRF
secretion
in
response
to
nitroprusside
-induced

hypotension
is
observed
and
occurs
at
a
plasma
corticosterone
level
between
8
-
12
micrograms
/
dl
.

These
studies
provide
further
evidence
for
a
strong
central
component
of
the
delayed
feedback
process
which
is
mediated
by
modulation
of
irCRF
release
.

Noradrenergic
involvement

catalepsy
induced
by
delta
9-tetrahydrocannabinol
.

In
order
to
elucidate
the
role
of
the
catecholaminergic
system
in
the
cataleptogenic
effect
of
delta
9-tetrahydrocannabinol

(
THC
)
,
the
effect
of
pretreatment
with
6-hydroxydopamine

(
6-OHDA
)
or
with
desipramine

6-OHDA
and
lesions
of
the
locus
coeruleus
were
investigated
in
rats
.

The
cataleptogenic
effect
of
THC
was
significantly
reduced
in
rats
treated
with
6-OHDA
and
in
rats
with
lesions
of
the
locus
coeruleus
but
not
in
rats
treated
with
desipramine
and
6-OHDA
,
as
compared
with
control
rats
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
cataleptogenic
effect
of
haloperidol
was
significantly
reduced
in
rats
treated
with
desipramine
and
6-OHDA
but
not
in
rats
treated
with
6-OHDA
or
in
rats
with
lesions
of
the
locus
coeruleus
.

These
results
indicate
that
noradrenergic
neurons
have
an
important
role
in
the
manifestation
of
catalepsy
induced
by
THC
,
whereas
dopaminergic
neurons
are
important
in
catalepsy
induced
by
haloperidol
.

Intracranial
pressure
increases
during
alfentanil

-induced

rigidity
.

Intracranial
pressure
(
ICP
)
was
measured
during
alfentanil
-induced

rigidity
in
rats
.

Ten
rats
had
arterial
,
central
venous
(
CVP
)
,
and
subdural
cannulae
inserted
under
halothane
anesthesia
.

The
animals
were
mechanically
ventilated
to
achieve
normocarbia

(
PCO2
=
42
+
/-

1
mmHg
,
mean
+
/-
SE
)
.

Following
instrumentation
,
halothane
was
discontinued
and
alfentanil
(
125
mu
/
kg
)
administered
iv
during
emergence
from
halothane
anesthesia
.

In
the
five
rats
that
developed
somatic
rigidity
,
ICP
and
CVP
increased
significantly
above
baseline
(
delta
ICP
7.5
+
/-

1.0
mmHg
,
delta
CVP
5.9
+
/-

1.3
mmHg
)
.

These
variables
returned
to
baseline
when
rigidity
was
abolished
with
metocurine
.

In
five
rats
that
did
not
become
rigid
,
ICP
and
CVP
did
not
change
following
alfentanil
.

These
observations
suggest
that
rigidity
should
be
prevented
when
alfentanil
,
and
,
presumably
,
other
opiates
,
are
used
in
the
anesthetic
management
of
patients
with
ICP
problems
.

Adverse
cardiac
effects
during
induction
chemotherapy
treatment
with
cis
-
platin
and
5-fluorouracil
.

Survival
for
patients
with
advanced
head
and
neck
carcinoma
and
esophageal
carcinoma
is
poor
with
radiotherapy
and/or
surgery
.

Obviously
,
there
is
a
need
for
effective
chemotherapy
.

In
the
present
study
,
cis
-
platin
(
80
-
120
mg
/
m2BSA
)
and
5-FU

(
1000
mg
/
m2BSA
daily
as
a
continuous
infusion
during
5
days
)
were
given
to
76
patients
before
radiotherapy
and
surgery
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
clarify
the
incidence
and
severity
of
adverse
cardiac
effects
to
this
treatment
.

Before
treatment
all
patients
had
a
cardiac
evaluation
and
during
treatment
serial
ECG
recordings
were
performed
.

In
the
pre
-
treatment
evaluation
,
signs
of
cardiovascular
disease
were
found
in
33
patients
(
43
%
)
.

During
treatment
,
adverse
cardiac
effects
were
observed
in
14
patients
(
18
%
)
.

The
mean
age
of
these
patients
was
the
same
as
for
the
entire
group
,
64
years
.

The
incidence
of
cardiotoxicity
was
not
higher
in
patients
with
signs
of
cardiovascular
disease
than
in
those
without
in
the
pre
-
treatment
evaluation
.

The
most
common
signs
of
cardiotoxicity
were
chest
pain
,
ST
-
T
wave
changes
and
atrial
fibrillation
.

This
was
followed
by
ventricular
fibrillation
in
one
patient
and
sudden
death
in
another
.

It
is
concluded
that
patients
on
5-FU
treatment
should
be
under
close
supervision
and
that
the
treatment
should
be
discontinued
if
chest
pain
or
tachyarrhythmia
is
observed
.

Verapamil
-induced
carbamazepine
neurotoxicity
.

A
report
of
two
cases
.

Two
patients
with
signs
of
carbamazepine

neurotoxicity
after
combined
treatment
with
verapamil
showed
complete
recovery
after
discontinuation
of
the
calcium
entry
blocker
.

Use
of
verapamil
in
combination
with
carbamazepine
should
either
be
avoided
or
prescribed
only
with
appropriate
adjustment
of
the
carbamazepine
dose
(
usually
reduction
of
the
carbamazepine
dose
by
one
half
)
.

Serial
studies
of
auditory
neurotoxicity
in
patients
receiving
deferoxamine
therapy
.

Visual
and
auditory
neurotoxicity
was
previously
documented
in
42
of
89
patients
with
transfusion
-
dependent
anemia
who
were
receiving
iron
chelation
therapy
with
daily
subcutaneous
deferoxamine
.

Twenty
-
two
patients
in
the
affected
group
had
abnormal
audiograms
with
deficits
mostly
in
the
high
frequency
range
of
4,000
to
8,000
Hz
and
in
the
hearing
threshold
levels
of
30
to
100
decibels
.

When
deferoxamine
therapy
was
discontinued
and
serial
studies
were
performed
,
audiograms
in
seven
cases
reverted
to
normal
or
near
normal
within
two
to
three
weeks
,
and
nine
of
13
patients
with
symptoms
became
asymptomatic
.

Audiograms
from
15
patients
remained
abnormal
and
four
patients
required
hearing
aids
because
of
permanent
disability
.

Since
18
of
the
22
patients
were
initially
receiving
deferoxamine
doses
in
excess
of
the
commonly
recommended
50
mg
/
kg
per
dose
,
therapy
was
restarted
with
lower
doses
,
usually
50
mg
/
kg
per
dose
or
less
depending
on
the
degree
of
auditory
abnormality
,
and
with
the
exception
of
two
cases
no
further

toxicity
was
demonstrated
.

Auditory
deterioration
and
improvement
,
demonstrated
serially
in
individual
patients
receiving
and
not
receiving
deferoxamine
,
respectively
,
provided
convincing
evidence
for
a
cause
-
and
-
effect
relation
between
deferoxamine
administration
and
ototoxicity
.

Based
on
these
data
,
a
plan
of
management
was
developed
that
allows
effective
yet
safe
administration
of
deferoxamine
.

A
dose
of
50
mg
/
kg
is
recommended
in
those
without
audiogram
abnormalities
.

With
mild
toxicity
,
a
reduction
to
30
or
40
mg
/
kg
per
dose
should
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
abnormal
results
to
normal
within
four
weeks
.

Moderate
abnormalities
require
a
reduction
of
deferoxamine
to
25
mg
/
kg
per
dose
with
careful
monitoring
.

In
those
with
symptoms
of
hearing
loss
,
the
drug
should
be
stopped
for
four
weeks
,
and
when
the
audiogram
is
stable
or
improved
,
therapy
should
be
restarted
at
10
to
25
mg
/
kg
per
dose
.

Serial
audiograms
should
be
performed
every
six
months
in
those
without
problems
and
more
frequently
in
young
patients
with
normal
serum
ferritin
values
and
in
those
with
auditory
dysfunction
.

Flurbiprofen
in
the
treatment
of
juvenile
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Thirty
-
four
patients
with
juvenile
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
who
were
treated
with
flurbiprofen
at
a
maximum
dose
of
4
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
had
statistically
significant
decreases
from
baseline
in
6
arthritis
indices
after
12
weeks
of
treatment
.

Improvements
were
seen
in
the
number
of
tender
joints
,
the
severity
of
swelling
and
tenderness
,
the
time
of
walk
50
feet
,
the
duration
of
morning
stiffness
and
the
circumference
of
the
left
knee
.

The
most
frequently
observed
side
effect
was
fecal
occult
blood

(
25
%
of
patients
)
;
however
,
there
was
no
other
evidence
of
gastrointestinal
(
GI
)
bleeding
in
these
patients
.

One
patient
was
prematurely
discontinued
from
the
study
for
severe
headache
and
abdominal
pain
.

Most
side
effects
were
mild
and
related
to
the
GI
tract
.

The
correlation
between
neurotoxic
esterase
inhibition
and
mipafox
-induced
neuropathic
damage
in
rats
.

The
correlation
between
neuropathic
damage
and
inhibition
of
neurotoxic
esterase
or
neuropathy
target
enzyme
(
NTE
)
was
examined
in
rats
acutely
exposed
to
Mipafox

(
N
,
N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate
)
,
a
neurotoxic
organophosphate
.

Brain
and
spinal
cord
NTE
activities
were
measured
in
Long
-
Evans
male
rats
1
hr
post
-
exposure
to
various
dosages
of
Mipafox

(
ip
,
1
-
15
mg
/
kg
)
.

These
data
were
correlated
with
histologically
scored
cervical
cord
damage
in
a
separate
group
of
similarly
dosed
rats
sampled
14
-
21
days
post
-
exposure
.

Those
dosages
(
greater
than
or
equal
to
10
mg
/
kg
)
that
inhibited
mean
NTE
activity
in
the
spinal
cord
greater
than
or
equal
to
73
%
and
brain
greater
than
or
equal
to
67
%
of
control
values
produced
severe
(
greater
than
or
equal
to
3
)
cervical
cord
pathology
in
85
%
of
the
rats
.

In
contrast
,
dosages
of
Mipafox

(
less
than
or
equal
to
5
mg
/
kg
)
which
inhibited
mean
NTE
activity
in
spinal
cord
less
than
or
equal
to
61
%
and
brain
less
than
or
equal
to
60
%
produced
this
degree
of
cord
damage
in
only
9
%
of
the
animals
.

These
data
indicate
that
a
critical
percentage
of
NTE
inhibition
in
brain
and
spinal
cord
sampled
shortly
after
Mipafox
exposure
can
predict
neuropathic
damage
in
rats
several
weeks
later
.

Cerebral
infarction
with
a
single
oral
dose
of
phenylpropanolamine
.

Phenylpropanolamine
(
PPA
)
,
a
synthetic
sympathomimetic
that
is
structurally
similar
to
amphetamine
,
is
available
over
the
counter
in
anorectics
,
nasal
congestants
,
and
cold
preparations
.

Its
prolonged
use
or
overuse
has
been
associated
with
seizures
,
intracerebral
hemorrhage
,
neuropsychiatric
symptoms
,
and
nonhemorrhagic
cerebral
infarction
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
young
woman
who
suffered
a
cerebral
infarction
after
taking
a
single
oral
dose
of
PPA
.

Treatment
of
psoriasis
with
azathioprine
.

Azathioprine
treatment
benefited
19
(
66
%
)
out
of
29
patients
suffering
from
severe
psoriasis
.

Haematological
complications
were
not
troublesome
and
results
of
biochemical
liver
function
tests
remained
normal
.

Minimal
cholestasis
was
seen
in
two
cases
and
portal
fibrosis
of
a
reversible
degree
in
eight
.

Liver
biopsies
should
be
undertaken
at
regular
intervals
if
azathioprine
therapy
is
continued
so
that
structural
liver
damage
may
be
detected
at
an
early
and
reversible
stage
.

Maternal
lithium
and
neonatal
Ebstein
's
anomaly
:
evaluation
with
cross
-
sectional
echocardiography
.

Cross
-
sectional
echocardiography
was
used
to
evaluate
two
neonates
whose
mothers
ingested
lithium
during
pregnancy
.

In
one
infant
,
Ebstein
's
anomaly
of
the
tricuspid
valve
was
identified
.

In
the
other
infant
cross
-
sectional
echocardiography
provided
reassurance
that
the
infant
did
not
have
Ebstein
's
anomaly
.

Cross
-
sectional
echocardiographic
screening
of
newborns
exposed
to
lithium
during
gestation
can
provide
highly
accurate
,
noninvasive
assessment
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
lithium

-induced

cardiac
malformations
.

Effects
of
training
on
the
extent
of
experimental
myocardial
infarction
in
aging
rats
.

The
effects
of
exercise
on
the
severity
of

isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
infarction
were
studied
in
female
albino
rats
of
20,40,60
and
80
weeks
of
age
.

The
rats
were
trained
to
swim
for
a
specific
duration
and
for
a
particular
period
.

The
occurrence
of
infarcts
were
confirmed
by
histological
methods
.

Elevations
in
the
serum
GOT
and
GPT
were
maximum
in
the
sedentary-
isoproterenols
and
minimum
in
the
exercise
-
controls
.

These
changes
in
the
serum
transaminases
were
associated
with
corresponding
depletions
in
the
cardiac
GOT
and
GPT
.

However
,
age
was
seen
to
interfere
with
the
responses
exhibited
by
the
young
and
old
rats
.

Studies
dealing
with
myocardial
infarction
are
more
informative
when
dealt
with
age
.

Effect
of
polyethylene
glycol
400
on
adriamycin
toxicity
in
mice
.

The
effect
of
a
widely
used
organic
solvent
,
polyethylene
glycol
400

(
PEG
400
)
,
on
the
toxic
action
of
an
acute
or
chronic
treatment
with
adriamycin

(
ADR
)
was
evaluated
in
mice
.

PEG
400
impressively
decreased
both
acute
high
-
dose
and
chronic
low
-
dose-
ADR
-associated
lethality
.

Light
microscopic
analysis
showed
a
significant
protection
against
ADR

-induced

cardiac
morphological
alterations
.

Such
treatment
did
not
diminish
the
ADR
antitumor
activity
in
L1210
leukemia
and
in
Ehrlich
ascites
tumor
.

Intra
-
arterial

BCNU
chemotherapy
for
treatment
of
malignant
gliomas
of
the
central
nervous
system
.

Because
of
the
rapid
systemic
clearance
of
BCNU

(
1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea
)
,

intra
-
arterial
administration
should
provide
a
substantial
advantage
over
intravenous
administration
for
the
treatment
of
malignant
gliomas
.

Thirty
-
six
patients
were
treated
with
BCNU
every
6
to
8
weeks
,
either
by
transfemoral
catheterization
of
the
internal
carotid
or
vertebral
artery
or
through
a
fully
implantable
intracarotid
drug
delivery
system
,
beginning
with
a
dose
of
200
mg
/
sq
m
body
surface
area
.

Twelve
patients
with
Grade
III
or
IV
astrocytomas
were
treated
after
partial
resection
of
the
tumor
without
prior
radiation
therapy
.

After
two
to
seven
cycles
of
chemotherapy
,
nine
patients
showed
a
decrease
in
tumor
size
and
surrounding
edema
on
contrast
-
enhanced
computerized
tomography
scans
.

In
the
nine
responders
,
median
duration
of
chemotherapy
response
from
the
time
of
operation
was
25
weeks
(
range
12
to
more
than
91
weeks
)
.

The
median
duration
of
survival
in
the
12
patients
was
54
weeks
(
range
21
to
more
than
156
weeks
)
,
with
an
18-month
survival
rate
of
42
%
.

Twenty
-
four
patients
with
recurrent
Grade
I
to
IV
astrocytomas
,
whose
resection
and
irradiation
therapy
had
failed
,
received
two
to
eight
courses
of
intra
-
arterial
BCNU
therapy
.

Seventeen
of
these
had
a
response
or
were
stable
for
a
median
of
20
weeks
(
range
6
to
more
than
66
weeks
)
.

The
catheterization
procedure
is
safe
,
with
no
immediate
complication
in
111
infusions
of
BCNU
.

A
delayed
complication
in
nine
patients
has
been
unilateral
loss
of
vision
secondary
to
a
retinal
vasculitis
.

The
frequency
of
visual
loss
decreased
after
the
concentration
of
the
ethanol
diluent
was
lowered
.

Blood
pressure
response
to
chronic
low
-
dose
intrarenal
noradrenaline
infusion
in
conscious
rats
.

Sodium
chloride
solution
(
0.9
%
)
or
noradrenaline
in
doses
of
4
,
12
and
36
micrograms
h-1
kg-1
was
infused
for
five
consecutive
days
,
either
intrarenally
(
by
a
new
technique
)
or
intravenously
into
rats
with
one
kidney
removed
.

Intrarenal
infusion
of
noradrenaline
caused

hypertension
at
doses
which
did
not
do
so
when
infused
intravenously
.

Intrarenal
compared
with
intravenous
infusion
of
noradrenaline
caused
higher
plasma
noradrenaline
concentrations
and
a
shift
of
the
plasma
noradrenaline
concentration
-
blood
pressure
effect
curve
towards
lower
plasma
noradrenaline
levels
.

These
results
suggest
that
hypertension
after
chronic
intrarenal
noradrenaline
infusion
is
produced
by
relatively
higher
levels
of
circulating
noradrenaline
and
by
triggering
of
an
additional
intrarenal
pressor
mechanism
.

Age
and
renal
clearance
of
cimetidine
.

In
35
patients
(
ages
20
to
86
yr
)
receiving
cimetidine

therapeutically
two
serum
samples
and
all
urine
formed
in
the
interim
were
collected
for
analysis
of
cimetidine
by
high
-
pressure
liquid
chromatography
and
for
creatinine
.

Cimetidine
clearance
decreased
with
age
.

The
extrapolated
6-hr
serum
concentration
of
cimetidine
per
unit
dose
,
after
intravenous
cimetidine
,
increased
with
age
of
the
patients
.

The
ratio
of
cimetidine
clearance
to
creatinine
clearance
(
Rc
)
averaged
4.8
+
/-

2.0
,
indicating
net
tubular
secretion
for
cimetidine
.

Rc
seemed
to
be
independent
of
age
and
decreased
with
increasing
serum
concentration
of
cimetidine
,
suggesting
that
secretion
of
cimetidine
is
a
saturable
process
.

There
was
only
one
case
of
dementia
possibly
due
to
cimetidine
(
with
a
drug
level
of
1.9
microgram
/
ml
6
hr
after
a
dose
)
in
a
group
of
13
patients
without
liver
or
kidney
disease
who
had
cimetidine
levels
above
1.25
microgram
/
ml
.

Thus
,
high
cimetidine
levels
alone
do
not
always
induce
dementia
.

Development
of
clear
cell
adenocarcinoma
in
DES
-exposed
offspring
under
observation
.

Two
cases
of
clear
cell
adenocarcinoma
of
the
vagina
detected
at
follow
-
up
in
young
women
exposed
in
utero
to
diethylstilbestrol
are
reported
.

One
patient
,
aged
23
,
had
been
followed
for
2
years
before
carcinoma
was
diagnosed
;
the
second
patient
,
aged
22
,
had
been
seen
on
a
regular
basis
for
5
years
,
8
months
.

In
both
instances
,
suspicion
of
the
presence
of
carcinoma
was
aroused
by
the
palpation
of
a
small
nodule
in
the
vaginal
fornix
.

Hysterosalpingography
was
performed
on
both
patients
and
,
in
1
instance
,
an
abnormal
x
-
ray
film
was
reflected
by
the
gross
appearance
of
the
uterine
cavity
found
in
the
surgical
specimen
.

Phenobarbitone
-induced
enlargement
of
the
liver
in
the
rat
:
its
relationship
to
carbon
tetrachloride
-induced
cirrhosis
.

The
yield
of
severe
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
(
defined
as
a
shrunken
finely
nodular
liver
with
micronodular
histology
,
ascites
greater
than
30
ml
,
plasma
albumin
less
than
2.2
g
/
dl
,
splenomegaly
2
-
3
times
normal
,
and
testicular

atrophy

half
normal
weight
)
after
12
doses
of
carbon
tetrachloride

given
intragastrically
in
the
phenobarbitone

-primed

rat
was
increased
from
25
%
to
56
%
by
giving
the
initial
"
calibrating
"
dose
of
carbon
tetrachloride
at
the
peak
of
the
phenobarbitone
-induced
enlargement
of
the
liver
.

At
this
point
it
was
assumed
that
the
cytochrome
P450/
CCl4
toxic
state
was
both
maximal
and
stable
.

The
optimal
rat
size
to
begin
phenobarbitone
was
determined
as
100
g
,
and
this
size
as
a
group
had
a
mean
maximum
relative
liver
weight
increase
47
%
greater
than
normal
rats
of
the
same
body
weight
.

The
optimal
time
for
the
initial
dose
of
carbon
tetrachloride
was
after
14
days
on
phenobarbitone
.

Attenuation
of
the
lithium
-induced
diabetes
-
insipidus
-
like
syndrome
by
amiloride
in
rats
.

The
effect
of
amiloride
on
lithium
-induced
polydipsia
and
polyuria
and
on
the
lithium
concentration
in
the
plasma
,
brain
,
kidney
,
thyroid
and
red
blood
cells
was
investigated
in
rats
,
chronically
treated
with
LiCl
.

Amiloride
reduced
the
drinking
and
urine
volume
of
rats
in
an
acute
(
6
or
12
h
)
and
a
subacute
(
3
days
)
experiment
.

6
h
after
the
administration
of
amiloride
,
a
reduction
was
observed
in
the
lithium
content
of
the
renal
medulla
but
not
in
the
other
organs
studied
.

At
12
h
,
all
the
tissues
showed
a
slight
increase
in
lithium
levels
.

After
3
days
of
combined
treatment
,
a
marked
elevation
in
plasma
and
tissue
lithium
levels
accompanied
a
reduction
in
water
intake
.

In
all
the
experiments
,
the
attenuation
of
the
lithium
-induced

diabetes
-
insipidus
-
like
syndrome
by

amiloride
was
accompanied
by
a
reduction
of
the
ratio
between
the
lithium
concentration
in
the
renal
medulla
and
its
levels
in
the
blood
and
an
elevation
in
the
plasma
potassium
level
.

It
is
concluded

that
acute
amiloride
administration
to
lithium
-treated
patients
suffering
from
polydipsia
and
polyuria
might
relieve
these
patients
but
prolonged
amiloride
supplementation
would
result
in
elevated
lithium
levels
and
might
be
hazardous
.

Safety
and
side
-
effects
of
alprazolam
.

Controlled
study
in
agoraphobia
with
panic
disorder
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
widespread
use
of
benzodiazepines
has
led
to
increasing
recognition
of
their
unwanted
effects
.

The
efficacy
of
alprazolam
and
placebo
in
panic
disorder
with
agoraphobia
,
and
the
side
-
effect
and
adverse
effect
profiles
of
both
drug
groups
were
measured
.

METHOD
:

In
London
and
Toronto
154
patients
who
met
DSM
-
III
criteria
for
panic
disorder
with
agoraphobia
were
randomised
to
alprazolam
or
placebo
.

Subjects
in
each
drug
group
also
received
either
exposure
or
relaxation
.

Treatment
was
from
weeks
0
to
8
and
was
then
tapered
from
weeks
8
to
16
.

RESULTS
:

Mean
alprazolam
dose
was
5
mg
daily
.

Compared
with
placebo
subjects
,
alprazolam
patients
developed
more
adverse
reactions
(
21
%
v.
0
%
)
of
depression
,
enuresis
,
disinhibition
and
aggression
;
and
more
side
-
effects
,
particularly
sedation
,
irritability
,
impaired
memory
,
weight
loss
and
ataxia
.

Side
-
effects
tended
to
diminish
during
treatment
but
remained
significant
at
week
8
.

Despite
this
,
the
drop
-
out
rate
was
low
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Alprazolam
caused
side
-
effects
and
adverse
effects
during
treatment
but
many
patients
were
willing
to
accept
these
.

Dup
753
prevents
the
development
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside

-induced

nephrosis
.

The
appearance
of
nephrotic
syndromes
such
as
proteinuria
,
hypoalbuminemia
,
hypercholesterolemia
and
increase
in
blood
nitrogen
urea
,
induced
in
rats
by
injection
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside
was
markedly
inhibited
by
oral
administration
of
Dup
753

(
losartan
)
,
a
novel
angiotensin
II
receptor
antagonist
,
at
a
dose
of
1
or
2
mg
/
kg
per
day
.

The
results
suggest
a
possible
involvement
of
the
renin-
angiotensin
system
in
the
development
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced
nephrosis
.

Sodium
bicarbonate
alleviates
penile
pain
induced
by
intracavernous
injections
for
erectile
dysfunction
.

In
an
attempt
to
determine
whether
penile
pain
associated
with
intracorporeal
injections
could
be
due
to
the
acidity
of
the
medication
,
we
performed
a
randomized
study
comparing
the
incidence
of
penile
pain
following
intracorporeal
injections
with
or
without
the
addition
of
sodium
bicarbonate
to
the
intracorporeal
medications
.

A
total
of
38
consecutive
patients
who
presented
to
our
clinic
with
impotence
received
0.2
ml
.
of
a
combination
of
3
drugs
:
6
mg
.

papaverine
,
100
micrograms
.

phentolamine
and
10
micrograms
.

prostaglandin
E1
with
(
pH
7.05
)
or
without
(
pH
4.17
)

the
addition
of
sodium
bicarbonate

(
0.03
mEq
.
)
.

Of
the
19
patients
without
sodium
bicarbonate
added
to
the
medication
11
(
58
%
)
complained
of
penile
pain
due
to
the
medication
,
while
only
1
of
the
19
men
(
5
%
)
who
received
sodium
bicarbonate
complained
of
penile
pain
.

From
these
data
we
conclude
that
the
penile
pain

following
intracorporeal
injections
is
most
likely
due
to
the
acidity
of
the
medication
,
which
can
be
overcome
by
elevating
the
pH
to
a
neutral
level
.

Prospective
study
of
the
long
-
term
effects
of
somatostatin
analog
(
octreotide
)
on
gallbladder
function
and
gallstone
formation
in
Chinese
acromegalic
patients
.

This
article
reports
the
changes
in
gallbladder
function
examined
by
ultrasonography
in
20
Chinese
patients
with
active
acromegaly
treated
with
sc
injection
of
the
somatostatin
analog
octreotide
in
dosages
of
300
-
1500
micrograms
/
day
for
a
mean
of
24.2
+
/-

13.9
months
.

During
treatment
with
octreotide
,
17
patients
developed
sludge
,
10
had
gallstones
,
and
1
developed

acute
cholecystitis
requiring
surgery
.

In
all
of
7
patients
examined
acutely
,
gallbladder
contractility
was
inhibited
after
a
single
100-micrograms
injection
.

In
8
patients
followed
for
24
weeks
,
gallbladder
contractility
remained
depressed
throughout
therapy
.

After
withdrawal
of
octreotide
in
10
patients
without
gallstones
,
8
patients
assessed
had
return
of
normal
gallbladder
contractility
within
1
month
.

In
8
of
the
remaining
10
patients
who
developed
gallstones
during
treatment
,
gallbladder
contractility
normalized
in
5
patients
(
3
of
whom
has
disappearance
of
their
stones
within
3
weeks
)
,
and
remained

depressed
in
3
(
2
of
whom
had
stones
present
at
6
months
)
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
suppression
of
gallbladder
contractility
is
the
cause
of
the
successive
formation
of
bile
sludge
,
gallstones
,
and
cholecystitis
during
octreotide
therapy
in
Chinese
acromegalic
patients
.

It
is
therefore
very
important
to
follow
the
changes
of
gallbladder
function
during
long
-
term
octreotide
therapy
of
acromegalic
patients
.

Improvement
of
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesia
by
propranolol
in
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Seven
patients
suffering
from
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
with
severely
disabling

dyskinesia
received
low
-
dose
propranolol
as
an
adjunct
to
the
currently
used
medical
treatment
.

There
was
a
significant
40
%
improvement
in
the
dyskinesia
score
without
increase
of
parkinsonian
motor
disability
.

Ballistic
and
choreic
dyskinesia
were
markedly
ameliorated
,
whereas
dystonia
was
not
.

This
study
suggests
that
administration
of
low
doses
of
beta
-
blockers
may
improve
levodopa
-induced
ballistic
and
choreic
dyskinesia
in
PD
.

Morphological

intragastric
application
of
the
antiepileptic
drug
sodium

"
)
at
the
effective
dose
of
200
mg
/

once
daily
to
rats
for
1
,
3
,
6
,
9
and
12
months
revealed
neurological
disorders

indicating
cerebellum
damage

(
"
valproate
encephalopathy
")
.

The
first
ultrastructural
changes
in
structural
elements
of
the
blood
-
brain
-
barrier
(
BBB
)
in
the
cerebellar
cortex
were
detectable
after
3
months
of
the
experiment
.

They
became
more
severe
in
the
later
months
of
the
experiment
,
and
were
most
severe
after
12
months
,
located
mainly
in
the
molecular
layer
of
the
cerebellar
cortex
.

Lesions
of
the
capillary
included
necrosis
of
endothelial
cells
.

Organelles
of
these
cells
,
in
particular
the
mitochondria
(
increased
number
and
size
,
distinct
degeneration
of
their
matrix
and
cristae
)
and
Golgi
apparatus
were
altered
.

Reduced
size
of
capillary
lumen
and
occlusion
were
caused
by
swollen
endothelial
cells
which
had
luminal
protrusions
and
swollen
microvilli
.

Pressure
on
the
vessel
wall
was
produced
by
enlarged
perivascular
astrocytic
processes
.

Fragments
of
necrotic
endothelial
cells
were
in
the
vascular
lumens
and
in
these
there
was
loosening
and
breaking
of
tight
cellular
junctions
.

Damage
to
the
vascular
basement
lamina
was
also
observed
.

Damage
to
the
capillary
was
accompanied
by
marked
damage
to
neuroglial
cells
,
mainly
to
perivascular
processes
of
astrocytes
.

The
proliferation
of
astrocytes
(
Bergmann
's
in
particular
)
and
occasionally
of
oligodendrocytes
was
found
.

Alterations
in
the
structural
elements
of
the
BBB
coexisted
with
marked
lesions
of
neurons
of
the
cerebellum
(
Purkinje
cells
are
earliest
)
.

In
electron
micrographs
both
luminal
and
antiluminal
sides
of
the
BBB
of
the
cerebellar
cortex
had
similar
lesions
.

The
possible
influence
of
the
hepatic
damage
,
mainly
hyperammonemia
,
upon
the
development
of
valproate
encephalopathy
is
discussed
.

Macula
toxicity
after
intravitreal
amikacin
.

BACKGROUND
:

Although
intravitreal
aminoglycosides
have
substantially
improved
visual
prognosis
in
endophthalmitis
,
macular
infarction
may
impair
full
visual
recovery
.

METHODS
:

We
present
a
case
of
presumed
amikacin

retinal
toxicity
following
treatment
with
amikacin
and
vancomycin
for
alpha
-
haemolytic
streptococcal
endophthalmitis
.

RESULTS
:

Endophthalmitis
resolved
with
improvement
in
visual
acuity
to
6/24
at
three
months
.

Fundus

fluorescein
angiography
confirmed
macular
capillary
closure
and
telangiectasis
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Currently
accepted
intravitreal
antibiotic
regimens
may
cause
retinal
toxicity
and
macular
ischaemia
.

Treatment
strategies
aimed
at
avoiding
retinal
toxicity
are
discussed
.

Epidemic
of
liver
disease
caused
by
hydrochlorofluorocarbons
used
as
ozone
-sparing
substitutes
of
chlorofluorocarbons
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons

(
HCFCs
)
are
used
increasingly
in
industry
as
substitutes
for
ozone
-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons

(
CFCs
)
.

Limited
studies
in
animals
indicate
potential
hepatotoxicity
of
some
of
these
compounds
.

We
investigated
an
epidemic
of
liver
disease
in
nine
industrial
workers
who
had
had
repeated
accidental
exposure
to
a
mixture
of
1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane

(
HCFC
123
)
and
1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane

(
HCFC
124
)
.

All
nine
exposed
workers
were
affected
to
various
degrees
.

Both
compounds
are
metabolised
in
the
same
way
as
1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane

(
halothane
)
to
form
reactive
trifluoroacetyl

halide
intermediates
,
which
have
been
implicated
in
the
hepatotoxicity
of
halothane
.

We
aimed
to
test
whether
HCFCs
123
and
124
can
result
in
serious
liver
disease
.

METHODS
:

For
one
severely
affected
worker
liver
biopsy
and
immunohistochemical
stainings
for
the
presence
of
trifluoroacetyl
protein
adducts
were
done
.

The
serum
of
six
affected
workers
and
five
controls
was
tested
for
autoantibodies
that
react
with
human
liver
cytochrome
-
P450
2E1
(
P450
2E1
)
and
P58
protein
disulphide
isomerase
isoform
(
P58
)
.

FINDINGS
:

The
liver
biopsy
sample
showed
hepatocellular

necrosis
which
was
prominent
in
perivenular
zone
three
and
extended
focally
from
portal
tracts
to
portal
tracts
and
centrilobular
areas
(
bridging
necrosis
)
.

Trifluoroacetyl
-adducted
proteins
were
detected
in
surviving
hepatocytes
.

Autoantibodies
against
P450
2E1
or
P58
,
previously
associated
with
halothane
hepatitis
,
were
detected
in
the
serum
of
five
affected
workers
.

INTERPRETATION
:

Repeated
exposure
of
human
beings
to
HCFCs
123
and
124
can
result
in
serious
liver
injury
in
a
large
proportion
of
the
exposed
population
.

Although
the
exact
mechanism
of
hepatotoxicity
of
these
agents
is
not
known
,
the
results
suggest
that
trifluoroacetyl
-altered

liver
proteins
are
involved
.

In
view
of
the
potentially
widespread
use
of
these
compounds
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
develop
safer
alternatives
.

The
effect
of
different
anaesthetic
agents
in
hearing
loss
following
spinal
anaesthesia
.

The
cause
of
hearing
loss
after
spinal
anaesthesia
is
unknown
.

Up
until
now
,
the
only
factor
studied
has
been
the
effect
of
the
diameter
of
the
spinal
needle
on
post
-
operative
sensorineural
hearing
loss
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
describe
this
hearing
loss
and
to
investigate
other
factors
influencing
the
degree
of
hearing
loss
.

Two
groups
of
22
similar
patients
were
studied
:
one
group
received
6
mL
prilocaine

2
%
;
and
the
other
received
3
mL

bupivacaine
0.5
%
.

Patients
given
prilocaine
were
more
likely
to
develop
hearing
loss

(
10
out
of
22
)
than
those
given
bupivacaine

(
4
out
of
22
)
(
P
0.05
)
.

The
average
hearing
loss
for
speech
frequencies
was
about
10
dB
after
prilocaine
and
15
dB
after
bupivacaine
.

None
of
the
patients
complained
of
subjective
hearing
loss
.

Long

%
hyperbaric
bupivacaine
slowly
injected
through
a
25-gauge
pencil
-
point
spinal
needle
.

The
surgery
and
anaesthesia
were
uneventful
,
but
3
days
after
surgery
,
the
patient
reported
an
area
of
hypoaesthesia
over
L3-L4
dermatomes
of
the
leg
which
had
been
operated
on
(
loss
of
pinprick
sensation
)
without
reduction
in
muscular
strength
.

Sensation
in
this
area
returned
to
normal
over
the
following
2
weeks
.

Prospective
multicentre
studies
with
a
large
population
and
a
long
follow
-
up
should
be
performed
in
order
to
evaluate
the
incidence
of
this
unusual
side
effect
.

However
,
we
suggest
that
a
low
solution
concentration
should
be
preferred
for
unilateral
spinal
anaesthesia
with
a
hyperbaric
anaesthetic
solution
(
if
pencil
-
point
needle
and
slow
injection
rate
are
employed
)
,
in
order
to
minimize
the
risk
of
a
localized
high
peak
anaesthetic
concentration
,
which
might
lead
to
a
transient
neurological
deficit
.

Pethidine
-associated
seizure
in
a
healthy
adolescent
receiving
pethidine
for
postoperative
pain
control
.

A
healthy
17-year
-
old
male
received
standard
intermittent
doses
of
pethidine
via
a
patient
-
controlled
analgesia
(
PCA
)
pump
for
management
of
postoperative
pain
control
.

Twenty
-
three
h
postoperatively

he
developed
a
brief
self
-
limited
seizure
.

Both
plasma

pethidine
and
norpethidine
were
elevated
in
the
range
associated
with
clinical
manifestations
of
central
nervous
system
excitation
.

No
other
risk
factors
for
CNS
toxicity
were
identified
.

This
method
allowed
frequent
self
-
dosing
of
pethidine
at
short
time
intervals
and
rapid
accumulation
of
pethidine
and
norpethidine
.

The
routine
use
of
pethidine
via
PCA
even
for
a
brief
postoperative
analgesia
should
be
reconsidered
.

Drug

Johnson
syndromes
in

Acute
vanishing
bile

syndrome
is
a
rare
but
established
cause
of
progressive
cholestasis
in
adults
,
is
most
often
drug
or
toxin
related
,
and
is
of
unknown
pathogenesis
.

It
has
not
been
reported
previously
in

.

Stevens

is
a
well

that
affects
all
age
groups
,
is

,
and
has

.

A
previously

who
developed
acute

severe
,
rapidly
progressive
vanishing

syndrome
shortly
after
Stevens

is
described
;
this
was
temporally
associated
with
ibuprofen
use
.

Despite
therapy
with

and
then
tacrolimus
,

her
cholestatic

was
unrelenting
,
with

months
after

.

This
case
documents
acute
drug

in
the
pediatric

and
suggests
shared

High
incidence
of
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
associated
with
appetite
suppressants
in
Belgium
.

Primary
pulmonary
hypertension
is
a
rare
,
progressive
and
incurable
disease
,
which
has
been
associated
with
the
intake
of
appetite
suppressant
drugs
.

The
importance
of
this
association
was
evaluated
in
Belgium
while
this
country
still
had
no
restriction
on
the
prescription
of
appetite
suppressants
.

Thirty
-
five
patients
with
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
and
85
matched
controls
were
recruited
over
32
months
(
1992
-
1994
)
in
Belgium
.

Exposure
to
appetite
-
suppressants
was
assessed
on
the
basis
of
hospital
records
and
standardized
interview
.

Twenty
-
three
of
the
patients
had
previously
taken
appetite
suppressants
,
mainly
fenfluramines
,
as
compared
with
only
5
of
the
controls
(
66
versus
6
%
,
p<0.0001
)
.

Five
patients
died
before
the
interview
,
all
of
them
had
taken
appetite
suppressants
.

In
8
patients
the
diagnosis
of
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
was
uncertain
,
5
of
them
had
taken
appetite
suppressants
.

The
patients
who
had
been
exposed
to
appetite
suppressants
tended
to
be
on
average
more
severely
ill
,
and
to
have
a
shorter
median
delay
between
onset
of
symptoms
and
diagnosis
.

A
policy
of
unrestricted
prescription
of
appetite
suppressants
may
lead
to
a
high
incidence
of
associated
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
.

Intake
of
appetite
suppressants
may
accelerate
the
progression
of
the
disease
.

Choreoathetoid
movements
associated
with
rapid
adjustment
to
methadone
.

Choreatiform
hyperkinesias
are
known
to
be
occasional
movement
abnormalities
during
intoxications
with
cocaine
but
not
opiates
.

This
is
a
case
report
of
euphoria
and
choreoathetoid
movements
both
transiently
induced
by
rapid
adjustment
to
the
selective
mu
-
opioid
receptor
agonist
methadone
in
an
inpatient
previously
abusing
heroine
and
cocaine
.

In
addition
,
minor
EEG
abnormalities
occurred
.

Possible
underlying
neurobiological
phenomena
are
discussed

Cocaine
-induced
mood
disorder
:
prevalence
rates
and
psychiatric
symptoms
in
an
outpatient
cocaine
-dependent
sample
.

This
paper
attempts
to
examine
and
compare
prevalence
rates
and
symptom
patterns
of
DSM
substance
-
induced
and
other
mood
disorders
.

243

cocaine

-dependent
outpatients
with

cocaine
-induced

mood
disorder

(
CIMD
)
,
other
mood
disorders
,
or
no
mood
disorder
were
compared
on
measures
of
psychiatric
symptoms
.

The
prevalence
rate
for
CIMD
was
12
%
at
baseline
.

Introduction
of
the
DSM
-
IV
diagnosis
of
CIMD
did
not
substantially
affect
rates
of
the
other
depressive
disorders
.

Patients
with
CIMD

had
symptom
severity
levels
between
those
of
patients
with
and
without
a
mood
disorder
.

These
findings
suggest
some
validity
for
the
new
DSM
-
IV
diagnosis
of
CIMD
,
but
also
suggest
that
it
requires
further
specification
and
replication
.

Hemolysis
of
human
erythrocytes
induced
by
tamoxifen
is
related
to
disruption
of
membrane
structure
.

Tamoxifen
(
TAM
)
,
the
antiestrogenic
drug
most
widely
prescribed
in
the
chemotherapy
of
breast
cancer
,
induces
changes
in
normal
discoid
shape
of
erythrocytes
and
hemolytic
anemia
.

This
work
evaluates
the
effects
of
TAM
on
isolated
human
erythrocytes
,
attempting
to
identify
the
underlying
mechanisms
on
TAM
-induced
hemolytic
anemia
and
the
involvement
of
biomembranes
in
its
cytostatic
action
mechanisms
.

TAM
induces

hemolysis
of
erythrocytes
as
a
function
of
concentration
.

The
extension
of
hemolysis
is
variable
with
erythrocyte
samples
,
but
12.5
microM
TAM
induces
total
hemolysis
of
all
tested
suspensions
.

Despite
inducing
extensive
erythrocyte
lysis
,
TAM
does
not
shift
the
osmotic
fragility
curves
of
erythrocytes
.

The
hemolytic
effect
of
TAM
is
prevented
by
low
concentrations
of
alpha
-
tocopherol

(
alpha
-
T
)
and
alpha
-
tocopherol
acetate

(
alpha
-
TAc
)
(
inactivated
functional
hydroxyl
)
indicating
that
TAM
-induced
hemolysis
is
not
related
to
oxidative
membrane
damage
.

This
was
further
evidenced
by
absence
of
oxygen
consumption
and
hemoglobin
oxidation
both
determined
in
parallel
with
TAM
-induced
hemolysis
.

Furthermore
,
it
was
observed
that
TAM
inhibits
the
peroxidation
of
human
erythrocytes
induced
by
AAPH
,
thus
ruling
out
TAM
-induced
cell
oxidative
stress
.

Hemolysis
caused
by
TAM
was
not
preceded
by
the
leakage
of
K
(

+
)
from
the
cells
,
also
excluding
a
colloid
-
osmotic
type
mechanism
of
hemolysis
,
according
to
the
effects
on
osmotic
fragility
curves
.

However
,
TAM
induces
release
of
peripheral
proteins
of
membrane
-
cytoskeleton
and
cytosol
proteins
essentially
bound
to
band
3
.

Either
alpha
-
T
or
alpha
-
TAc
increases
membrane
packing
and
prevents
TAM
partition
into
model
membranes
.

These
effects
suggest
that
the
protection
from
hemolysis
by
tocopherols
is
related
to
a
decreased
TAM
incorporation
in
condensed
membranes
and
the
structural
damage
of
the
erythrocyte
membrane
is
consequently
avoided
.

Therefore
,
TAM
-induced
hemolysis
results
from
a
structural
perturbation
of
red
cell
membrane
,
leading
to
changes
in
the
framework
of
the
erythrocyte
membrane
and
its
cytoskeleton
caused
by
its
high
partition
in
the
membrane
.

These
defects
explain
the
abnormal
erythrocyte
shape
and
decreased
mechanical
stability
promoted
by
TAM
,
resulting
in
hemolytic
anemia
.

Additionally
,
since
membrane
leakage
is
a
final
stage
of
cytotoxicity
,
the
disruption
of
the
structural
characteristics
of
biomembranes
by
TAM
may
contribute
to
the
multiple
mechanisms
of
its
anticancer
action
.

Changes
of
sodium
and
ATP
affinities
of
the
cardiac
(
Na
,
K
)

-ATPase
during
and
after
nitric
oxide
deficient
hypertension
.

In
the
cardiovascular
system
,
NO
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
a
variety
of
functions
.

Inhibition
of
NO

synthesis
induces
sustained
hypertension
.

In
several
models
of
hypertension
,
elevation
of
intracellular
sodium
level
was
documented
in
cardiac
tissue
.

To
assess
the
molecular
basis
of
disturbances
in
transmembraneous
transport
of
Na

+
,
we
studied
the
response
of
cardiac
(
Na
,
K
)
-ATPase
to

NO

-deficient

hypertension
induced
in
rats
by

NO
-synthase
inhibition
with
40
mg
/
kg
/
day
N(G)-nitro
-
L
-
arginine
methyl
ester

(
L
-
NAME
)
for
4
four
weeks
.

After
4-week
administration
of
L
-
NAME
,
the
systolic
blood
pressure
(
SBP
)
increased
by
36
%
.

Two
weeks
after
terminating
the
treatment
,
the
SBP
recovered
to
control
value
.

When
activating
the
(
Na
,
K
)
-ATPase
with
its
substrate
ATP
,
no
changes
in
Km
and
Vmax
values
were
observed
in
NO
-deficient
rats
.

During
activation
with
Na

+
,
the
Vmax
remained
unchanged
,
however
the
K
(
Na
)
increased
by
50
%
,
indicating
a
profound
decrease
in
the
affinity
of
the
Na
+
-binding
site
in
NO
-deficient
rats
.

After
recovery
from
hypertension
,
the
activity
of
(
Na
,
K
)
-ATPase
increased
,
due
to
higher
affinity
of
the
ATP
-binding
site
,
as
revealed
from
the
lowered
Km
value
for
ATP
.

The
K
(
Na
)
value
for
Na
+
returned
to
control
value
.

Inhibition
of
NO
-synthase
induced
a
reversible
hypertension
accompanied
by
depressed

Na
+
-extrusion
from
cardiac
cells
as
a
consequence
of
deteriorated
Na
+
-binding
properties
of
the
(
Na
,
K
)

-ATPase
.

After
recovery
of
blood
pressure
to
control
values
,
the
extrusion
of
Na
+
from
cardiac
cells
was
normalized
,
as
revealed
by
restoration
of
the
(
Na
,
K
)
-ATPase
activity
.

Effects
of
long
-
term
pretreatment
with
isoproterenol
on
bromocriptine
-induced
tachycardia
in
conscious
rats
.

It
has
been
shown
that
bromocriptine

-induced

tachycardia
,
which
persisted
after
adrenalectomy
,
is
(
i
)
mediated
by
central
dopamine
D2
receptor
activation
and
(
ii
)
reduced
by
5-day
isoproterenol
pretreatment
,
supporting
therefore
the
hypothesis
that
this
effect
is
dependent
on
sympathetic
outflow
to
the
heart
.

This
study
was
conducted
to
examine
whether
prolonged
pretreatment
with
isoproterenol
could
abolish
bromocriptine
-induced

tachycardia
in
conscious
rats
.

Isoproterenol
pretreatment
for
15
days
caused
cardiac
hypertrophy
without
affecting
baseline
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
.

In
control
rats
,
intravenous
bromocriptine

(
150
microg
/
kg
)
induced
significant
hypotension
and
tachycardia
.

Bromocriptine
-induced

hypotension
was
unaffected
by
isoproterenol
pretreatment
,
while
tachycardia
was
reversed
to
significant
bradycardia
,
an
effect
that
was
partly
reduced
by
i.v
.

domperidone
(
0.5
mg
/
kg
)
.

Neither
cardiac
vagal
nor
sympathetic
tone
was
altered
by
isoproterenol
pretreatment
.

In
isolated
perfused
heart
preparations
from
isoproterenol

-pretreated
rats
,
the
isoproterenol
-induced
maximal
increase
in
left
ventricular
systolic
pressure
was
significantly
reduced
,
compared
with
saline
-
pretreated
rats
(
the
EC50
of
the
isoproterenol
-induced
increase
in
left
ventricular
systolic
pressure
was
enhanced
approximately
22-fold
)
.

These
results
show
that
15-day
isoproterenol
pretreatment
not
only
abolished
but
reversed

bromocriptine
-induced

tachycardia
to
bradycardia
,
an
effect
that
is
mainly
related
to
further
cardiac
beta
-
adrenoceptor
desensitization
rather
than
to
impairment
of
autonomic
regulation
of
the
heart
.

They
suggest
that
,
in
normal
conscious
rats
,
the
central
tachycardia
of
bromocriptine
appears
to
predominate
and
to
mask
the
bradycardia
of
this
agonist
at
peripheral
dopamine
D2
receptors
.

A
developmental
analysis
of
clonidine
's
effects
on
cardiac
rate
and
ultrasound
production
in
infant
rats
.

Under
controlled
conditions
,
infant
rats
emit
ultrasonic
vocalizations
during
extreme
cold
exposure
and
after
administration
of
the
alpha(2
)

adrenoceptor
agonist
,
clonidine
.

Previous
investigations
have
determined
that
,
in
response
to
clonidine
,
ultrasound
production
increases
through
the
2nd
-
week
postpartum
and
decreases
thereafter
.

Given
that
sympathetic
neural
dominance
exhibits
a
similar
developmental
pattern
,
and
given
that
clonidine
induces
sympathetic
withdrawal
and
bradycardia
,
we
hypothesized
that
clonidine
's
developmental
effects
on
cardiac
rate
and
ultrasound
production
would
mirror
each
other
.

Therefore
,
in
the
present
experiment
,
the
effects
of
clonidine
administration
(
0.5
mg
/
kg
)
on
cardiac
rate
and
ultrasound
production
were
examined
in
2-
,

8-
,

15-
,
and
20-day
-
old
rats
.

Age
-
related
changes
in
ultrasound
production
corresponded
with
changes
in
cardiovascular
variables
,
including
baseline
cardiac
rate
and

clonidine
-induced

bradycardia
.

This
experiment
is
discussed
with
regard
to
the
hypothesis
that
ultrasound
production
is
the
acoustic
by
-
product
of
a
physiological
maneuver
that
compensates
for
clonidine
's
detrimental
effects
on
cardiovascular
function
.

Differential
effects
of
systemically
administered
ketamine
and
lidocaine
on
dynamic
and
static
hyperalgesia
induced
by
intradermal
capsaicin
in
humans
.

We
have
examined
the
effect
of
systemic
administration
of
ketamine
and
lidocaine
on
brush
-
evoked
(
dynamic
)

pain
and
punctate
-
evoked
(
static
)
hyperalgesia
induced
by
capsaicin
.

In
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
crossover
study
,
we
studied
12
volunteers
in
three
experiments
.

Capsaicin
100
micrograms
was
injected
intradermally
on
the
volar
forearm
followed
by
an
i.v
.

infusion
of
ketamine

(
bolus
0.1
mg
kg-1
over
10
min
followed
by
infusion
of
7
micrograms
kg-1
min-1
)
,
lidocaine
5
mg
kg-1
or
saline
for
50
min
.

Infusion
started
15
min
after
injection
of
capsaicin
.

The
following
were
measured
:
spontaneous
pain
,
pain
evoked
by
punctate
and
brush
stimuli
(
VAS
)
,
and
areas
of
brush
-
evoked
and
punctate
-
evoked
hyperalgesia
.

Ketamine
reduced
both
the
area
of
brush
-
evoked
and
punctate
-
evoked
hyperalgesia
significantly
and
it
tended
to
reduce
brush
-
evoked
pain
.

Lidocaine
reduced
the
area
of
punctate
-
evoked
hyperalgesia
significantly
.

It
tended
to
reduce
VAS
scores
of
spontaneous
pain
but
had
no
effect
on
evoked
pain
.

The
differential
effects
of
ketamine
and
lidocaine
on
static
and
dynamic
hyperalgesia
suggest
that
the
two
types
of
hyperalgesia
are
mediated
by
separate
mechanisms
and
have
a
distinct
pharmacology
.

Cyclosporine
and

tacrolimus
-associated

thrombotic
microangiopathy
.

The
development
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy

(
TMA
)
associated
with
the
use
of
cyclosporine
has
been
well
documented
.

Treatments
have
included
discontinuation
or
reduction
of
cyclosporine
dose
with
or
without
concurrent
plasma
exchange
,
plasma
infusion
,
anticoagulation
,
and
intravenous
immunoglobulin
G
infusion
.

However
,
for
recipients
of
organ
transplantation
,
removing
the
inciting
agent
is
not
without
the
attendant
risk
of
precipitating
acute
rejection
and
graft
loss
.

The
last
decade
has
seen
the
emergence
of
tacrolimus
as
a
potent
immunosuppressive
agent
with
mechanisms
of
action
virtually
identical
to
those
of
cyclosporine
.

As
a
result
,
switching
to
tacrolimus
has
been
reported
to
be
a
viable
therapeutic
option
in
the
setting
of
cyclosporine

-induced
TMA
.

With
the
more
widespread
application
of
tacrolimus
in
organ
transplantation
,
tacrolimus
-associated
TMA
has
also
been
recognized
.

However
,
literature
regarding
the
incidence
of
the
recurrence
of
TMA
in
patients
exposed
sequentially
to
cyclosporine
and
tacrolimus
is
limited
.

We
report
a
case
of
a
living
donor
renal
transplant
recipient
who
developed
cyclosporine
-induced

TMA
that
responded
to
the
withdrawal
of
cyclosporine
in
conjunction
with
plasmapheresis
and
fresh
frozen
plasma
replacement
therapy
.

Introduction
of
tacrolimus
as
an
alternative
immunosuppressive
agent
resulted
in
the
recurrence
of
TMA
and
the
subsequent
loss
of
the
renal
allograft
.

Patients
who
are
switched
from
cyclosporine
to
tacrolimus
or
vice
versa
should
be
closely
monitored
for
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
recurrent
TMA
.

Repeated
transient
anuria
following
losartan
administration
in
a
patient
with
a
solitary
kidney
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
70-year
-
old
hypertensive
man
with
a
solitary
kidney
and
chronic
renal
insufficiency
who
developed
two
episodes
of
transient
anuria
after
losartan
administration
.

He
was
hospitalized
for
a
myocardial
infarction
with
pulmonary
edema
,
treated
with
high
-
dose
diuretics
.

Due
to
severe
systolic
dysfunction
losartan
was
prescribed
.

Surprisingly
,
the
first
dose
of
50
mg
of
losartan
resulted
in
a
sudden
anuria
,
which
lasted
eight
hours
despite
high
-
dose
furosemide
and
amine
infusion
.

One
week
later
,
by
mistake
,
losartan
was
prescribed
again
and
after
the
second
dose
of
50
mg
,
the
patient
developed
a
second
episode
of
transient
anuria
lasting
10
hours
.

During
these
two
episodes
,
his
blood
pressure
diminished
but
no
severe
hypotension
was
noted
.

Ultimately
,
an
arteriography
showed
a
70
-
80
%
renal
artery
stenosis
.

In
this
patient
,
renal
artery
stenosis
combined
with
heart
failure
and
diuretic
therapy
certainly
resulted
in
a
strong
activation
of
the
renin-
angiotensin
system
(
RAS
)
.

Under
such
conditions
,
angiotensin
II
receptor
blockade
by
losartan
probably
induced
a
critical
fall
in
glomerular
filtration
pressure
.

This
case
report
highlights
the
fact
that
the
angiotensin
II
receptor
antagonist
losartan
can
cause
serious
unexpected
complications
in
patients
with
renovascular
disease
and
should
be
used
with
extreme
caution
in
this
setting
.

and
doxorubicin

-induced

cardiotoxicity
by
a
novel
IH636
grape
seed
proanthocyanidin
extract
.

Grape
seed
extract
,
primarily
a
mixture
of
proanthocyanidins
,
has
been
shown
to
modulate
a
wide
-
range
of
biological
,
pharmacological
and
toxicological
effects
which
are
mainly
cytoprotective
.

This
study
assessed
the
ability
of
IH636
grape
seed
proanthocyanidin
extract

(
GSPE
)
to
prevent
acetaminophen

(
AAP
)
-induced
nephrotoxicity
,

amiodarone

(
AMI
)
-induced
lung
toxicity
,
and
doxorubicin
(
DOX
)
-induced

cardiotoxicity
in
mice
.

Experimental
design
consisted
of
four
groups
:
control
(
vehicle
alone
)
,
GSPE
alone
,
drug
alone
and
GSPE
+
drug
.

For
the
cytoprotection
study
,
animals
were
orally
gavaged
100
mg
/
Kg
GSPE
for
7
-
10
days
followed
by
i.p
.

injections
of
organ
specific
three
drugs
(
AAP
:
500
mg
/
Kg
for
24
h
;

AMI
:
50
mg
/
Kg
/
day
for
four
days
;
DOX
:
20
mg
/
Kg
for
48
h
)
.

Parameters
of
study
included
analysis
of
serum
chemistry
(
ALT
,
BUN
and
CPK
)
,
and
orderly
fragmentation
of
genomic
DNA
(
both
endonuclease
-
dependent
and
independent
)
in
addition
to
microscopic
evaluation
of
damage
and/or
protection
in
corresponding
PAS
stained
tissues
.

Results
indicate
that
GSPE
preexposure
prior
to
AAP
,

AMI
and
DOX
,
provided
near
complete
protection
in
terms
of
serum
chemistry
changes
(
ALT
,
BUN
and
CPK
)
,
and
significantly
reduced
DNA
fragmentation
.

Histopathological
examination
of
kidney
,
heart
and
lung
sections
revealed
moderate
to
massive
tissue
damage
with
a
variety
of
morphological
aberrations
by
all
the
three
drugs
in
the
absence
of
GSPE
preexposure
than
in
its
presence
.

GSPE
+
drug
exposed
tissues
exhibited
minor
residual
damage
or
near
total
recovery
.

Additionally
,
histopathological
alterations
mirrored
both
serum
chemistry
changes
and
the
pattern
of
DNA
fragmentation
.

Interestingly
,
all
the
drugs
,
such
as
,
AAP
,
AMI
and
DOX
induced
apoptotic
death
in
addition
to
necrosis
in
the
respective
organs
which
was
very
effectively
blocked
by
GSPE
.

Since
AAP
,
AMI
and
DOX
undergo
biotransformation
and
are
known
to
produce
damaging
radicals
in
vivo
,
the
protection
by
GSPE
may
be
linked
to
both
inhibition
of
metabolism
and/or
detoxification
of
cytotoxic
radicals
.

In
addition
,
its
'
presumed
contribution
to
DNA
repair
may
be
another
important
attribute
,
which
played
a
role
in
the
chemoprevention
process
.

Additionally
,
this
may
have
been
the
first
report
on
AMI

-induced
apoptotic
death
in
the
lung
tissue
.

Taken
together
,
these
events
undoubtedly
establish
GSPE
's
abundant
bioavailability
,
and
the
power
to
defend
multiple
target
organs
from
toxic
assaults
induced
by
structurally
diverse
and
functionally
different
entities
in
vivo
.

Palpebral
twitching
in
a
depressed
adolescent
on
citalopram
.

Current
estimates
suggest
that
between
0.4
%
and
8.3
%
of
children
and
adolescents
are
affected
by
major
depression
.

We
report
a
favorable
response
to
treatment
with
citalopram
by
a
15-year
-
old
boy
with
major
depression
who
exhibited
palpebral
twitching
during
his
first
2
weeks
of
treatment
.

This
may
have
been
a
side
effect
of
citalopram
as
it
remitted
with
redistribution
of
doses
.

Metamizol
potentiates
morphine

antinociception
but
not
constipation
after
chronic
treatment
.

This
work
evaluates
the
antinociceptive
and
constipating
effects
of
the
combination
of
3.2
mg
/
kg
s.c
.

morphine
with
177.8
mg
/
kg
s.c
.

metamizol
in
acutely
and
chronically
treated
(
once
a
day
for
12
days
)
rats
.

On
the
13th
day
,
antinociceptive
effects
were
assessed
using
a
model
of
inflammatory
nociception
,
pain
-induced
functional
impairment
model
,
and
the
charcoal
meal
test
was
used
to
evaluate
the
intestinal
transit
.

Simultaneous
administration
of
morphine
with
metamizol
resulted
in
a
markedly
antinociceptive
potentiation
and
an
increasing
of
the
duration
of
action
after
a
single
(
298+/-7
vs.
139+/-36
units
area
(
ua
)
;
P<0.001
)
and
repeated
administration
(
280+/-17
vs.
131+/-22
ua
;
P<0.001
)
.

Antinociceptive
effect
of
morphine
was
reduced
in
chronically
treated
rats
(
39+/-10
vs.
18+/-5
au
)
while
the
combination
-
induced
antinociception
was
remained
similar
as
an
acute
treatment
(
298+/-7
vs.
280+/-17
au
)
.

Acute
antinociceptive
effects
of
the
combination
were
partially
prevented
by
3.2
mg
/
kg
naloxone
s.c
.

(
P<0.05
)
,
suggesting
the
partial
involvement
of
the
opioidergic
system
in
the
synergism
observed
.

In
independent
groups
,
morphine
inhibited
the
intestinal
transit
in
48+/-4
%
and
38+/-4
%
after
acute
and
chronic
treatment
,
respectively
,
suggesting
that
tolerance
did
not
develop
to
the
constipating
effects
.

The
combination
inhibited
intestinal
transit
similar
to
that
produced
by
morphine
regardless
of
the
time
of
treatment
,
suggesting
that
metamizol
did
not
potentiate

morphine
-induced

constipation
.

These
findings
show
a
significant
interaction
between
morphine
and
metamizol
in
chronically
treated
rats
,
suggesting
that
this
combination
could
be
useful
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
pain
.

Ifosfamide
encephalopathy
presenting
with
asterixis
.

CNS
toxic
effects
of
the
antineoplastic
agent
ifosfamide

(
IFX
)
are
frequent
and
include
a
variety
of
neurological
symptoms
that
can
limit
drug
use
.

We
report
a
case
of
a
51-year
-
old
man
who
developed
severe
,
disabling
negative
myoclonus
of
the
upper
and
lower
extremities
after
the
infusion
of
ifosfamide
for
plasmacytoma
.

He
was
awake
,
revealed
no
changes
of
mental
status
and
at
rest
there
were
no
further
motor
symptoms
.

Cranial
magnetic
resonance
imaging
and
extensive
laboratory
studies
failed
to
reveal
structural
lesions
of
the
brain
and
metabolic
abnormalities
.

An
electroencephalogram
showed
continuous
,
generalized
irregular
slowing
with
admixed
periodic
triphasic
waves
indicating
symptomatic
encephalopathy
.

The
administration
of
ifosfamide
was
discontinued
and
within
12
h
the
asterixis
resolved
completely
.

In
the
patient
described
,
the
presence
of
asterixis
during
infusion
of
ifosfamide
,
normal
laboratory
findings
and
imaging
studies
and
the
resolution
of
symptoms
following
the
discontinuation
of
the
drug
suggest
that
negative
myoclonus
is
associated
with
the
use
of
IFX
.

.

RATIONALE
:

gamma
-
Vinyl
GABA

(
GVG
)
irreversibly
inhibits

GABA

.

This
non

mediated
inhibition
requires
de

.

OBJECTIVES
:

Given
its
preclinical
success
for
treating
substance
abuse
and
the
increased
risk
of
visual
field
defects

(
VFD
)
associated
with
cumulative
lifetime
exposure
,
we
explored
the
effects
of
sub
-
chronic
low
dose
GVG
on

cocaine
-induced
increases
in
nucleus
accumbens
(
NAcc
)
dopamine

(
DA
)
.

METHODS
:
Using
in
vivo
microdialysis
,
we
compared
acute
exposure
(
450
mg
/
kg
)
to
an
identical
sub
-
chronic
exposure
(
150
mg
/
kg
per
day
for
3
days
)
,
followed
by
1-
or
3-day
washout
.

Finally
,
we
examined
the
low
dose
of
150
mg
/
kg
(
50
mg
/
kg
per
day
)
using
a
similar
washout
period
.

RESULTS
:

Sub
-
chronic
GVG
exposure
inhibited
the
effect
of
cocaine
for
3
days
,
which
exceeded
in
magnitude
and
duration
the
identical
acute
dose
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Sub
-
chronic
low
dose

GVG
potentiates
and
extends
the
inhibition
of

cocaine
-induced
increases
in
dopamine
,
effectively
reducing
cumulative
exposures
and
the
risk
for
VFDS
.

Amount
of
bleeding
and
hematoma
size
in
the
collagenase
-
induced
intracerebral
hemorrhage
rat
model
.

The
aggravated
risk
on
intracerebral
hemorrhage

(
ICH
)
with
drugs
used
for
stroke
patients
should
be
estimated
carefully
.

We
therefore
established
sensitive
quantification
methods
and
provided
a
rat
ICH
model
for
detection
of
ICH
deterioration
.

In
ICH

intrastriatally
induced
by
0.014-unit
,
0.070-unit
,
and
0.350-unit
collagenase
,
the
amount
of
bleeding
was
measured
using
a
hemoglobin
assay
developed
in
the
present
study
and
was
compared
with
the
morphologically
determined
hematoma
volume
.

The
blood
amounts
and
hematoma
volumes
were
significantly
correlated
,
and
the
hematoma

induced
by
0.014-unit
collagenase
was
adequate
to
detect
ICH
deterioration
.

In
ICH
induction
using
0.014-unit
collagenase
,
heparin
enhanced
the
hematoma
volume
3.4-fold
over
that
seen
in
control
ICH
animals
and
the
bleeding
7.6-fold
.

Data
suggest
that
this
sensitive
hemoglobin
assay
is
useful
for
ICH
detection
,
and
that
a
model
with
a
small
ICH
induced
with
a
low
-
dose
collagenase
should
be
used
for
evaluation
of
drugs
that
may
affect
ICH
.

Estradiol
reduces

seizure
-induced

hippocampal
injury
in
ovariectomized
female
but
not
in
male
rats
.

Estrogens
protect
ovariectomized
rats
from
hippocampal
injury
induced
by

kainic
acid
-induced

status
epilepticus

(
SE
)
.

We
compared
the
effects
of
17beta
-
estradiol
in
adult
male
and
ovariectomized
female
rats
subjected
to
lithium
-
pilocarpine
-induced
SE
.

Rats
received
subcutaneous
injections
of
17beta
-
estradiol

(
2
microg
/
rat
)
or
oil
once
daily
for
four
consecutive
days
.

SE
was
induced
20
h
following
the
second
injection
and
terminated
3
h
later
.

The
extent
of
silver
-stained
CA3
and
CA1
hippocampal
neurons
was
evaluated
2
days
after
SE
.

17beta
-
Estradiol
did
not
alter
the
onset
of
first
clonus
in
ovariectomized
rats
but
accelerated
it
in
males
.

17beta
-
Estradiol
reduced
the
argyrophilic
neurons
in
the
CA1
and
CA3-C
sectors
of
ovariectomized
rats
.

In
males
,
estradiol
increased
the
total
damage
score
.

These
findings
suggest
that
the
effects
of
estradiol
on
seizure
threshold
and
damage
may
be
altered
by
sex
-
related
differences
in
the
hormonal
environment
.

Delirium
during
clozapine
treatment
:
incidence
and
associated
risk
factors
.

BACKGROUND
:

Incidence
and
risk
factors
for
delirium
during
clozapine
treatment
require
further
clarification
.

METHODS
:

We
used
computerized
pharmacy
records
to
identify
all
adult
psychiatric
inpatients
treated
with
clozapine

(
1995
-
96
)
,
reviewed
their
medical
records
to
score
incidence
and
severity
of
delirium
,
and
tested
associations
with
potential
risk
factors
.

RESULTS
:

Subjects
(
n
=
139
)
were
72
women
and
67
men
,
aged
40.8
+
/-
12.1
years
,
hospitalized
for
24.9
+
/-

23.3
days
,
and
given
clozapine
,
gradually
increased
to
an
average
daily
dose
of
282
+
/-

203
mg
(
3.45
+
/-

2.45
mg
/
kg
)
for
18.9
+
/-

16.4
days
.

Delirium
was
diagnosed
in
14
(
10.1
%
incidence
,
or
1.48
cases
/
person
-
years
of
exposure
)
;
71.4
%
of
cases
were
moderate
or
severe
.

Associated
factors
were
co
-
treatment
with
other
centrally
antimuscarinic
agents
,
poor
clinical
outcome
,
older
age
,
and
longer
hospitalization
(
by
17.5
days
,
increasing
cost
)
;
sex
,
diagnosis
or
medical
co
-
morbidity
,
and
daily
clozapine
dose
,
which
fell
with
age
,
were
unrelated
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Delirium
was
found
in
10
%
of
clozapine
-treated
inpatients
,
particularly
in
older
patients
exposed
to
other
central
anticholinergics
.

Delirium
was
inconsistently
recognized
clinically
in
milder
cases
and
was
associated
with
increased
length
-
of
-
stay
and
higher
costs
,
and
inferior
clinical
outcome
.

Ketoconazole
-induced
neurologic
sequelae
.

A
77-y
-
old
patient
developed
weakness
of
extremities
,
legs
paralysis
,
dysarthria
and
tremor

1
h
after
ingestion
of
200
mg
ketoconazole
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.

All
complaints
faded
away
within
24
h.
Few
days
later
,
the
patient
used
another
200
mg
ketoconazole
tablet
,
and
within
an
hour
experienced
a
similar
clinical
picture
,
which
resolved
again
spontaneously
within
hours
.

Laboratory
evaluations
,
including
head
CT
scan
,
were
normal
.

This
case
illustrates
the
need
for
close
vigilance
in
adverse
drug
reactions
,
particularly
in
the
elderly
.

Noxious
chemical
stimulation
of
rat
facial
mucosa
increases
intracranial
blood
flow
through
a
trigemino
-
parasympathetic
reflex
--
an
experimental
model
for
vascular
dysfunctions
in
cluster
headache
.

Cluster
headache
is
characterized
by
typical
autonomic
dysfunctions
including
facial
and
intracranial
vascular
disturbances
.

Both
the
trigeminal
and
the
cranial
parasympathetic
systems
may
be
involved
in
mediating
these
dysfunctions
.

An
experimental
model
was
developed
in
the
rat
to
measure
changes
in
lacrimation
and
intracranial
blood
flow
following
noxious
chemical
stimulation
of
facial
mucosa
.

Blood
flow
was
monitored
in
arteries
of
the
exposed
cranial
dura
mater
and
the
parietal
cortex
using
laser
Doppler
flowmetry
.

Capsaicin
(
0.01
-
1
mm
)
applied
to
oral
or
nasal
mucosa
induced
increases
in
dural
and
cortical
blood
flow
and
provoked
lacrimation
.

These
responses
were
blocked
by
systemic
pre
-
administration
of
hexamethonium
chloride
(
20
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
evoked
increases
in
dural
blood
flow
were
also
abolished
by
topical
pre
-
administration
of
atropine
(
1
mm
)
and
[
Lys1
,
Pro2,5
,
Arg3,4
,
Tyr6]-VIP
(
0.1
mm
)
,
a
vasoactive
intestinal
polypeptide
(
VIP
)
antagonist
,
onto
the
exposed
dura
mater
.

We
conclude
that
noxious
stimulation
of
facial
mucosa
increases
intracranial
blood
flow
and
lacrimation
via
a
trigemino
-
parasympathetic
reflex
.

The
blood
flow
responses
seem
to
be
mediated
by
the
release
of
acetylcholine
and
VIP
within
the
meninges
.

Similar
mechanisms
may
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
cluster
headache
.

Recurrent
excitation
in
the
dentate
gyrus
of
a
murine
model
of
temporal

epilepsy
.

Similar
to
rats
,
systemic
pilocarpine

injection
causes
status
epilepticus

(
SE
)
and
the
eventual
development
of
spontaneous
seizures
and
mossy
fiber
sprouting
in
C57BL/6
and
CD1
mice
,
but
the
physiological
correlates
of
these
events
have
not
been
identified
in
mice
.

Population
responses
in
granule
cells
of
the
dentate
gyrus
were
examined
in
transverse
slices
of
the
ventral
hippocampus
from
pilocarpine

-treated
and
untreated
mice
.

In
Mg
(
2+)-free
bathing
medium
containing
bicuculline
,
conditions
designed
to
increase
excitability
in
the
slices
,
electrical
stimulation
of
the
hilus
resulted
in
a
single
population
spike
in
granule
cells
from
control
mice
and
pilocarpine
-treated
mice
that
did
not
experience
SE
.

In
SE
survivors
,
similar
stimulation
resulted
in
a
population
spike
followed
,
at
a
variable
latency
,
by
negative
DC
shifts
and
repetitive
afterdischarges
of
3
-
60
s
duration
,
which
were
blocked
by
ionotropic
glutamate
receptor
antagonists
.

Focal
glutamate
photostimulation
of
the
granule
cell
layer
at
sites
distant
from
the
recording
pipette
resulted
in
population
responses
of
1
-
30
s
duration
in
slices
from
SE
survivors
but
not
other
groups
.

These
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
SE
-induced
mossy
fiber
sprouting
and
synaptic
reorganization
are
relevant
characteristics
of
seizure
development
in
these
murine
strains
,
resembling
rat
models
of
human
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
.

The
alpha3
and
beta4
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptor
subunits
are
necessary
for

nicotine
-induced
seizures
and
hypolocomotion
in
mice
.

Binding
of
nicotine
to
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
elicits
a
series
of
dose
-
dependent
behaviors
that
go
from
altered
exploration
,
sedation
,
and
tremors
,
to
seizures
and
death
.

nAChRs
are
pentameric
ion
channels
usually
composed
of
alpha
and
beta
subunits
.

A
gene
cluster
comprises
the
alpha3
,
alpha5
and
beta4
subunits
,
which
coassemble
to
form
functional
receptors
.

We
examined
the
role
of
the
beta4
subunits
in
nicotine
-induced

seizures
and
hypolocomotion
in
beta4
homozygous
null
(
beta4
-/-
)
and
alpha3
heterozygous
(
+
/-
)

mice
.

beta4
-/-
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
the
effects
of
nicotine
both
at
low
doses
,
measured
as
decreased
exploration
in
an
open
field
,
and
at
high
doses
,
measured
as
sensitivity
to
nicotine
-induced
seizures
.

Using
in
situ
hybridization
probes
for
the
alpha3
and
alpha5
subunits
,
we
showed
that
alpha5
mRNA
levels
are
unchanged
,
whereas
alpha3
mRNA
levels
are
selectively
decreased
in
the
mitral
cell
layer
of
the
olfactory
bulb
,
and
the
inferior
and
the
superior
colliculus
of
beta4
-/-
brains
.

alpha3
+
/-

mice
were
partially
resistant
to
nicotine
-induced

seizures
when
compared
to
wild
-
type
littermates
.

mRNA
levels
for
the
alpha5
and
the
beta4
subunits
were
unchanged
in
alpha3
+
/-
brains
.

Together
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
beta4
and
the
alpha3
subunits
are
mediators
of
nicotine
-induced
seizures
and
hypolocomotion
.

Recurrent

azithromycin
.

A
14-year
-
old
girl
is
reported
with
recurrent
,
azithromycin
-induced
,
acute
interstitial

.

The
second
episode
was
more
severe
than
the
first
;
and
although
both
were
treated
with
intensive
corticosteroid
therapy
,
renal
function
remained
impaired
.

Although
most
cases
of
antibiotic
induced
acute
interstitial

are
benign
and
self

limited
,
some
patients
are
at
risk
for
permanent

Valproate
-induced
encephalopathy
.

Valproate
-induced

encephalopathy
is
a
rare
syndrome
that
may
manifest
in
otherwise
normal
epileptic
individuals
.

It
may
even
present
in
patients
who
have
tolerated
this
medicine
well
in
the
past
.

It
is
usually
but
not
necessarily
associated
with
hyperammonemia
.

The
EEG
shows
characteristic
triphasic
waves
in
most
patients
with
this
complication
.

A
case
of
valproate
-induced
encephalopathy
is
presented
.

The
problems
in

Nitro

:
a
potential

.

The
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
inhibitor
nitro
-
L
-
arginine
methyl
ester

(
L
-
NAME
)
may
act
as
an
otoprotectant
against
high
-
frequency
hearing
loss
caused
by
gentamicin
,
but
further
studies
are
needed
to
confirm
this
.

Aminoglycoside
antibiotics
are
still
widely
used
by
virtue
of
their
efficacy
and
low
cost
.

Their
ototoxicity
is
a
serious
health
problem
and
,
as
their
ototoxic
mechanism
involves
the
production
of
NO
,
we
need
to
assess
the
use
of
NO
inhibitors
for
the
prevention
of

aminoglycoside
-induced

sensorineural
hearing
loss
.

In
this
experimental
study
we
used
30
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
,
27
of
which
had
gentamicin
instilled
into
the
middle
ear
.

The
otoprotectant
L

was
administered
topically
to
12/27
animals
.

Its
effect
was
determined
in
terms
of
attenuation
of
hearing
loss
,
measured
by
shifts
in
the
auditory
brainstem
response
threshold
.

L
-

reduced

gentamicin

Cerebral
vasculitis
following
oral
methylphenidate
intake
in
an
adult
:
a
case
report
.

Methylphenidate
is
structurally
and
functionally
similar
to
amphetamine
.

Cerebral
vasculitis
associated
with
amphetamine
abuse
is
well
documented
,
and
in
rare
cases
ischaemic
stroke
has
been
reported
after
methylphenidate
intake
in
children
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
63-year
-
old
female
who
was
treated
with
methylphenidate
due
to
hyperactivity
and
suffered
from
multiple
ischaemic
strokes
.

We
consider
drug
-
induced
cerebral
vasculitis
as
the
most
likely
cause
of
recurrent
ischaemic
strokes
in
the
absence
of
any
pathological
findings
during
the
diagnostic
work
-
up
.

We
conclude
that
methylphenidate
mediated

vasculitis
should
be
considered
in
patients
with
neurological
symptoms
and
a
history
of
methylphenidate
therapy
.

This
potential
side
-
effect
,
though
very
rare
,
represents
one
more
reason
to
be
very
restrictive
in
the
use
of
methylphenidate
.

Cerebral
haemorrhage
induced
by
warfarin
-
the
influence
of
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

PURPOSE
:
To
evaluate
the
frequency
,
severity
and
preventability
of

warfarin
-induced

cerebral
haemorrhages
due
to
warfarin
and
warfarin
-drug
interactions
in
patients
living
in
the
county
of
Osterg
tland
,
Sweden
.

METHODS
:

All
patients
with
a
diagnosed
cerebral
haemorrhage
at
three
hospitals
during
the
period
2000
-
2002
were
identified
.

Medical
records
were
studied
retrospectively
to
evaluate
whether
warfarin
and
warfarin

-drug
interactions
could
have
caused
the
cerebral
haemorrhage
.

The
proportion
of
possibly
avoidable
cases
due
to
drug
interactions
was
estimated
.

RESULTS
:

Among
593
patients
with
cerebral
haemorrhage
,
59
(
10
%
)
were
assessed
as
related
to
warfarin
treatment
.

This
imply
an
incidence
of
1.7/100,000
treatment
years
.

Of
the
59
cases
,
26
(
44
%
)
had
a
fatal
outcome
,
compared
to
136
(
25
%
)
among
the
non-
warfarin
patients
(
p
0.01
)
.

A
warfarin
-drug
interaction
could
have
contributed
to
the
haemorrhage
in
24
(
41
%
)
of
the
warfarin
patients
and
in
7
of
these
(
12
%
)
the
bleeding
complication
was
considered
being
possible
to
avoid
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Warfarin
-induced

cerebral
haemorrhages
are
a
major
clinical
problem
with
a
high
fatality
rate
.

Almost
half
of
the
cases
was
related
to
a
warfarin
-drug
interaction
.

A
significant
proportion
of
warfarin
-related

cerebral
haemorrhages
might
have
been
prevented
if
greater
caution
had
been
taken
when
prescribing
drugs
known
to
interact
with
warfarin
.

.

METHODS
:

A
double

double
-
armed
prospective
study
comprised
40
patients
who
had
uneventful
sutureless
phacoemulsification
under
sub
-
Tenon
's
local
infiltration
of
3
mL
of
plain
lignocaine
.

At
the
end
of
the
procedure
,
Group
A
(
n
=
20
)
had
20
mg/0.5
mL
of
methylprednisolone
and
10
mg/0.5
mL
of

gentamicin
injected
into
the
posterior
sub
-
Tenon
's
space
and
Group
B
(
n
=
20
)
had
the
same
combination
injected
into
the
anterior
sub
-
Tenon
's
space
.

Postoperatively
,
all
patients
were
assessed
for
symptoms
of
nausea
,
vomiting
,
and
headache
.

A
chi
-
square
test
was
used
to
assess
the
statistical
significance
of
results
.

RESULTS
:

Sixty
percent
in
Group
A
developed

postoperative
emetic
symptoms
,
headache
,
or
both
;
1
patient
in
Group
B
developed
symptoms
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
administration
of
methylprednisolone
and
gentamicin
in
the
posterior
sub
-
Tenon
's
space
was
related
to
a
high
incidence
of
side
effects
including
nausea
,
vomiting
,
and
headache
.

All
adverse

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:

The
present

is
a
multicenter

were
assessed
at

occurred
in
4.4

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
rate
of
contrast
-
induced
nephropathy
,
defined
by
multiple
end
points
,
is
not
statistically
different
after
the
intraarterial
administration
of
iopamidol
or
iodixanol
to
high
-
risk
patients
,
with
or
without
diabetes
mellitus
.

Any
true
difference
between
the
agents
is
small
and
not
likely
to
be
clinically
significant
.

A
novel
compound
,
maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
,
attenuates
cognitive
deficits
and
shows
neuroprotective
effects
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
dementia
models
.

To
develop
a
novel
and
effective
drug
that
could
enhance
cognitive
function
and
neuroprotection
,
we
newly
synthesized

maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
by
the
esterification
of
maltol
and
p
-
coumaric
acid
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
whether
maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
could
improve
cognitive
decline
in
scopolamine
-injected
rats
and
in
amyloid
beta
peptide(1
-
42
)
-infused
rats
.

Maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
was
found
to
attenuate
cognitive
deficits
in
both
rat
models
using
passive
avoidance
test
and
to
reduce
apoptotic
cell
death
observed
in
the
hippocampus
of
the
amyloid
beta
peptide(1
-
42
)
-infused
rats
.

We
also
examined
the
neuroprotective
effects
of
maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
in
vitro
using
SH
-
SY5Y
cells
.

Cells
were
pretreated
with
maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
,
before
exposed
to
amyloid
beta
peptide(1
-
42
)
,
glutamate
or
H2O2
.

We
found
that
maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
significantly
decreased
apoptotic
cell
death
and
reduced
reactive
oxygen
species
,
cytochrome
c
release
,
and
caspase
3
activation
.

Taking
these
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
results
together
,
our
study
suggests
that
maltolyl
p
-
coumarate
is
a
potentially
effective
candidate
against
Alzheimer
's
disease
that
is
characterized
by
wide
spread

neuronal
death
and
progressive
decline
of
cognitive
function
.

Interaction
between
warfarin
and
levofloxacin
:
case
series
.

Warfarin
is
the
most
widely
used
oral
anticoagulant
and
is
indicated
for
many
clinical
conditions
.

Levofloxacin
,
a
fluoroquinolone
,
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
prescribed
antibiotics
in
clinical
practice
and
is
effective
against
Gram
-
positive
,
Gram
-
negative
,
and
atypical
bacteria
.

While
small
prospective
studies
have
not
revealed
any
significant
drug
-
drug
interaction
between
warfarin
and
levofloxacin
,
several
case
reports
have
indicated
that
levofloxacin
may
significantly
potentiate
the
anticoagulation
effect
of
warfarin
.

We
report
3
cases
of
serious
bleeding
complications
that
appear
to
be
the
result
of
the
interaction
between
warfarin
and
levofloxacin
.

Physicians
should
be
aware
of
this
potential
interaction
and
use
caution
when
prescribing
levofloxacin
to
patients
taking
warfarin
.

HBV
carriers
with

Thirty

HBV
infected
patients
with

infection
were
studied
:
15
chronic

patients
and
20
HBV
-
HIV
co

patients
.

The
latter
group
was
further
sub

divided
into
13
occult
HBV
(
HBsAg
-negative
)
and
7
overt

)
patients
.

HBsAg
,

were
determined
as
part
of
routine

using
Axsym
assays
(
Abbott

.

Serum
samples
were

,
followed
by
direct

across
the

of
the
major

.

HBV

lamivudine

-resistant

were
detected
in
3
of
15
mono
-
infected
chronic

hepatitis
B
patients
and
10
of
20
HBV
-
HIV
co
-
infected
patients
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
constitutes
the
first
report
of
HBV
lamivudine
-resistant

strains
in
therapy-
na

ve
HBV
-
HIV
co
-
infected
patients
.

The
HBV
viral
loads
for
mono

infected
and
co
-
infected
patients
ranged
from
3.32
x
10(2
)
to
3.82
x
10(7
)
and

200
to
4.40
x
10(3
)
copies
/
ml
,
respectively
.

It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
such
pre
-
existing
antiviral
mutations
could
result
in
widespread
emergence
of
HBV
resistant
strains
when
lamivudine
-containing
highly
active
antiretroviral
(
ARV
)
treatment

(
HAART
)
regimens
become
widely
applied
in
South
Africa
,
as
this
is
likely
to
have
potential
implications
in
the
management
of

Sex
differences
in
NMDA
antagonist
enhancement
of

morphine
antihyperalgesia
in
a
capsaicin
model
of
persistent
pain
:
comparisons
to
two
models
of
acute
pain
.

In
acute
pain
models
,
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
antagonists
enhance
the
antinociceptive
effects
of
morphine
to
a
greater
extent
in
males
than
females
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
extend
these
findings
to
a
persistent
pain
model
which
could
be
distinguished
from
acute
pain
models
on
the
basis
of
the
nociceptive
fibers
activated
,
neurochemical
substrates
,
and
duration
of
the
nociceptive
stimulus
.

To
this
end
,
persistent
hyperalgesia
was
induced
by
administration
of
capsaicin
in
the
tail
of
gonadally
intact
F344
rats
,
following
which
the
tail
was
immersed
in
a
mildly
noxious
thermal
stimulus
,
and
tail
-
withdrawal
latencies
measured
.

For
comparison
,
tests
were
conducted
in
two
acute
pain
models
,
the
hotplate
and
warm
water
tail
-
withdrawal
procedures
.

In
males
,
the
non
-
competitive
NMDA
antagonist
dextromethorphan
enhanced
the
antihyperalgesic
effect
of
low
to
moderate
doses
of
morphine
in
a
dose
-
and
time
-
dependent
manner
.

Across
the
doses
and
pretreatment
times
examined
,
enhancement
was
not
observed
in
females
.

Enhancement
of
morphine
antinociception
by
dextromethorphan
was
seen
in
both
males
and
females
in
the
acute
pain
models
,
with
the
magnitude
of
this
effect
being
greater
in
males
.

These
findings
demonstrate
a
sexually
-
dimorphic
interaction
between
NMDA
antagonists
and
morphine
in
a
persistent
pain
model
that
can
be
distinguished
from
those
observed
in
acute
pain
models
.

Development
of
proteinuria
after
switch
to
sirolimus
-based
immunosuppression
in
long
-
term
cardiac
transplant
patients
.

Calcineurin
-
inhibitor
therapy
can
lead
to
renal
dysfunction
in
heart
transplantation
patients
.

The
novel
immunosuppressive
(
IS
)
drug
sirolmus

(
Srl
)
lacks
nephrotoxic
effects
;
however
,
proteinuria
associated
with
Srl
has
been
reported
following
renal
transplantation
.

In
cardiac
transplantation
,
the
incidence
of
proteinuria
associated
with
Srl
is
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
long
-
term
cardiac
transplant
patients
were
switched
from
cyclosporine
to
Srl
-based
IS
.

Concomitant
IS
consisted
of
mycophenolate
mofetil
+
/-

steroids
.

Proteinuria
increased
significantly
from
a
median
of
0.13
g
/
day
(
range
0
-
5.7
)
preswitch
to
0.23
g
/
day
(
0
-
9.88
)
at
24
months
postswitch
(
p
=
0.0024
)
.

Before
the
switch
,
11.5
%
of
patients
had
high
-
grade
proteinuria
(
>
1.0
g
/
day
)
;
this
increased
to
22.9
%
postswitch
(
p
=
0.006
)
.

ACE
inhibitor
and
angiotensin
-
releasing
blocker

(
ARB
)
therapy
reduced
proteinuria
development
.

Patients
without
proteinuria
had
increased
renal
function
(
median
42.5
vs.
64.1
,
p
=
0.25
)
,
whereas
patients
who
developed
high
-
grade
proteinuria
showed
decreased
renal
function
at
the
end
of
follow
-
up
(
median
39.6
vs.
29.2
,
p
=
0.125
)
.

Thus
,
proteinuria
may
develop
in
cardiac
transplant
patients
after
switch
to
Srl
,
which
may
have
an
adverse
effect
on
renal
function
in
these
patients
.

Srl
should
be
used
with
ACEi
/
ARB

therapy
and
patients
monitored
for
proteinuria
and
increased

renal
dysfunction

Methamphetamine
-induced
neurotoxicity
and
microglial
activation
are
not
mediated
by
fractalkine
receptor
signaling
.

Methamphetamine
(
METH
)
damages
dopamine

(
DA
)
nerve
endings
by
a
process
that
has
been
linked
to
microglial
activation
but
the
signaling
pathways
that
mediate
this
response
have
not
yet
been
delineated
.

Cardona
et
al
.

[
Nat
.

(
2006
)
,

]
recently
identified
the
microglial
-
specific
fractalkine
receptor
(
CX3CR1
)
as
an
important
mediator
of
MPTP
-induced
neurodegeneration
of
DA
neurons
.

Because
the
CNS
damage
caused
by
METH
and
MPTP
is
highly
selective
for
the
DA
neuronal
system
in
mouse
models
of
neurotoxicity
,
we
hypothesized
that
the
CX3CR1
plays
a
role
in
METH
-induced
neurotoxicity
and
microglial
activation
.

Mice
in
which
the
CX3CR1
gene
has
been
deleted
and
replaced
with
a
cDNA
encoding
enhanced
green
fluorescent
protein
(
eGFP
)
were
treated
with
METH
and
examined
for
striatal
neurotoxicity
.

METH
depleted

DA
,
caused
microglial
activation
,
and
increased
body
temperature
in
CX3CR1
knockout
mice
to
the
same
extent
and
over
the
same
time
course
seen
in
wild
-
type
controls
.

The
effects
of
METH
in
CX3CR1
knockout
mice
were
not
gender
-
dependent
and
did
not
extend
beyond
the
striatum
.

Striatal
microglia
expressing
eGFP
constitutively
show
morphological
changes
after

METH

that
are
characteristic
of
activation
.

This
response
was
restricted
to
the
striatum
and
contrasted
sharply
with
unresponsive
eGFP
-
microglia
in
surrounding
brain
areas
that
are
not
damaged
by
METH
.

We
conclude
from
these
studies
that
CX3CR1
signaling
does
not
modulate
METH
neurotoxicity
or
microglial
activation
.

Furthermore
,
it
appears
that
striatal
-
resident
microglia
respond
to
METH
with
an
activation
cascade
and
then
return
to
a
surveying
state
without
undergoing
apoptosis
or
migration
.

Recovery

of
the
literature
.

TAC
has
been
shown
to
be
a
potent
immunosuppressive
agent
for
solid
organ
transplantation
in
pediatrics
.

Neurotoxicity
is
a
potentially
serious
toxic
effect
.

It
is
characterized
by
encephalopathy
,
headaches
,
seizures
,
or

deficits
.

Here
,
we
describe
an
eight
-
and
-
a
-
half
-
yr
-
old
male
renal
transplant
recipient
with
right
BN
.

MRI
demonstrated

Valvular
heart
disease
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease
treated
with
pergolide
.

Course
following
treatment
modifications
.

Valvular
heart
abnormalities
have
been
reported
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
treated
with
pergolide
.

However
,
the
incidence
and
severity
of
these
abnormalities
vary
from
study
to
study
and
their
course
after
drug
withdrawal
has
not
been
systematically
assessed
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
estimate
the
frequency
and
severity
of
valvular
heart
abnormality
and
its
possible
reversibility
after
drug
withdrawal
in
a
case
-
control
study
.

METHODS
:

All
PD
patients
in
the
Amiens
area
treated
with
pergolide
were
invited
to
attend
a
cardiologic
assessment
including
transthoracic
echocardiography
.

Thirty
PD

patients
participated
in
the
study
.

A
second
echocardiography
was
performed
(
median
interval
:
13
months
)
after
pergolide
withdrawal
(
n=10
patients
)
.

Controls
were
age-
and
sex
-
matched
non-
PD
patients
referred
to
the
cardiology
department
.

RESULTS
:

Compared
to
controls
,
aortic
regurgitation

(
OR
:
3.1
;
95
%
IC
:
1.1
-
8.8
)
and
mitral
regurgitation

(
OR
:
10.7
;
95
%
IC
:
2.1
-
53
)
were
more
frequent
in
PD
patients
(
tricuspid
:
NS
)
.

The
number
of
affected
valves
(
n=2.4+/-0.7
)
and
the
sum
of
regurgitation
grades
(
n=2.8+/-1.09
)
were
higher
(
p=0.008
and
p=0.006
,
respectively
)
in
the
pergolide
group
.

Severity
of
regurgitation
was
not
correlated
with
pergolide
cumulative
dose
.

A
restrictive
pattern
of
valvular
regurgitation
,
suggestive
of
the
role
of
pergolide
,
was
observed
in
12/30
(
40
%
)

patients
including
two
with
heart
failure
.

Pergolide
was
discontinued
in
10
patients
with
valvular
heart
disease
,
resulting
in
a
lower
regurgitation
grade
(
p=0.01
)
at
the
second
transthoracic
echocardiography
and
the
two
patients
with
heart
failure
returned
to
nearly
normal
clinical
examination
.

This
study
supports
the
high
frequency
of
restrictive
valve
regurgitation
in
PD
patients
treated
with
pergolide
and
reveals
that
a
significant
improvement
is
usual
when
the
treatment
is
converted
to
non
-
ergot
dopamine
agonists
.

Adverse
effects
of
topical
papaverine
on
auditory
nerve
function
.

BACKGROUND
:

Papaverine
hydrochloride
is
a
direct
-
acting
vasodilator
used
to
manage
vasospasm
during
various
neurosurgical
operations
.

Transient
cranial
nerve
dysfunction
has
been
described
in
a
few
cases
with
topical
papaverine
.

This
study
supports
previous
reports
and
provides
neurophysiological
evidence
of
an
adverse
effect
on
the
auditory
nerve
.

METHODS
:
We
conducted
a
retrospective
review
of
70
consecutive
microvascular
decompression
operations
and
studied
those
patients
who
received
topical
papaverine
for
vasospasm
.

Topical
papaverine
was
used
as
a
direct
therapeutic
action
to
manage
vasospasm
in
a
total
of
11
patients
.

The
timing
of
papaverine
application
and
ongoing
operative
events
was
reviewed
relative
to
changes
in
neurophysiological
recordings
.

Brainstem
auditory
evoked
potentials
(
BAEPs
)
were
routinely
used
to
monitor
cochlear
nerve
function
during
these
operations
.

FINDINGS
:

A
temporal
relationship
was
found
between
topical
papaverine
and
BAEP
changes
leading
to
complete
waveform
loss
.

The
average
temporal
delay
between
papaverine
and
the
onset
of
an
adverse
BAEP
change
was
5
min
.

In
10
of
11
patients
,
BAEP
waves
II
/
III
-
V
completely
disappeared
within
2
to
25
min
after
papaverine
.

Eight
of
these
10
patients
had
complete
loss
of
BAEP
waveforms
within
10
min
.

One
patient
showed
no
recovery
of
later
waves
and
a
delayed
profound
sensorineural
hearing
loss
.

The
average
recovery
time
of
BAEP
waveforms
to
pre-

papaverine
baseline
values
was
39
min
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Topical
papaverine
for
the
treatment
of
vasospasm
was
associated
with
the
onset
of
a
transient
disturbance
in
neurophysiological
function
of
the
ascending
auditory
brainstem
pathway
.

The
complete
disappearance
of
BAEP
waveforms
with
a
consistent
temporal
delay
suggests
a
possible
adverse
effect
on
the
proximal
eighth
nerve
.

Recommendations
to
avoid
potential
cranial
nerve
deficits
from
papaverine
are
provided
.

Massive
proteinuria
and
acute
renal
failure
after
oral
bisphosphonate

(
alendronate
)
administration
in
a
patient
with
focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
.

A
61-year
-
old
Japanese
man
with
nephrotic
syndrome
due
to
focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
was
initially
responding
well
to
steroid
therapy
.

The
amount
of
daily
urinary
protein
decreased
from
15.6
to
2.8
g.
Within
14
days
of
the
oral
bisphosphonate

(
alendronate
sodium
)
administration
,
the
amount
of
daily
urinary
protein
increased
rapidly
up
to
12.8
g
with
acute
renal
failure
.

After
discontinuing
the
oral
alendronate
,
the
patient
underwent
six
cycles
of
hemodialysis
and
four
cycles
of
LDL
apheresis
.

Urinary
volume
and
serum
creatinine
levels
recovered
to
the
normal
range
,
with
urinary
protein
disappearing
completely
within
40
days
.

This
report
demonstrates
that
not
only
intravenous
,
but
also
oral
bisphosphonates
can
aggravate
proteinuria
and
acute
renal
failure
.

Serum-

syndrome
.

Doxorubicin
-induced

nephropathy
leads
to
epithelial
sodium

(
ENaC)-dependent
volume
retention
and
renal
fibrosis
.

The
aldosterone
-sensitive
serum-
and
glucocorticoid

inducible
kinase
SGK1
has
been
shown
to
participate
in
the
stimulation
of
ENaC
and
to
mediate
renal
fibrosis
following
mineralocorticoid
and
salt
excess
.

The
present
study
was
performed
to
elucidate
the
role
of
SGK1
in
the
volume
retention
and
fibrosis
during
nephrotic
syndrome
.

To
this
end
,
doxorubicin
(
15

)
was
injected
intravenously
into
gene
-
targeted
mice
lacking
SGK1
(
sgk1(-/-

)
and
their
wild
-
type
littermates
(
sgk1(+/+
)
)
.

Doxorubicin
treatment
resulted
in
heavy
proteinuria

(
>
100
mg

)
in
15/44
of
sgk1(+/+
)
and
15/44
of
sgk1(-/-
)
mice
leading
to
severe
nephrotic
syndrome
with
ascites
,
lipidemia
,
and
hypoalbuminemia
in
both
genotypes
.

Plasma
aldosterone
levels
increased
in
nephrotic
mice
of
both
genotypes
and
was
followed
by
increased
SGK1
protein
expression
in
sgk1(+/+
)
mice
.

Urinary
sodium

reached
signficantly
lower
values
in
sgk1(+/+

than
in
sgk1(-/-

Severe
and
long
lasting
cholestasis
after
high

dose
co
-
trimoxazole
treatment
for
Pneumocystis
pneumonia
in
HIV
-
infected
patients
--
a
report
of
two
cases
.

Pneumocystis
pneumonia
(
PCP
)
,
a
common
opportunistic
infection
in
HIV
-
infected
individuals
,
is
generally
treated
with
high
doses
of
co
-
trimoxazole
.

However
,
treatment
is
often
limited
by
adverse
effects
.

Here
,
we
report
two
cases
of
severely
immunocompromised
HIV
-
infected
patients
who
developed
severe
intrahepatic
cholestasis
,
and
in
one
patient
lesions
mimicking
liver
abscess
formation
on
radiologic
exams
,
during
co
-
trimoxazole
treatment
for
PCP
.

Whereas
patient
1
showed
lesions
of
up
to
1
cm
readily
detectable
on

imaging
under
prolonged
co
-
trimoxazole

.

Clinically
significant
proteinuria
following
the
administration
of

sirolimus
to
renal
transplant
recipients
.

BACKGROUND
:

Sirolimus
is
the
latest
immunosuppressive
agent
used
to
prevent
rejection
,
and
may
have
less
nephrotoxicity
than
calcineurin
inhibitor
(
CNI)-based
regimens
.

To
date
there
has
been
little
documentation
of
clinically
significant
proteinuria
linked
with
the
use
of
sirolimus
.

We
have
encountered
several
patients
who
developed
substantial
proteinuria
associated
with
sirolimus
use
.

In
each
patient
,
the
close
temporal
association
between
the
commencement
of
sirolimus
therapy
and
proteinuria
implicated

sirolimus
as
the
most
likely
etiology
of
the
proteinuria
.

METHODS
:

We
analyzed
the
clinical
and
laboratory
information
available
for
all
119
patients
transplanted
at
the
Washington
Hospital
Center
between
1999
-
2003
for
whom
sirolimus
was
a
component
of
their
immunosuppressant
regimen
.

In
these
patients
,
the
magnitude
of
proteinuria
was
assessed
on
morning
urine
samples
by
turbidometric
measurement
or
random
urine
protein
:
creatinine
ratios
,
an
estimate
of
grams
of
proteinuria
/day
.

Laboratory
results
were
compared
between
prior
,
during
and
following
sirolimus
use
.

RESULTS
:

Twenty
-
eight
patients
(
24
%
)
developed
increased

proteinuria
from
baseline
during
their
post
-
transplantation
course
.

In
21
patients
an
alternative
cause
of
proteinuria
was
either
obvious
or
insufficient
data
was
available
to
be
conclusive
.

In
7
of
the
28
patients
there
was
a
striking
temporal
association
between
the
initiation
of
sirolimus
and
the
development
of
nephrotic
-range
proteinuria
.

Proteinuria
correlated
most
strongly
with
sirolimus
therapy
when
compared
to
other
demographic
and
clinical
variables
.

In
most
patients
,
discontinuation
of
sirolimus
resulted
in
a
decrease
,
but
not
resolution
,
of
proteinuria
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Sirolimus
induces
or
aggravates

pre
-
existing
proteinuria
in
an
unpredictable
subset
of
renal
allograft
recipients
.

Proteinuria
may
improve
,
but
does
not
resolve
,
when
sirolimus
is
withdrawn
.

Comparative
cognitive
and
subjective
side
effects
of
immediate
-
release
oxycodone
in
healthy
middle
-
aged
and
older
adults
.

This
study
measured
the
objective
and
subjective
neurocognitive
effects
of
a
single
10-mg
dose
of
immediate
-
release
oxycodone
in
healthy
,
older
(
>
65
years
)
,
and
middle
-
aged
(
35
to
55
years
)
adults
who
were
not
suffering
from
chronic
or
significant
daily
pain
.

Seventy
-
one
participants
completed
2
separate
study
days
and
were
blind
to
medication
condition
(
placebo
,
10-mg
oxycodone
)
.

Plasma
oxycodone
concentration
peaked
between
60
and
90
minutes
postdose
(
P
.01
)
and
pupil
size
,
an
indication
of
physiological
effects
of
the
medication
,
peaked
at
approximately
90
to
120
minutes
postdose
(
P
.01
)
.

Significant
declines
in
simple
and
sustained
attention
,
working
memory
,
and
verbal
memory
were
observed
at
1
hour
postdose
compared
to
baseline
for
both
age
groups
with
a
trend
toward
return
to
baseline
by
5
hours
postdose
.

For
almost
all
cognitive
measures
,
there
were
no
medication
by
age
-
interaction
effects
,
which
indicates
that
the
2
age
groups
exhibited
similar
responses
to
the
medication
challenge
.

This
study
suggests
that
for
healthy
older
adults
who
are
not
suffering
from
chronic
pain
,
neurocognitive
and
pharmacodynamic
changes
in
response
to
a
10-mg
dose
of
immediate
-
release
oxycodone
are
similar
to
those
observed
for
middle
-
aged
adults
.

PERSPECTIVE
:

Study
findings
indicate
that
the
metabolism
,
neurocognitive
effects
,
and
physical
side
effects
of
oral
oxycodone
are
similar
for
healthy
middle
-
aged
and
older
adults
.

Therefore
,
clinicians
should
not
avoid
prescribing
oral
opioids
to
older
adults
based
on
the
belief
that
older
adults
are
at
higher
risk
for
side
effects
than
younger
adults
.

Normalizing
effects
of
modafinil
on
sleep
in
chronic
cocaine
users
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
morning
-
dosed
modafinil
on
sleep
and
daytime
sleepiness
in
chronic
cocaine
users
.

METHOD
:

Twenty
cocaine

-dependent
participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
modafinil
,
400
mg
(
N=10
)
,
or
placebo
(
N=10
)
every
morning
at
7:30
a.m.
for
16
days
in
an
inpatient
,
double
-
blind
randomized
trial
.

Participants
underwent
polysomnographic
sleep
recordings
on
days
1
to
3
,
7
to
9
,
and
14
to
16
(
first
,
second
,
and
third
weeks
of
abstinence
)
.

The
Multiple
Sleep
Latency
Test
was
performed
at
11:30
a.m.
,
2:00
p.m.
,
and
4:30
p.m.
on
days
2
,
8
,
and
15
.

For
comparison
of
sleep
architecture
variables
,
12
healthy
comparison
participants
underwent
a
single
night
of
experimental
polysomnography
that
followed
1
night
of
accommodation
polysomnography
.

RESULTS
:

Progressive
abstinence
from
cocaine
was
associated
with
worsening
of
all
measured
polysomnographic
sleep
outcomes
.

Compared
with
placebo
,
modafinil
decreased
nighttime
sleep
latency
and
increased
slow
-
wave
sleep
time
in

cocaine

-dependent
participants
.

The
effect
of
modafinil
interacted
with
the
abstinence
week
and
was
associated
with
longer
total
sleep
time
and
shorter
REM
sleep
latency
in
the
third
week
of
abstinence
.

Comparison
of
slow
-
wave
sleep
time
,
total
sleep
time
,
and
sleep
latency
in
cocaine

-dependent
and

healthy
participants
revealed
a
normalizing
effect
of
modafinil
in
cocaine
-dependent
participants
.

Modafinil
was
associated
with
increased
daytime
sleep
latency
,
as
measured
by
the
Multiple
Sleep
Latency
Test
,
and
a
nearly
significant
decrease
in
subjective
daytime
sleepiness
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Morning
-
dosed

modafinil
promotes
nocturnal
sleep
,
normalizes
sleep
architecture
,
and
decreases
daytime
sleepiness
in
abstinent
cocaine
users
.

These
effects
may
be
relevant
in
the
treatment
of
cocaine
dependence
.

Efficacy
and
safety
of
asenapine
in
a
placebo-
and

haloperidol
-controlled
trial
in
patients
with

Asenapine
is

for
acute
treatment
of
schizophrenia
or
of
manic

Permeability
,
ultrastructural
changes
,
and
distribution
of
novel
proteins
in
the
glomerular
barrier
in
early
puromycin
aminonucleoside
nephrosis
.

BACKGROUND
/
AIMS
:

It
is
still
unclear
what
happens
in
the
glomerulus
when
proteinuria
starts
.

Using
puromycin
aminonucleoside
nephrosis
(
PAN
)
rats
,
we
studied
early
ultrastructural
and
permeability
changes
in
relation
to
the
expression
of
the
podocyte
-
associated
molecules
nephrin
,
a
-
actinin
,
dendrin
,
and
plekhh2
,
the
last
two
of
which
were
only
recently
discovered
in
podocytes
.

METHODS
:

Using
immune
stainings
,
semiquantitative
measurement
was
performed
under
the
electron
microscope
.

Permeability
was
assessed
using
isolated
kidney
perfusion
with
tracers
.

Possible
effects
of
ACE
inhibition
were
tested
.

RESULTS
:

By
day
2
,
some
patchy
foot
process
effacement
,
but
no
proteinuria
,
appeared
.

The
amount
of
nephrin
was
reduced
in
both
diseased
and
normal
areas
.

The
other
proteins
showed
few
changes
,
which
were
limited
to
diseased
areas
.

By
day
4
,
foot
process
effacement
was
complete
and
proteinuria
appeared
in
parallel
with
signs
of
size
barrier
damage
.

Nephrin
decreased
further
,
while
dendrin
and
plekhh2
also
decreased
but
a
-
actinin
remained
unchanged
.

ACE
inhibition
had
no
significant
protective
effect
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

PAN
glomeruli
already
showed
significant
pathology
by
day
4
,
despite
relatively
mild
proteinuria
.

This
was
preceded
by
altered
nephrin
expression
,
supporting
its
pivotal
role
in
podocyte
morphology
.

The
novel
proteins
dendrin
and
plekhh2
were
both
reduced
,
suggesting
roles
in
PAN
,
whereas
a
-
actinin
was
unchanged
.

Twin
preterm
neonates
with
cardiac
toxicity
related
to
lopinavir
/
ritonavir
therapy
.

We
report
twin
neonates
who
were
born
prematurely
at
32
weeks
of
gestation
to
a
mother
with
human
immunodeficiency
virus
infection
.

One
of
the
twins
developed
complete
heart
block
and
dilated
cardiomyopathy
related
to
lopinavir
/
ritonavir
therapy
,
a
boosted
protease
-
inhibitor
agent
,
while
the
other
twin
developed
mild
bradycardia
.

We
recommend
caution
in
the
use
of
lopinavir
/
ritonavir
in
the
immediate
neonatal
period
.

Learning
of
rats
under
amnesia
caused
by
pentobarbital
.

Dissociated
learning
of
rats
in
the
normal
state
and
the
state
of
amnesia
produced
by
pentobarbital

(
15
mg
/
kg
,
ip
)
was
carried
out
.

Rats
were
trained
to
approach
a
shelf
where
they
received
food
reinforcement
.

In
Group
1
the
rats
were
trained
under
the
influence
of
pentobarbital
to
run
to
the
same
shelf
as
in
the
normal
state
.

In
Group
2
the
rats
were
trained
to
approach
different
shelves
in
different
drug
states
.

It
was
shown
that
memory
dissociation
occurred
in
both
groups
.

Differences
in
the
parameters
of
training
under
the
influence
of
pentobarbital
between
Groups
1
and
2
were
revealed
.

These
findings
show
that
the
brain
-
dissociated
state
induced
by
pentobarbital
is
formed
with
the
participation
of
the
mechanisms
of
information
perception
.

Angiosarcoma
of
the
liver
associated
with
diethylstilbestrol
.

Angiosarcoma
of
the
liver
occurred
in
a
76-year
-
old
man
who
had
been
treated
for
a
well
-
differentiated
adenocarcinoma
of
the
liver
with
diethylstilbestrol
for
13
years
.

Angiosarcoma
was
also
present
within
pulmonary
and
renal
arteries
.

The
possibility
that
the
intraarterial
lesions
might
represent
independent
primary
tumors
is
considered
.

Role
of

Glucocorticoid

(
GC-
HT
)
in
the
rat
is
associated
with
nitric
oxide

imbalance
.

.

We
studied
the
role
of
xanthine
oxidase
(
XO
)
,
which
is
implicated
in
the
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
,
in
dexamethasone
-induced
hypertension

(
dex
-
HT
)
.

.

Thirty
male
Sprague

rats
were
divided
randomly
into
four
treatment
groups
:
saline
,
dexamethasone

(
dex
)
,

allopurinol
plus
saline
,
and
allopurinol
plus
dex
.
4
.

Systolic
blood
pressures
(
SBP
)
and
bodyweights
were
recorded
each
alternate
day
.

Thymus
weight
was
used
as
a
marker
of
glucocorticoid
activity
,
and
serum
urate
to
assess
XO
inhibition
.

and
decreased

.

Allopurinol
did
not
prevent
dex
-
HT
.

This
,
together
with
our
previous
findings
that
allopurinol
failed
to
prevent
adrenocorticotrophic
hormone
induced
hypertension
,
suggests
that
XO
activity
is
not
a
major
determinant
of
GC-
HT
in
the
rat
.

Extrapyramidal
side
effects
with
risperidone
and
haloperidol
at
comparable
D2
receptor
occupancy
levels
.

Risperidone
is
an
antipsychotic
drug
with
high
affinity
at
dopamine
D2
and
serotonin
5-HT2
receptors
.

Previous
clinical
studies
have
proposed
that
risperidone
's
pharmacologic
profile
may
produce
improved
efficacy
for
negative
psychotic
symptoms
and
decreased
propensity
for
extrapyramidal
side
effects
;
features
shared
by
so
-
called
'
atypical
'
neuroleptics
.

To
determine
if
routine
risperidone
treatment
is
associated
with
a
unique
degree
of
D2
receptor
occupancy
and
pattern
of
clinical
effects
,
we
used
[
123I]IBZM
SPECT
to
determine
D2
occupancy
in
subjects
treated
with
routine
clinical
doses
of
risperidone

(
n
=
12
)
or
haloperidol
(
n
=
7
)
.

Both
risperidone
and
haloperidol
produced
D2
occupancy
levels
between
approximately
60
and
90
%
at
standard
clinical
doses
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
between
occupancy
levels
obtained
with
haloperidol
or
risperidone
.

Drug
-
induced
parkinsonism
was
observed
in
subjects
treated
with
risperidone

(
42
%
)
and
haloperidol
(
29
%
)
and
was
observed
at
occupancy
levels
above
60
%
.

Based
on
these
observations
,
it
is
concluded
that
5-HT2
blockade
obtained
with
risperidone
at
D2
occupancy
rates
of
60
%
and
above
does
not
appear
to
protect
against
the
risk
for
extrapyramidal
side
effects
.

Simvastatin
-
ezetimibe
-induced
hepatic
failure
necessitating
liver
transplantation
.

Abstract
Serum
aminotransferase
elevations
are
a
commonly
known
adverse
effect
of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitor
(
statin
)
therapy
.

However
,
hepatotoxic
events
have
not
been
widely
published
with
ezetimibe
or
the
combination
agent
simvastatin
-
ezetimibe
.

We
describe
a
70-year
-
old
Hispanic
woman
who
developed
fulminant
hepatic
failure
necessitating
liver
transplantation
10
weeks
after
conversion
from
simvastatin

40

mg
/
day
to
simvastatin
10
mg
-
ezetimibe
40
mg
/day
.

The
patient
's
lipid
panel
had
been
maintained
with
simvastatin
for
18
months
before
the
conversion
without
evidence
of
hepatotoxicity
.

A
routine
laboratory
work
-
up

10
weeks
after
conversion
revealed
elevated
serum
aminotransferase
levels
.

Simvastatinezetimibe
and
escitalopram
(
which
she
was
taking
for
depression
)
were
discontinued
,
and
other
potential
causes
of
hepatotoxicity
were
excluded
.

A
repeat
work
-
up
revealed
further
elevations
in
aminotransferase
levels
,
and
liver
biopsy
revealed
evidence
of
moderate
-
to
-
severe
drug
toxicity
.

She
underwent
liver
transplantation
with
an
uneventful
postoperative
course
.

Her
aminotransferase
levels
returned
to
normal
by
postoperative
day
23
,
and
her
2-year
follow
-
up
showed
no
adverse
events
.

Ezetimibe
undergoes
extensive
glucuronidation
by
uridine
diphosphate
glucoronosyltransferases
(
UGT
)
in
the
intestine
and
liver
and
may
have
inhibited
the
glucuronidation
of
simvastatin
hydroxy
acid
,
resulting
in
increased
simvastatin
exposure
and
subsequent
hepatotoxicity
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
case
report
of
simvastatin
-
ezetimibe
-induced

liver
failure
that
resulted
in
liver
transplantation
.

We
postulate
that
the
mechanism
of
the
simvastatinezetimibe
-induced

hepatotoxicity
is
the
increased
simvastatin
exposure
by
ezetimibe
inhibition
of
UGT
enzymes
.

Clinicians
should
be
aware
of
potential
hepatotoxicity
with
simvastatin
-
ezetimibe
especially
in
elderly
patients
and
should
carefully
monitor
serum
aminotransferase
levels
when
starting
therapy
and
titrating
the
dosage
.

Oral
manifestations
of
"
meth
mouth
"
:
a
case
report
.

AIM
:

The
aim
of
the
documentation
of
this
clinical
case
is
to
make
clinicians
aware
of
"
meth
mouth
"
and
the
medical
risks
associated
with
this
serious
condition
.

BACKGROUND
:

Methamphetamine
is
a
very
addictive
,
powerful
stimulant
that
increases
wakefulness
and
physical
activity
and
can
produce
other
effects
such
as
cardiac
dysrhythmias
,
hypertension
,
hallucinations
,
and
violent
behavior
.

Dental
patients
abusing
methamphetamine
can
present
with
poor
oral
hygiene
,
xerostomia
,
rampant
caries
(
"
meth
mouth
")
,
and
excessive
tooth
wear
.

Oral
rehabilitation
of
patients
using
methamphetamine
can
be
challenging
.

CASE
DESCRIPTION
:

A
30-year
-
old
Caucasian
woman
presented
with
dental
pain
,
bad
breath
,
and
self
-
reported
poor
esthetics
.

A
comprehensive
examination
including
her
medical
history
,
panoramic
radiograph
,
and
intraoral
examination
revealed
19
carious
lesions
,
which
is
not
very
common
for
a
healthy
adult
.

She
reported
her
use
of
methamphetamine
for
five
years
and
had
not
experienced
any
major
carious
episodes

before
she
started
using
the
drug
.

SUMMARY
:

The
patient
's
medical
and
dental
histories
along
with
radiographic
and
clinical
findings
lead
to
a
diagnosis
of
"
meth
mouth
.
"

Although
three
different
dental
treatment
modalities
(
either
conventional
or
implant
-
supported
)
have
been
offered
to
the
patient
since
August
2007
,
the
patient
has
yet
to
initiate
any
treatment
.

CLINICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
:

This
clinical
case
showing
oral
manifestations
of
meth
mouth
was
presented
to
help
dental
practitioners
recognize
and
manage
patients
who
may
be
abusing
methamphetamines
.

Dental
practitioners
also
may
be
skeptical
about
the
reliability
of
appointment
keeping
by
these
patients
,
as
they
frequently
miss
their
appointments
without
reasonable
justification
.

Thyroxine
abuse
:
an
unusual
case
of
thyrotoxicosis
in
pregnancy
.

Eating
disorders
and
the
associated
behavioural
problems
and
drug
abuse
are
uncommon
in
pregnancy
.

When
they
do
occur
they
are
often
unrecognized
because
of
denial
but
when
significant
may
pose
a
risk
to
both
the
mother
and
her
fetus
.

This
case
illustrates
a
number
of
problems
that
may
be
encountered
in
women
with
eating
disorders
in
pregnancy
,
including
prolonged
and
recurrent
metabolic
disturbances
and
diuretic
abuse
.

In
particular
it
illustrates
the
derangements
of
thyroid
function
seen
in
pregnant
women
with
eating
disorders
and
reminds
us
that
when
a
cause
for
thyrotoxicosis
remains
obscure
,
thyroxine
abuse
should
be
considered
and
explored
.

Attenuation
of
methamphetamine
-induced

nigrostriatal
dopaminergic
neurotoxicity
in
mice
by
lipopolysaccharide
pretreatment
.

Immunological
activation
has
been
proposed
to
play
a
role
in
methamphetamine

-induced

dopaminergic
terminal
damage
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
roles
of
lipopolysaccharide
,
a
pro
-
inflammatory
and
inflammatory
factor
,
treatment
in
modulating
the
methamphetamine
-induced
nigrostriatal
dopamine
neurotoxicity
.

Lipopolysaccharide
pretreatment
did
not
affect
the
basal
body
temperature
or
methamphetamine
-elicited

hyperthermia
three
days
later
.

Such
systemic
lipopolysaccharide
treatment
mitigated

methamphetamine
-induced
striatal
dopamine
and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid
depletions
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

As
the
most
potent
dose
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
of

lipopolysaccharide
was
administered
two
weeks
,
one
day
before
or
after
the
methamphetamine
dosing
regimen
,
methamphetamine
-induced
striatal
dopamine
and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid
depletions
remained
unaltered
.

Moreover
,
systemic
lipopolysaccharide
pretreatment
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
attenuated
local
methamphetamine
infusion
-
produced
dopamine
and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid
depletions
in
the
striatum
,
indicating
that
the
protective
effect
of
lipopolysaccharide
is
less
likely
due
to
interrupted
peripheral
distribution
or
metabolism
of
methamphetamine
.

We
concluded
a
critical
time
window
for
systemic
lipopolysaccharide
pretreatment
in
exerting
effective
protection
against
methamphetamine
-induced
nigrostriatal
dopamine
neurotoxicity
.

Butyrylcholinesterase
gene
mutations
in
patients
with
prolonged
apnea
after
succinylcholine
for
electroconvulsive
therapy
.

BACKGROUND
:

patients
undergoing
electroconvulsive
therapy
(
ECT
)
often
receive
succinylcholine
as
part
of
the
anesthetic
procedure
.

The
duration
of
action
may
be
prolonged
in
patients
with
genetic
variants
of
the
butyrylcholinesterase
enzyme
(
BChE
)
,
the
most
common
being
the
K-
and
the
A
-
variants
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
assess
the
clinical
significance
of
genetic
variants
in
butyrylcholinesterase
gene
(
BCHE
)
in
patients
with
a
suspected
prolonged
duration
of
action
of
succinylcholine
after
ECT
.

METHODS
:
a
total
of
13
patients
were
referred
to
the
Danish
Cholinesterase
Research
Unit
after
ECT
during
38
months
.

We
determined
the
BChE
activity
and
the
BCHE
genotype
using
molecular
genetic
methods
,
the
duration
of
apnea
,
time
to
sufficient
spontaneous
ventilation
and
whether
neuromuscular
monitoring
was
used
.

The
duration
of
apnea
was
compared
with
published
data
on
normal
subjects
.

RESULTS
:

in
11
patients
,
mutations
were
found
in
the
BCHE
gene
,
the
K
-
variant
being
the
most
frequent
.

The
duration
of
apnea
was
5
-
15
min
compared
with
3
-
5.3
min
from
the
literature
.

Severe
distress
was
noted
in
the
recovery
phase
in
two
patients
.

Neuromuscular
monitoring
was
used
in
two
patients
.

CONCLUSION
:

eleven
of
13
patients
with
a
prolonged
duration
of
action
of
succinylcholine
had
mutations
in
BCHE
,
indicating
that
this
is
the
possible
reason
for
a
prolonged
period
of
apnea
.

We
recommend
objective
neuromuscular
monitoring
during
the
first
ECT
.

Ketamine
sedation
for
the
reduction
of
children
's
fractures
in
the
emergency
department
.

BACKGROUND
:

There
recently
has
been
a
resurgence
in
the
utilization
of
ketamine
,
a
unique
anesthetic
,
for
emergency
-
department
procedures
requiring
sedation
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
examine
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
ketamine
for
sedation
in
the
treatment
of
children
's
fractures
in
the
emergency
department
.

METHODS
:

One
hundred
and
fourteen
children
(
average
age
,
5.3
years
;
range
,
twelve
months
to
ten
years
and
ten
months
)
who
underwent
closed
reduction
of
an
isolated
fracture
or
dislocation
in
the
emergency
department
at
a
level
-

I

trauma
center
were
prospectively
evaluated
.

Ketamine
hydrochloride
was
administered
intravenously
(
at
a
dose
of
two
milligrams
per
kilogram
of
body
weight
)
in
ninety
-
nine
of
the
patients
and

intramuscularly
(
at
a
dose
of
four
milligrams
per
kilogram
of
body
weight
)
in
the
other
fifteen
.

A
board
-
certified
emergency
physician
skilled
in
airway
management
supervised
administration
of
the
anesthetic
,
and
the
patients
were
monitored
by
a
registered
nurse
.

Any
pain
during
the
reduction
was
rated
by
the
orthopaedic
surgeon
treating
the
patient
according
to
the
Children
's
Hospital
of
Eastern
Ontario
Pain
Scale
(
CHEOPS
)
.

RESULTS
:

The
average
time
from
intravenous
administration
of
ketamine
to
manipulation
of
the
fracture
or
dislocation
was
one
minute
and
thirty
-
six
seconds
(
range
,
twenty
seconds
to
five
minutes
)
,
and
the
average
time
from
intramuscular
administration
to
manipulation
was
four
minutes
and
forty
-
two
seconds
(
range
,
sixty
seconds
to
fifteen
minutes
)
.

The
average
score
according
to
the
Children
's
Hospital
of
Eastern
Ontario
Pain
Scale
was
6.4
points
(
range
,
5
to
10
points
)
,
reflecting
minimal
or
no
pain
during
fracture
reduction
.

Adequate
fracture
reduction
was
obtained
in
111
of
the
children
.

Ninety
-
nine
percent
(
sixty
-
eight
)
of
the
sixty
-
nine
parents
present
during
the
reduction
were
pleased
with
the
sedation
and
would
allow
it
to
be
used
again
in
a
similar
situation
.

Patency
of
the
airway
and
independent
respiration
were
maintained
in
all
of
the
patients
.

Blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
remained
stable
.

Minor
side
effects
included
nausea

(
thirteen
patients
)
,

emesis
(
eight
of
the
thirteen
patients
with
nausea
)
,
clumsiness
(
evident
as
ataxic
movements
in
ten
patients
)
,
and
dysphoric
reaction
(
one
patient
)
.

No
long
-
term
sequelae
were
noted
,
and
no
patients
had
hallucinations
or
nightmares
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Ketamine
reliably
,
safely
,
and
quickly
provided
adequate
sedation
to
effectively
facilitate
the
reduction
of
children
's
fractures
in
the
emergency
department
at
our
institution
.

Ketamine
should
only
be
used
in
an
environment
such
as
the
emergency
department
,
where
proper
one
-
on
-
one
monitoring
is
used
and
board
-
certified
physicians
skilled
in
airway
management
are
directly
involved
in
the
care
of
the
patient
.

Prophylactic
use
of
lamivudine
with
chronic
immunosuppressive
therapy
for
rheumatologic
disorders
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
report
our
experience
concerning
the
effectiveness
of
the
prophylactic
administration
of
lamivudine
in
hepatitis
B
virus
surface
antigen

(
HBs
Ag
)
positive
patients
with
rheumatologic
disease
.

From
June
2004
to
October
2006
,
11
HBs
Ag
positive
patients
with
rheumatologic
diseases
,
who
were
on
both
immunosuppressive
and
prophylactic
lamivudine
therapies
,
were
retrospectively
assessed
.

Liver
function
tests
,
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
serologic
markers
,
and
HBV
DNA
levels
of
the
patients
during
follow
-
up
were
obtained
from
hospital
file
records
.

Eleven
patients
(
six
male
)
with
median
age
47
years
(
range
27
-
73
)
,
median
disease
duration
50
months
(
range
9
-
178
)
and
median
follow
-
up
period
of
patients
13.8
months
(
range
5
-
27
)
were
enrolled
in
this
study
.

Lamivudine
therapy
was
started
3
-
7
days
prior
to
immunosuppressive
therapy
in
all
patients
.

Baseline
,
liver
function
tests
were
elevated
in
two
patients
(
fourth
patient
:

ALT:122
IU
/
l
,
AST:111
IU
/
l
,
tenth
patient
:
ALT:294

IU
/
l

,
AST:274
IU
/
l
,
with
minimal
changes
in
the
liver
biopsy
in
both
)
.

Shortly
after
treatment
their
tests
normalized
and
during
follow
-
up
period
none
of
the
patients
had
abnormal
liver
function
tests
.

In
four
patients
HBV
DNA
levels
were
higher
than
normal
at
baseline
.

Two
of
these
normalized
and
the
others
increased
later
.

In
three
additional
patients
,
HBV
DNA
levels
were
increased
during
follow
-
up
.

None
of
the
patients
had
significant
clinical
sings
of
HBV
activation
.

Lamivudine
was
well
tolerated
and
was
continued
in
all
patients
.

Prophylactic
administration
of
lamivudine
in
patients
who
required
immunosuppressive
therapy
seems
to
be
safe
,
well
tolerated
and
effective
in
preventing
HBV
reactivation
.

Safety
of

BACKGROUND
:

TEE
is
a
semi

associated
to
moderate
sedation
.

We
analyzed
the
following
events
:
complications
related
with
the
topical
anesthesia
,
with
MZ
use
and
with
the
procedure
.

Uni-
and
multivariate
analyses
were
used
to
test
the
influence
of
the
clinical
variables
:
age
,
sex
,
stroke
,
myocardiopathy

(
MP
)
,
duration
of
the
test
,
mitral
regurgitation

(
MR
)
and
the
MZ
dose
.

RESULTS
:

All
patients
(
65+/-16
yrs
;
58
%
males
)
finished
the
examination
.

The
mean
doses
of
MZ
and
FL
were
4.3+/-1.9
mg
and
0.28+/-0.2
mg
,
respectively
.

The
duration
of
the
examination
and
the
mean
ejection
fraction
(
EF
)
were
16.4+/-6.1
minutes
and
60+/-9
%
,
respectively
.

Mild
hypoxia

(
SO2<90
%
)
was
the
most
common
event
(
11
patients
)
;
3
patients
(
2
%
)
presented
transient
hypoxia
due
to
upper
airway
obstruction
by
probe
introduction
and
8
(
5.8
%
)
due
to
hypoxia
caused
by
MZ
use
.

Transient
hypotension

(
SAP<90mmHg
)
occurred
in
1
patient
(
0.7
%
)
.

The
multivariate
analysis
showed
that
severe
MR
,
MP
(
EF<45
%
)
and
high
doses
of
MZ

(
>
5
mg
)
were
associated
with
events
(
p<0.001
)
.

The
EF
was
40
%
,
in
the
group
with
MP
and
44
%
in
the
group
with
severe
MR

and
it
can
be
a
factor
associated
with
clinical
events
in
the
last
group
.

CONCLUSION
:

TEE
with
sedation
presents
a
low
rate
of
events
.

There
were
no
severe
events
and
there
was
no
need
to
interrupt
the
examinations
.

Effects
of
calcium
channel
blockers
on
bupivacaine
-induced
toxicity
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
influence
of
calcium
channel
blockers
on
bupivacaine
-induced
acute
toxicity
.

For
each
of
the
three
tested
calcium
channel
blockers
(
diltiazem
,
verapamil
and
bepridil
)
6
groups
of
mice
were
treated
by
two
different
doses
,
i.e.
2
and
10
mg
/
kg
/
i.p
.
,
or
an
equal
volume
of
saline
for
the
control
group
(
n
=
20
)
;
15
minutes
later
,
all
the
animals
were
injected
with
a
single
50
mg
/
kg
/
i.p
.

dose
of
bupivacaine
.

The
convulsant
activity
,
the
time
of
latency
to
convulse
and
the
mortality
rate
were
assessed
in
each
group
.

The
local
anesthetic
-
induced
mortality
was
significantly
increased
by
the
three
different
calcium
channel
blockers
.

The
convulsant
activity
of
bupivacaine
was
not
significantly
modified
but
calcium
channel
blockers
decreased
the
time
of
latency
to
obtain
bupivacaine
-induced
convulsions
;
this
effect
was
less
pronounced
with
bepridil
.

Selegiline
-induced
postural
hypotension
in
Parkinson
's
disease
:
a
longitudinal
study
on
the
effects
of
drug
withdrawal
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
United
Kingdom
Parkinson
's
Disease
Research
Group
(
UKPDRG
)
trial
found
an
increased
mortality
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
randomized
to
receive
10
mg
selegiline
per
day
and
L
-
dopa
compared
with
those
taking
L
-
dopa
alone
.

Recently
,
we
found
that
therapy
with
selegiline
and
L
-
dopa
was
associated
with
selective
systolic
orthostatic
hypotension
which
was
abolished
by
withdrawal
of
selegiline
.

This
unwanted
effect
on
postural
blood
pressure
was
not
the
result
of
underlying
autonomic
failure
.

The
aims
of
this
study
were
to
confirm
our
previous
findings
in
a
separate
cohort
of
patients
and
to
determine
the
time
course
of
the
cardiovascular
consequences
of
stopping
selegiline
in
the
expectation
that
this
might
shed
light
on
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
drug
causes

orthostatic
hypotension
.

METHODS
:

The
cardiovascular
responses
to
standing
and
head
-
up
tilt
were
studied
repeatedly
in
PD
patients
receiving
selegiline
and
as
the
drug
was
withdrawn
.

RESULTS
:

Head
-
up
tilt
caused

systolic
orthostatic
hypotension
which
was
marked
in
six
of
20
PD
patients
on
selegiline
,
one
of
whom
lost
consciousness
with
unrecordable
blood
pressures
.

A
lesser
degree
of
orthostatic
hypotension
occurred
with
standing
.

Orthostatic
hypotension
was
ameliorated
4
days
after
withdrawal
of
selegiline
and
totally
abolished
7
days
after
discontinuation
of
the
drug
.

Stopping
selegiline
also
significantly

reduced
the
supine
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
consistent
with
a
previously
undescribed
supine
pressor
action
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
study
confirms
our
previous
finding
that
selegiline
in
combination
with
L
-
dopa
is
associated
with
selective
orthostatic
hypotension
.

The
possibilities
that
these
cardiovascular
findings
might
be
the
result
of
non
-
selective
inhibition
of
monoamine
oxidase
or
of
amphetamine
and
metamphetamine
are
discussed
.

Explicit
episodic
memory
for
sensory
-
discriminative
components
of
capsaicin

-induced

pain
:
immediate
and
delayed
ratings
.

Pain
memory
is
thought
to
affect
future
pain
sensitivity
and
thus
contribute
to
clinical
pain
conditions
.

Systematic
investigations
of
the
human
capacity
to
remember
sensory
features
of
experimental
pain
are
sparse
.

In
order
to
address
long
-
term
pain
memory
,
nine
healthy
male
volunteers
received
intradermal
injections
of
three
doses
of
capsaicin

(
0.05
,
1
and
20
microg
,
separated
by
15
min
breaks
)
,
each
given
three
times
in
a
balanced
design
across
three
sessions
at
one
week
intervals
.

Pain
rating
was
performed
using
a
computerized
visual
analogue
scale
(
0
-
100
)
digitized
at
1/s
,
either
immediately
online
or
one
hour
or
one
day
after
injection
.

Subjects
also
recalled
their
pains
one
week
later
.

Capsaicin
injection
reliably
induced
a
dose
-
dependent
flare
(
p<0.001
)
without
any
difference
within
or
across
sessions
.

The
strong
burning

pain
decayed
exponentially
within
a
few
minutes
.

Subjects
were
able
to
reliably
discriminate
pain
magnitude
and
duration
across
capsaicin
doses
(
both
p<0.001
)
,
regardless
of
whether
first
-
time
ratings
were
requested
immediately
,
after
one
hour
or
after
one
day
.

Pain
recall
after
one
week
was
similarly
precise
(
magnitude
:
p<0.01
,
duration
:
p<0.05
)
.

Correlation
with
rating
recall
after
one
week
was
best
when
first
-
time
ratings
were
requested
as
late
as
one
day
after
injection
(

R(2)=0.79
)
indicating
that
both
rating
retrievals
utilized
similar
memory
traces
.

These
results
indicate
a
reliable
memory
for
magnitude
and
duration
of
experimentally
induced
pain
.

The
data
further
suggest
that
the
consolidation
of
this
memory
is
an
important
interim
stage
,
and
may
take
up
to
one
day
.

Reversibility
of
captopril

-induced

renal
insufficiency
after
prolonged
use
in
an
unusual
case
of
renovascular
hypertension
.

We
report
a
case
of
severe
hypertension
with
an
occluded
renal
artery
to
a
solitary
kidney
,
who
developed
sudden
deterioration
of
renal
function
following
treatment
with
captopril
.

His
renal
function
remained
impaired
but
stable
during
2
years
'
treatment
with
captopril
but
returned
to
pre
-
treatment
levels
soon
after
cessation
of
the
drug
.

This
indicates
reversibility
in
captopril

-induced

renal
failure
even
after
its
prolonged
use
and
suggests
that
no
organic
damage
occurs
to
glomerular
arterioles
following
chronic
ACE
inhibition
.

Liver
disease
caused
by
propylthiouracil
.

This
report
presents
the
clinical
,
laboratory
,
and
light
and
electron
microscopic
observations
on
a
patient
with
chronic
active
(
aggressive
)
hepatitis
caused
by
the
administration
of
propylthiouracil
.

This
is
an
addition
to
the
list
of
drugs
that
must
be
considered
in
the
evaluation
of
chronic
liver
disease
.

Capsaicin
-induced
muscle
pain
alters
the
excitability
of
the
human
jaw
-
stretch
reflex
.

The
pathophysiology
of
painful
temporomandibular
disorders
is
not
fully
understood
,
but
evidence
suggests
that
muscle
pain
modulates
motor
function
in
characteristic
ways
.

This
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
activation
of
nociceptive
muscle
afferent
fibers
would
be
linked
to
an
increased
excitability
of
the
human
jaw
-
stretch
reflex
and
whether
this
process
would
be
sensitive
to
length
and
velocity
of
the
stretch
.

Capsaicin
(
10
micro
g
)
was
injected
into
the
masseter
muscle
to
induce
pain
in
11
healthy
volunteers
.

Short
-
latency
reflex
responses
were
evoked
in
the
masseter
and
temporalis
muscles
by
a
stretch
device
with
different
velocities
and
displacements
before
,
during
,
and
after
the
pain
.

The
normalized
reflex
amplitude
increased
with
an
increase
in
velocity
at
a
given
displacement
,
but
remained
constant
with
different
displacements
at
a
given
velocity
.

The
normalized
reflex
amplitude
was
significantly
higher
during
pain
,
but
only
at
faster
stretches
in
the
painful
muscle
.

Increased
sensitivity
of
the
fusimotor
system
during
acute
muscle
pain
could
be
one
likely
mechanism
to
explain
the
findings
.

Repetitive
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
for
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
in
Parkinson
's
disease
.

In
a
placebo
-
controlled
,
single
-
blinded
,
crossover
study
,
we
assessed
the
effect
of
"
real
"
repetitive
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
(
rTMS
)
versus
"
sham
"
rTMS
(
placebo
)
on
peak
dose
dyskinesias
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
.

Ten
patients
with
PD
and
prominent
dyskinesias
had
rTMS
(
1,800
pulses
;
1
Hz
rate
)
delivered
over
the
motor
cortex
for
4
consecutive
days
twice
,
once
real
stimuli
and
once
sham
stimulation
were
used
;
evaluations
were
done
at
the
baseline
and
1
day
after
the
end
of
each
of
the
treatment
series
.

Direct
comparison
between
sham
and
real
rTMS
effects
showed
no
significant
difference
in
clinician
-
assessed
dyskinesia
severity
.

However
,
comparison
with
the
baseline
showed
small
but
significant
reduction
in
dyskinesia
severity
following
real
rTMS
but
not
placebo
.

The
major
effect
was
on
dystonia
subscore
.

Similarly
,
in
patient
diaries
,
although
both
treatments
caused
reduction
in
subjective
dyskinesia
scores
during
the
days
of
intervention
,
the
effect
was
sustained
for
3
days
after
the
intervention
for
the
real
rTMS
only
.

Following
rTMS
,
no
side
effects
and
no
adverse
effects
on
motor
function
and
PD
symptoms
were
noted
.

The
results
suggest
the
existence
of
residual
beneficial
clinical
aftereffects
of
consecutive
daily
applications
of
low
-
frequency
rTMS
on
dyskinesias
in
PD
.

The
effects
may
be
further
exploited
for
potential
therapeutic
uses
.

Disulfiram
-like
syndrome
after
hydrogen
cyanamide
professional
skin
exposure
:
two
case
reports
in
France
.

Hydrogen
cyanamide
is
a
plant
growth
regulator
used
in
agriculture
to
induce
bud
break
in
fruit
trees
.

Contact
with
the
skin
can
result
in
percutaneous
absorption
of
the
substance
that
inhibits
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
and
can
induce
acetaldehyde
syndrome
in
case
of
alcohol
use
.

The
purpose
of
this
report
is
to
describe
two
cases
of
a
disulfiram
-like
syndrome
following
occupational
exposure
to
hydrogen
cyanamide
.

The
first
case
involved
a
59-year
-
old
man
who
used
Dormex
,
which
contains
hydrogen
cyanamide
,
without
protection
after
consuming
a
large
amount
of
alcohol
during
a
meal
.

In
less
than
1
hour
after
the
ingestion
of
alcohol
,
he
developed
malaise
with
flushing
of
the
face
,
tachycardia
,
and
dyspnea
.

Manifestations
regressed
spontaneously
under
surveillance
in
the
hospital
.

The
second
case
occurred
in
a
55-year
-
old
farmer
following
cutaneous
contact
with
Dormex
.

Five
hours
after
exposure
,
he
developed

disulfiram
-like
syndrome
with
flushing
,
tachycardia
,
and
arterial
hypotension
after
consuming
three
glasses
of
wine
.

The
patient
recovered
spontaneously
in
3
hours
under
surveillance
in
the
hospital
.

These
cases
confirm
the
necessity
of
avoiding
alcohol
consumption
as
recommended
in
the
instructions
for
use
of
Dormex
and
of
preventing
cutaneous
contact
during
use
.

Repeated
trimipramine
induces
dopamine

D2/D3
and
alpha1-adrenergic
up
-
regulation
.

Trimipramine
(
TRI
)
,
which
shows
a
clinical
antidepressant
activity
,
is
chemically
related
to
imipramine
but
does
not
inhibit
the
reuptake
of
noradrenaline
and
5-hydroxytryptamine
,
nor
does
it
induce
beta
-
adrenergic
down
-
regulation
.

The
mechanism
of
its
antidepressant
activity
is
still
unknown
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
find
out
whether
TRI

given
repeatedly
was
able
to
induce
adaptive
changes
in
the
dopaminergic
and
alpha1-adrenergic
systems
,
demonstrated
by
us
previously
for
various
antidepressants
.

TRI
was
given
to
male
Wistar
rats
and
male
Albino
Swiss
mice
perorally
twice
daily
for
14
days
.

In
the
acute
experiment
TRI
(
given
i.p
.
)
does
not
antagonize
the
reserpine
hypothermia
in
mice
and
does
not
potentiate
the
5-hydroxytryptophan
head
twitches
in
rats
.

TRI
given
repeatedly
to
rats
increases
the
locomotor
hyperactivity
induced
by
d
-
amphetamine
,
quinpirole
and

(
+
)
-7-hydroxy
-
dipropyloaminotetralin
(
dopamine
D2
and
D3
effects
)
.

The
stereotypies
induced
by
d
-
amphetamine
or
apomorphine
are
not
potentiated
by
TRI
.

It
increases
the
behaviour
stimulation
evoked
by
phenylephrine

(
given
intraventricularly
)
in
rats
,
evaluated
in
the
open
field
test
as
well
as
the
aggressiveness
evoked
by
clonidine
in
mice
,
both
these
effects
being
mediated
by
an
alpha1-adrenergic
receptor
.

It
may
be
concluded
that
,
like
other
tricyclic

antidepressants
studied
previously
,

TRI
given
repeatedly
increases
the
responsiveness
of
brain
dopamine
D2
and
D3
(
locomotor
activity
but
not
stereotypy
)
as
well
as
alpha1-adrenergic
receptors
to
their
agonists
.

A
question
arises
whether
the
reuptake
inhibition
is
of
any
importance
to
the
adaptive
changes
induced
by
repeated
antidepressants
,
suggested
to
be
responsible
for
the
antidepressant
activity
.

Ranitidine
-induced
acute
interstitial
nephritis
in
a
cadaveric
renal
allograft
.

Ranitidine
frequently
is
used
for
preventing
peptic
ulceration
after
renal
transplantation
.

This
drug
occasionally
has
been
associated
with
acute
interstitial
nephritis
in
native
kidneys
.

There
are
no
similar
reports
with
renal
transplantation
.

We
report
a
case
of
ranitidine
-induced
acute
interstitial
nephritis
in
a
recipient
of
a
cadaveric
renal
allograft
presenting
with
acute
allograft
dysfunction
within
48
hours
of
exposure
to
the
drug
.

The
biopsy
specimen
showed
pathognomonic
features
,
including
eosinophilic
infiltration
of
the
interstitial
compartment
.

Allograft
function
improved
rapidly
and
returned
to
baseline
after
stopping
the
drug
.

Late
,
late
doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity
.

Cardiac
toxicity
is
a
major
complication
which
limits
the
use
of
adriamycin
as
a
chemotherapeutic
agent
.

Cardiomyopathy
is
frequent
when
the
total
dose
exceeds
600
mg
/
m2
and
occurs
within
one
to
six
months
after
cessation
of
therapy
.

A
patient
is
reported
who
developed
progressive
cardiomyopathy
two
and
one
-
half
years
after
receiving
580
mg
/
m2
which
apparently
represents
late
,
late
cardiotoxicity
.

Acetazolamide
-induced
nephrolithiasis
:
implications
for
treatment
of
neuromuscular
disorders
.

Carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitors
can
cause
nephrolithiasis
.

We
studied
20
patients
receiving
long
-
term
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitor
treatment
for
periodic
paralysis
and
myotonia
.

Three
patients
on
acetazolamide

(
15
%
)
developed

renal
calculi
.

Extracorporeal
lithotripsy
successfully
removed
a
renal
calculus
in
one
patient
and
surgery
removed
a
staghorn
calculus
in
another
,
permitting
continued
treatment
.

Renal
function
remained
normal
in
all
patients
.

Nephrolithiasis
is
a
complication
of
acetazolamide
but
does
not
preclude
its
use
.

Is
the
treatment
of
scabies
hazardous
?

Treatment
for
scabies
is
usually
initiated
by
general
practitioners
;
most
consider
lindane

(
gamma
benzene
hexachloride
)
the
treatment
of
choice
.

Lindane
is
also
widely
used
as
an
agricultural
and
industrial
pesticide
,
and
as
a
result
the
toxic
profile
of
this
insecticide
is
well
understood
.

Evidence
is
accumulating
that
lindane
can
be
toxic
to
the
central
nervous
system
and
may
be
associated
with
aplastic
anaemia
.

Preparations
containing
lindane
continue
to
be
sold
over
the
counter
and
may
represent
a
hazard
to
poorly
informed
patients
.

This
literature
review
suggests
that
general
practitioners
should
prescribe
scabicides
with
increased
caution
for
certain
at
-
risk
groups
,
and
give
adequate
warnings
regarding
potential
toxicity
.

Anaesthetists
'
nightmare
:
masseter
spasm
after
induction
in
an
undiagnosed
case
of
myotonia
congenita
.

We
report
an
undiagnosed
case
of
myotonia
congenita
in
a
24-year
-
old
previously
healthy
primigravida
,
who
developed
life
threatening
masseter
spasm
following
a
standard
dose
of
intravenous
suxamethonium
for
induction
of
anaesthesia
.

Neither
the
patient
nor
the
anaesthetist
was
aware
of
the
diagnosis
before
this
potentially
lethal
complication
occurred
.

Toxicity
in
rhesus
monkeys
following
administration
of
the
8-aminoquinoline
8-[(4-amino
-
l
-
methylbutyl)amino]-
5-(l
-
hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline

(
WR242511
)
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Many
substances
that
form
methemoglobin
(
MHb
)
effectively
counter
cyanide
(
CN
)

toxicity
.

Although
MHb
formers
are
generally
applied
as
treatments
for
CN
poisoning
,
it
has
been
proposed
that
a
stable
,
long
-
acting
MHb
former
could
serve
as
a
CN
pretreatment
.

Using
this
rationale
,
the
8-aminoquinoline
WR242511
,
a
potent
long
-
lasting
MHb
former
in
rodents
and
beagle
dogs
,
was
studied
in
the
rhesus
monkey
for
advanced
development
as
a
potential
CN
pretreatment
.

METHODS
:

In
this
study
,
WR242511
was
administered
intravenously
(
IV
)
in
2
female
and
4
male
rhesus
monkeys
in
doses
of
3.5
and/or
7.0
mg
/
kg
;
a
single
male
also
received
WR242511

orally
(
PO
)
at
7.0
mg
/
kg
.

Health
status
and
MHb
levels
were
monitored
following
exposure
.

RESULTS
:

The
selected
doses
of
WR242511
,
which
produced
significant
methemoglobinemia
in
beagle
dogs
in
earlier
studies
conducted
elsewhere
,
produced
very
little
MHb
(
mean
2.0
%
)
in
the
rhesus
monkey
.

Furthermore
,
transient
hemoglobinuria
was
noted
approximately
60
minutes
postinjection
of
WR242511

(
3.5
or
7.0
mg
/
kg
)
,
and
2
lethalities
occurred
(
one
IV
and
one
PO
)
following
the
7.0
mg
/
kg
dose
.

Myoglobinuria
was
also
observed
following
the
7.0
mg
/
kg
dose
.

Histopathology
analyses
in
the
2
animals
that
died
revealed
liver
and
kidney
toxicity
,
with
greater
severity
in
the
orally
-
treated
animal
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
data
demonstrate
direct
and/or
indirect
drug
-
induced
toxicity
.

It
is
concluded
that
WR242511
should
not
be
pursued
as
a
pretreatment
for
CN
poisoning
unless
the
anti
-
CN
characteristics
of
this
compound
can
be
successfully
dissociated
from
those
producing
undesirable
toxicity
.

Neuroplasticity
of
the
adult
primate
auditory
cortex
following
cochlear
hearing
loss
.

Tonotopic
organization
is
an
essential
feature
of
the
primary
auditory
area
(
A1
)
of
primate
cortex
.

In
A1
of
macaque
monkeys
,
low
frequencies
are
represented
rostrolaterally
and
high
frequencies
are
represented
caudomedially
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
changes
occur
in
this
tonotopic
organization
following
cochlear
hearing
loss
.

Under
anesthesia
,
the
superior
temporal
gyrus
of
adult
macaque
monkeys
was
exposed
,
and
the
tonotopic
organization
of
A1
was
mapped
using
conventional
microelectrode
recording
techniques
.

Following
recovery
,
the
monkeys
were
selectively
deafened
for
high
frequencies
using
kanamycin
and
furosemide
.

The
actual
frequencies
deafened
were
determined
by
the
loss
of
tone
-
burst
elicited
auditory
brainstem
responses
.

Three
months
after
deafening
,
A1
was
remapped
.

Postmortem
cytoarchitectural
features
identifying
A1
were
correlated
with
the
electrophysiologic
data
.

The
results
indicate
that
the
deprived
area
of
A1
undergoes
extensive
reorganization
and
becomes
responsive
to
intact
cochlear
frequencies
.

The
region
of
cortex
that
represents
the
low
frequencies
was
not
obviously
affected
by
the
cochlear
hearing
loss
.

The
site
of
common
side
effects
of
sumatriptan
.

Atypical
sensations
following
the
use
of
subcutaneous
sumatriptan
are
common
,
but
of
uncertain
origin
.

They
are
almost
always
benign
,
but
can
be
mistaken
for
a
serious
adverse
event
by
the
patient
.

Two
patients
are
presented
with
tingling
or
burning
sensations
limited
to
areas
of
heat
exposure
or
sunburn
.

In
these
individuals
,
side
effects
are
most
likely
generated
superficially
in
the
skin
.

Tremor
side
effects
of
salbutamol
,
quantified
by
a
laser
pointer
technique
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
study
tremor
side
effects
of

salbutamol
an
easily
applicable
,
quick
and
low
-
priced
method
is
needed
.

A
new
method
using
a
commercially
available
,
pen
-
shaped
laser
pointer
was
developed
.

Aim
of
the
study
was
to
determine
sensitivity
,
reproducibility
,
reference
values
and
the
agreement
with
a
questionnaire
.

METHODS
:

Tremor
was
measured
using
a
laser
pointer
technique
.

To
determine
sensitivity
we
assessed

tremor
in
44
patients
with
obstructive
lung
disease

after
administration
of
cumulative
doses
of
salbutamol
.

Subjects
were
asked
to
aim
at
the
centre
of
a
target
,
subdivided
in
concentric
circles
,
from
5
m
distance
.

The
circle
in
which
the
participant
succeeded
to
aim
was
recorded
in
millimetres
radius
.

In
another
series
of
measurements
,
reproducibility
and
reference
values
of
the
tremor
was
assessed
in
65
healthy
subjects
in
three
sessions
,
at
9
a.m.
,
4
p.m.
and
9
a.m.
,
respectively
,
1
week
later
.

Postural
tremor
was
measured
with
the
arm
horizontally
outstretched
rest
tremor
with
the
arm
supported
by
an
armrest
and
finally
tremor
was
measured
after
holding
a
2-kg
weight
until
exhaustion
.

Inter
-
observer
variability
was
measured
in
a
series
of
10
healthy
subjects
.

Tremor
was
measured
simultaneously
by
two
independent
observers
.

RESULTS
:

Salbutamol
significantly
increased
tremor
severity
in
patients
in
a
dose
-
dependent
way
.

Within
healthy
adults
no
age
-
dependency
could
be
found
(
b
=
0.262
mm
/
year
;
P
=
0.72
)
.

There
was
no
agreement
between
the
questionnaire
and
tremor
severity
(
r
=
0.093
;
P
=
0.53
)
.

Postural
tremor
showed
no
significant
difference
between
the
first
and
third
session
(
P
=
0.07
)
.

Support
of
the
arm
decreased
tremor
severity
,
exhaustion
increased
tremor
severity
significantly
.

A
good
agreement
was
found
between
two
independent
observers
(
interclass
correlation
coefficient
0.72
)
.

DISCUSSION
:

Quantifying
tremor
by
using
an
inexpensive
laser
pointer
is
,
with
the
exception
of
children
(
12
years
)
a
sensitive
and
reproducible
method
.

Increased
frequency
of
venous
thromboembolism
with
the
combination
of
docetaxel
and
thalidomide
in
patients
with
metastatic
androgen
-
independent
prostate
cancer
.

STUDY
OBJECTIVE
:

To
evaluate
the
frequency
of
venous
thromboembolism

(
VTE
)
in
patients
with
advanced
androgen
-
independent
prostate
cancer
who
were
treated
with
docetaxel
alone
or
in
combination
with
thalidomide
.

DESIGN
:

Retrospective
analysis
of
a
randomized
phase
II
trial
.

SETTING
:

National
Institutes
of
Health
clinical
research
center
.

PATIENTS
:

Seventy
men
,
aged
50
-
80
years
,
with
advanced
androgen
-
independent
prostate
cancer
.

INTERVENTION
:

Each
patient
received
either
intravenous
docetaxel

30
mg
/
m2/week
for
3
consecutive
weeks
,
followed
by
1
week
off
,
or
the
combination
of
continuous
oral
thalidomide
200
mg
every
evening
plus
the
same
docetaxel
regimen
.

This
4-week
cycle
was
repeated
until
there
was
evidence
of
excessive
toxicity
or
disease
progression
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:

None
of
23
patients
who
received
docetaxel
alone
developed
VTE
,
whereas
9
of
47
patients
(
19
%
)
who
received
docetaxel
plus
thalidomide
developed

VTE
(
p=0.025
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
addition
of
thalidomide
to
docetaxel
in
the
treatment
of
prostate
cancer
significantly
increases
the
frequency
of
VTE
.

Clinicians
should
be
aware
of
this
potential
complication
when
adding
thalidomide
to
chemotherapeutic
regimens
.

Sublingual
absorption
of
the
quaternary
ammonium
antiarrhythmic
agent
,
UM-272
.

UM-272
(
N
,
N
-
dimethylpropranolol
)
,
a
quaternary
antiarrhythmic
agent
,
was
administered
sublingually
to
dogs
with
ouabain

-induced
ventricular
tachycardias
.

Both
anti
-
arrhythmic
efficacy
and
bioavailability
were
compared
to
oral
drug
.

Sublingual
UM-272
converted

ventricular
tachycardia
to
sinus
rhythm
in
all
5
dogs
.

The
area
under
the
plasma
concentration
time
curve
at
90
min
was
4
-
12
times
greater
than
for
oral
drug
,
suggesting
the
existence
of
an
absorption
-
limiting
process
in
the
intestine
,
and
providing
an
alternate
form
of
administration
for
quaternary
drugs
.

Severe
thrombocytopenia
and
haemolytic
anaemia
associated
with
ciprofloxacin
:
a
case
report
with
fatal
outcome
.

Haematological
adverse
reactions
associated
with
fatal
outcome
are
rare
during
treatment
with
ciprofloxacin
.

A
30-year
old
Caucasian
man
reported
with
abdominal
pain
and
jaundice
after
3-day
administration
of
oral
ciprofloxacin
for
a
suspect
of
urinary
tract
infection
.

Clinical
evaluations
suggested
an
initial
diagnosis
of
severe
thrombocytopenia
and
haemolysis
.

The
patient
progressively
developed

petechiae
and
purpura
on
thorax
and
lower
limbs
.

Despite
pharmacological
and
supportive
interventions
,
laboratory
parameters
worsened
and
the
patient
died
17
hours
after
admission
.

An
accurate
autopsy
revealed
most
organs
with
diffuse
petechial
haemorrhages
.

No
signs
of
bone
marrow
depression
were
found
.

No
thrombi
or
signs
of
microangiopathies
were
observed
in
arterial
vessels
.

Blood
and
urine
cultures
did
not
show
any
bacterial
growth
.

This
case
report
shows
that
ciprofloxacin
may
precipitate
life
-
threatening
thrombocytopenia
and
haemolytic
anaemia
,
even
in
the
early
phases
of
treatment
and
without
apparent
previous
exposures
.

Simvastatin
-induced
bilateral
leg
compartment
syndrome
and
myonecrosis
associated
with
hypothyroidism
.

A
54-year
-
old
hypothyroid
male
taking

thyroxine
and
simvastatin
presented
with
bilateral
leg
compartment
syndrome
and
myonecrosis
.

Urgent
fasciotomies
were
performed
and
the
patient
made
an
uneventful
recovery
with
the
withdrawal
of
simvastatin
.

It
is
likely
that
this
complication
will
be
seen
more
often
with
the
increased
worldwide
use
of
this
drug
and
its
approval
for
all
arteriopathic
patients
.

Bile
duct
hamartoma
occurring
in
association
with
long
-
term
treatment
with
danazol
.

We
report
a
case
of
bile
duct
hamartoma
which
developed
in
a
patient
who
had
been
on
long
-
term
danazol
treatment
.

Such
patients
should
be
under
close
follow
-
up
,
preferably
with
periodic
ultrasound
examination
of
the
liver
.

If
the
patient
develops
a
liver
mass
,
because
of
non
-
specific
clinical
features
and
imaging
appearances
,
biopsy
may
be
the
only
way
to
achieve
a
definitive
diagnosis
.

Granulomatous
hepatitis
due
to
combination
of
amoxicillin
and
clavulanic
acid
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
patient
with
amoxicillin
-
clavulanic
acid
-induced

hepatitis
with
histologic
multiple
granulomas
.

This
type
of
lesion
broadens
the
spectrum
of
liver
injury
due
to
this
drug
combination
,
mainly
represented
by
a
benign
cholestatic
syndrome
.

The
association
of
granulomas
and
eosinophilia
favor
an
immunoallergic
mechanism
.

As
penicillin
derivatives
and
amoxicillin
alone
are
known
to
induce
such
types
of
lesions
,
the
amoxicillin
component
,
with
or
without
a
potentiating
effect
of
clavulanic
acid
,
might
have
a
major
role
.

Intracranial
aneurysms
and
cocaine
abuse
:
analysis
of
prognostic
indicators
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
outcome
of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
associated
with
cocaine
abuse
is
reportedly
poor
.

However
,
no
study
in
the
literature
has
reported
the
use
of
a
statistical
model
to
analyze
the
variables
that
influence
outcome
.

METHODS
:

A
review
of
admissions
during
a
6-year
period
revealed
14
patients
with
cocaine

-related

aneurysms
.

This
group
was
compared
with
a
control
group
of
135
patients
with
ruptured
aneurysms
and
no
history
of
cocaine
abuse
.

Age
at
presentation
,
time
of
ictus
after
intoxication
,
Hunt
and
Hess
grade
of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
,
size
of
the
aneurysm
,
location
of
the
aneurysm
,
and
the
Glasgow
Outcome
Scale
score
were
assessed
and
compared
.

RESULTS
:

The
patients
in
the
study
group
were
significantly
younger
than
the
patients
in
the
control
group
(
P
0.002
)
.

In
patients
in
the
study
group
,
all
aneurysms
were
located
in
the
anterior
circulation
.

The
majority
of
these
aneurysms
were
smaller
than
those
of
the
control
group
(
8
+
/-

6.08
mm
versus
11
+
/-

5.4
mm
;
P
=
0.05
)
.

The
differences
in
mortality
and
morbidity
between
the
two
groups
were
not
significant
.

Hunt
and
Hess
grade
(
P
0.005
)
and
age
(
P
0.007
)
were
significant
predictors
of
outcome
for
the
patients
with
cocaine

-related

aneurysms
.

CONCLUSION
:

Cocaine
use
predisposed

aneurysmal
rupture
at
a
significantly
earlier
age
and
in
much
smaller
aneurysms
.

Contrary
to
the
published
literature
,
this
group
did
reasonably
well
with
aggressive
management
.

Anti-
epileptic
drugs
-
induced
de
novo
absence
seizures
.

The
authors
present
three
patients
with
de
novo
absence
epilepsy
after
administration
of
carbamazepine
and
vigabatrin
.

Despite
the
underlying
diseases
,
the
prognosis
for
drug
-
induced
de
novo
absence
seizure
is
good
because
it
subsides
rapidly
after
discontinuing
the
use
of
the
offending
drugs
.

The
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
-transmitted
thalamocortical
circuitry
accounts
for
a
major
part
of
the
underlying
neurophysiology
of
the
absence
epilepsy
.

Because
drug
-
induced
de
novo
absence
seizure
is
rare
,
pro
-
absence
drugs
can
only
be
considered
a
promoting
factor
.

The
underlying
epileptogenecity
of
the
patients
or
the
synergistic
effects
of
the
accompanying
drugs
is
required
to
trigger
the
de
novo
absence
seizure
.

The
possibility
of
drug
-
induced
aggravation
should
be
considered
whenever
an
unexpected
increase
in
seizure
frequency
and/or
new
seizure
types
appear
following
a
change
in
drug
treatment
.

By
understanding
the
underlying
mechanism
of
absence
epilepsy
,
we
can
avoid
the
inappropriate
use
of
anticonvulsants
in
children
with
epilepsy
and
prevent
drug
-
induced
absence
seizures
.

Procainamide
-induced
polymorphous
ventricular
tachycardia
.

Seven
cases
of
procainamide

-induced

polymorphous
ventricular
tachycardia
are
presented
.

In
four
patients
,
polymorphous
ventricular
tachycardia
appeared
after
intravenous
administration
of
200
to
400
mg
of
procainamide
for
the
treatment
of
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
.

In
the
remaining
three
patients
,
procainamide
was
administered
orally
for
treatment
of
chronic
premature
ventricular
contractions
or
atrial
flutter
.

These
patients
had
Q
-
T
prolongation
and
recurrent
syncope
due
to
polymorphous
ventricular
tachycardia
.

In
four
patients
,
the
arrhythmia
was
rapidly
diagnosed
and
treated
with
disappearance
of
further
episodes
of
the
arrhythmia
.

In
two
patients
,
the
arrhythmia
degenerated
into
irreversible
ventricular
fibrillation
and
both
patients
died
.

In
the
seventh
patient
,
a
permanent
ventricular
pacemaker
was
inserted
and
,
despite
continuation
of
procainamide
therapy
,
polymorphous
ventricular
tachycardia
did
not
reoccur
.

These
seven
cases
demonstrate
that
procainamide
can
produce
an
acquired
prolonged
Q
-
T
syndrome
with
polymorphous
ventricular
tachycardia
.

Role
of
activation
of
bradykinin
B2
receptors
in
disruption
of
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
during
acute
hypertension
.

Cellular
mechanisms
which
account
for
disruption
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
during
acute
hypertension
are
not
clear
.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
role
of
synthesis
/
release
of
bradykinin
to
activate
B2
receptors
in
disruption
of
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
during
acute
hypertension
.

Permeability
of
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
was
quantitated
by
clearance
of
fluorescent
-
labeled
dextran
before
and
during
phenylephrine
-induced
acute
hypertension
in
rats
treated
with
vehicle
and
Hoe-140
(
0.1
microM
)
.

Phenylephrine
infusion
increased
arterial
pressure
,
arteriolar
diameter
and
clearance
of
fluorescent
dextran
by
a
similar
magnitude
in
both
groups
.

These
findings
suggest
that
disruption
of
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
during
acute
hypertension
is
not
related
to
the
synthesis
/
release
of
bradykinin
to
activate
B2
receptors
.

5-azacytidine
potentiates
initiation
induced
by
carcinogens
in
rat
liver
.

To
test
the
validity
of
the
hypothesis
that
hypomethylation
of
DNA
plays
an
important
role
in
the
initiation
of
carcinogenic
process
,
5-azacytidine

(
5-AzC
)
(
10
mg
/
kg
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
DNA
methylation
,
was
given
to
rats
during
the
phase
of
repair
synthesis
induced
by
the
three
carcinogens
,
benzo[a]-pyrene
(
200
mg
/
kg
)
,
N
-
methyl
-
N
-
nitrosourea
(
60
mg
/
kg
)
and
1,2-dimethylhydrazine

(
1,2-DMH
)
(
100
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
initiated
hepatocytes
in
the
liver
were
assayed
as
the
gamma
-
glutamyltransferase
(
gamma
-
GT
)
positive
foci
formed
following
a
2-week
selection
regimen
consisting
of
dietary
0.02
%
2-acetylaminofluorene
coupled
with
a
necrogenic
dose
of
CCl4
.

The
results
obtained
indicate
that
with
all
three
carcinogens
,
administration
of
5-AzC
during
repair
synthesis
increased
the
incidence
of
initiated
hepatocytes
,
for
example
10
-
20
foci
/
cm2
in
5-AzC
and
carcinogen
-
treated
rats
compared
with
3
-
5
foci
/
cm2
in
rats
treated
with
carcinogen
only
.

Administration
of
[
3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine
during
the
repair
synthesis
induced
by
1,2-DMH
further
showed
that
0.019
mol
%
of
cytosine
residues
in
DNA
were
substituted
by
the
analogue
,
indicating
that
incorporation
of
5-AzC
occurs
during
repair
synthesis
.

In
the
absence
of
the
carcinogen
,
5-AzC
given
after
a
two
thirds
partial
hepatectomy
,
when
its
incorporation
should
be
maximum
,
failed
to
induce
any
gamma
-
GT
positive
foci
.

The
results
suggest
that
hypomethylation
of
DNA
per
se
may
not
be
sufficient
for
initiation
.

Perhaps
two
events
might
be
necessary
for
initiation
,
the
first
caused
by
the
carcinogen
and
a
second
involving
hypomethylation
of
DNA
.

Withdrawal
-
emergent
rabbit
syndrome
during
dose
reduction
of
risperidone
.

Rabbit
syndrome

(
RS
)
is
a
rare
extrapyramidal
side
effect
caused
by
prolonged
neuroleptic
medication
.

Here
we
present
a
case
of
withdrawal
-
emergent
RS
,
which
is
the
first
of
its
kind
to
be
reported
.

The
patient
developed
RS
during
dose
reduction
of
risperidone
.

The
symptom
was
treated
successfully
with
trihexyphenidyl
anticholinergic
therapy
.

The
underlying
mechanism
of
withdrawal
-
emergent
RS
in
the
present
case
may
have
been
related
to
the
pharmacological
profile
of
risperidone
,
a
serotonin
-
dopamine
antagonist
,
suggesting
the
pathophysiologic
influence
of
the
serotonin
system
in
the
development
of
RS
.

Verapamil
withdrawal
as
a
possible
cause
of
myocardial
infarction
in
a
hypertensive
woman
with
a
normal
coronary
angiogram
.

Verapamil
is
an
effective
and
relatively
-
safe
antihypertensive
drug
.

Serious
adverse
effects
are
uncommon
and
mainly
have
been
related
to
the
depression
of
cardiac
contractility
and
conduction
,
especially
when
the
drug
is
combined
with
beta
-
blocking
agents
.

We
report
a
case
in
which
myocardial
infarction
coincided
with
the
introduction
of
captopril
and
the
withdrawal
of
verapamil
in
a
previously
asymptomatic
woman
with
severe
hypertension
.

Possible
mechanisms
that
involve
a
verapamil
-related
increase
in
platelet
and/or
vascular
alpha
2-adrenoreceptor
affinity
for
catecholamines
are
discussed
.

Remission
induction
of
meningeal
leukemia
with
high
-
dose
intravenous
methotrexate
.

Twenty
children
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
who
developed
meningeal
disease
were
treated
with
a
high
-
dose
intravenous
methotrexate
regimen
that
was
designed
to
achieve
and
maintain
CSF
methotrexate
concentrations
of
10(-5
)
mol
/
L
without
the
need
for
concomitant
intrathecal
dosing
.

The
methotrexate
was
administered
as
a
loading
dose
of
6,000
mg
/
m2
for
a
period
of
one
hour
followed
by
an
infusion
of
1,200
mg
/
m2/h
for
23
hours
.

Leucovorin
rescue
was
initiated
12
hours
after
the
end
of
the
infusion
with
a
loading
dose
of
200
mg
/
m2
followed
by
12
mg
/
m2
every
three
hours
for
six
doses
and
then
every
six
hours
until
the
plasma
methotrexate
level
decreased
to
less
than
1
X
10(-7
)
mol
/
L.

The
mean
steady
-
state
plasma
and
CSF
methotrexate
concentrations
achieved
were
1.1
X
10(-3
)
mol
/
L
and
3.6
X
10(-5
)
mol
/
L
,
respectively
.

All
20
patients
responded
to
this
regimen
,
16/20
(
80
%
)
achieved
a
complete
remission
,
and
20
%
obtained
a
partial
remission
.

The
most
common
toxicities
encountered
were
transient
serum
transaminase
and
bilirubin
elevations
,
neutropenia
,
and
mucositis
.

One
patient
had
focal
seizures
and
transient
hemiparesis
but
recovered
completely
.

High
-
dose
intravenous
methotrexate
is
an
effective
treatment
for
the
induction
of
remission
after
meningeal
relapse
in
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
.

Hypersensitivity
to
carbamazepine
presenting
with
a
leukemoid
reaction
,
eosinophilia
,
erythroderma
,
and
renal
failure
.

We
report
a
patient
in
whom
hypersensitivity
to
carbamazepine
presented
with
generalized
erythroderma
,
a
severe
leukemoid
reaction
,
eosinophilia
,
hyponatremia
,
and
renal
failure
.

This
is
the
first
report
of
such
an
unusual
reaction
to
carbamazepine
.

The
interpeduncular
nucleus
regulates
nicotine
's
effects
on
free
-
field
activity
.

Partial
lesions
were
made
with
kainic
acid
in
the
interpeduncular
nucleus
of
the
ventral
midbrain
of
the
rat
.

Compared
with
sham
-
operated
controls
,
lesions
significantly
(
p
0.25
)
blunted
the
early
(
60
min
)
free
-
field
locomotor
hypoactivity
caused
by
nicotine

(
0.5
mg
kg(-1
)
,
i.m
.
)

,
enhanced
the
later
(
60
-
120
min
)

nicotine
-induced
hyperactivity
,
and
raised
spontaneous
nocturnal
activity
.

Lesions
reduced
the
extent
of
immunohistological
staining
for
choline
acetyltransferase
in
the
interpeduncular
nucleus
(
p
0.025
)
,
but
not
for
tyrosine
hydroxylase
in
the
surrounding
catecholaminergic
A10
region
.

We
conclude
that
the
interpeduncular
nucleus
mediates
nicotinic
depression
of
locomotor
activity
and
dampens
nicotinic
arousal
mechanisms
located
elsewhere
in
the
brain
.

Assessment
of
a
new
non
-
invasive
index
of
cardiac
performance
for
detection
of
dobutamine
-induced
myocardial
ischemia
.

BACKGROUND

:
Electrocardiography
has
a
very
low
sensitivity
in
detecting
dobutamine
-induced
myocardial
ischemia
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
assess
the
added
diagnostic
value
of
a
new
cardiac
performance
index
(
dP
/
dtejc
)
measurement
,
based
on
brachial
artery
flow
changes
,
as
compared
to
standard
12-lead
ECG
,
for
detecting
dobutamine
-induced
myocardial
ischemia
,
using
Tc99m
-
Sestamibi
single
-
photon
emission
computed
tomography
as
the
gold
standard
of
comparison
to
assess
the
presence
or
absence
of
ischemia
.

METHODS
:

The
study
group
comprised
40
patients
undergoing
Sestamibi
-SPECT/
dobutamine
stress
test
.

Simultaneous
measurements
of
ECG
and
brachial
artery
dP
/
dtejc
were
performed
at
each
dobutamine
level
.

In
19
of
the
40
patients
perfusion
defects
compatible
with
ischemia
were
detected
on
SPECT
.

The
increase
in
dP
/
dtejc
during
infusion
of
dobutamine
in
this
group
was
severely
impaired
as
compared
to
the
non
-
ischemic
group
.

dP
/
dtejc
outcome
was
combined
with
the
ECG
results
,
giving
an
ECG
-
enhanced
value
,
and
compared
to
ECG
alone
.

RESULTS
:

The
sensitivity
improved
dramatically
from
16
%
to
79
%
,
positive
predictive
value
increased
from
60
%
to
68
%
and
negative
predictive
value
from
54
%
to
78
%
,
and
specificity
decreased
from
90
%
to
67
%
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

If
ECG
alone
is
used
for
specificity
,
the
combination
with
dP
/
dtejc
improved
the
sensitivity
of
the
test
and
could
be
a
cost
-
savings
alternative
to
cardiac
imaging
or
perfusion
studies
to
detect
myocardial
ischemia
,
especially
in
patients
unable
to
exercise
.

Acute
liver
failure
in
two
patients
with
regular
alcohol
consumption
ingesting
paracetamol
at
therapeutic
dosage
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
possible
role
of
alcohol
in
the
development
of
hepatotoxicity
associated
with
therapeutic
doses
of
paracetamol

(
acetaminophen
)
is
currently
debated
.

CASE
REPORT
:

We
describe
2
patients
who
were
regular
consumers
of
alcohol
and
who
developed
liver
failure
within
3
-
5
days
after
hospitalization
and
stopping
alcohol
consumption
while
being
treated
with
4
g
paracetamol
/day
.

A
paracetamol
serum
level
obtained
in
one
of
these
patients
was
not
in
the
toxic
range
.

Possible
risk
factors
for
the
development
of
hepatotoxicity
in
patients
treated
with
therapeutic
doses
of
paracetamol
are
discussed
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
patients
with
risk
factors
,
e.g.
regular
consumption
of
alcohol
,
liver
failure
is
possible
when
therapeutic
doses
are
ingested
.

We
propose
that
the
paracetamol
dose
should
not
exceed
2
g
/
day
in
such
patients
and
that
their
liver
function
should
be
monitored
closely
while
being
treated
with
paracetamol
.

Cocaine
related
chest
pain
:
are
we
seeing
the
tip
of
an
iceberg
?

The
recreational
use
of
cocaine
is
on
the
increase
.

The
emergency
nurse
ought
to
be
familiar
with
some
of
the
cardiovascular
consequences
of
cocaine
use
.

In
particular
,
the
tendency
of
cocaine
to
produce
chest
pain
ought
to
be
in
the
mind
of
the
emergency
nurse
when
faced
with
a
young
victim
of
chest
pain
who
is
otherwise
at
low
risk
.

The
mechanism
of
chest
pain
related
to
cocaine
use
is
discussed
and
treatment
dilemmas
are
discussed
.

Finally
,
moral
issues
relating
to
the
testing
of
potential
cocaine
users
will
be
addressed
.

Severe
rhabdomyolysis
and
acute
renal
failure
secondary
to
concomitant
use
of
simvastatin
,
amiodarone
,
and
atazanavir
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
a
severe
interaction
between
simvastatin
,
amiodarone
,
and
atazanavir
resulting
in
rhabdomyolysis
and
acute
renal
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:

A
72-year
-
old
white
man
with
underlying
human
immunodeficiency
virus
,
atrial
fibrillation
,
coronary
artery
disease
,
and
hyperlipidemia
presented
with
generalized
pain
,
fatigue
,
and
dark
orange
urine
for
3
days
.

The
patient
was
taking
80
mg
simvastatin
at
bedtime
(
initiated
27
days
earlier
)
;
amiodarone
at
a
dose
of
400
mg
daily
for
7
days
,
then
200
mg
daily
(
initiated
19
days
earlier
)
;
and
400
mg
atazanavir
daily
(
initiated
at
least
2
years
previously
)
.

Laboratory
evaluation
revealed
66,680
U
/
L
creatine
kinase
,
93
mg
/
dL
blood
urea
nitrogen
,
4.6
mg
/
dL
creatinine
,
1579
U
/
L
aspartate
aminotransferase
,
and
738
U
/
L
alanine
aminotransferase
.

Simvastatin
,
amiodarone
,
and
the
patient
's
human
immunodeficiency
virus
medications
were
all
temporarily
discontinued
and
the
patient
was
given
forced
alkaline
diuresis
and
started
on
dialysis
.

Nine
days
later
the
patient
's
creatine
kinase
had
dropped
to
1695
U
/
L
and
creatinine
was

3.3
mg
/
dL.

The
patient
was
discharged
and
continued
outpatient
dialysis
for
1
month
until
his
renal
function
recovered
.

DISCUSSION
:

The
risk
of
rhabdomyolysis
is
increased
in
the
presence
of
concomitant
drugs
that
inhibit
simvastatin
metabolism
.

Simvastatin
is
metabolized
by
CYP3A4
.

Amiodarone
and
atazanavir
are
recognized
CYP3A4
inhibitors
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Pharmacokinetic
differences
in
statins
are
an
important
consideration
for
assessing
the
risk
of
potential
drug
interactions
.

In
patients
requiring
the
concurrent
use
of
statins
and
CYP3A4
inhibitors
,
pravastatin
,
fluvastatin
,
and
rosuvastatin
carry
the
lowest
risk
of
drug
interactions
;
atorvastatin
carries
moderate
risk
,
whereas
simvastatin
and
lovastatin
have
the
highest
risk
and
should
be
avoided
in
patients
taking
concomitant
CYP3A4
inhibitors
.

.

PURPOSE
:
To
evaluate
the
response
rate
and
toxic
effects
of
vinorelbine

(
VNB
)
administered
as
a
single
agent
in
metastatic
squamous
cell
esophageal
carcinoma
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
Forty
-
six
eligible
patients
with
measurable
lesions
were
included
and
were
stratified
according
to
previous
chemotherapy
.

Thirty
patients
without
prior
chemotherapy
and
16
pretreated
with
cisplatin

-based
chemotherapy
were
assessable
for
toxicity
and
response
.

VNB
was
administered
weekly
as
a
25-mg
/
m2
short
intravenous
(
i.v
.
)

infusion
.

RESULTS
:

Six
of
30
patients
(
20
%
)
without
prior
chemotherapy
achieved
a
partial
response
(
PR
)
(
95
%
confidence
interval
[
CI
]
,
8
%
to
39
%
)
.

The
median
duration
of
response
was
21
weeks
(
range
,
17
to
28
)
.

One
of
16
patients
(
6
%
)
with
prior
chemotherapy
had
a
complete
response
(
CR
)
of
31
weeks
'
duration
(
95
%
CI
,
0
%
to
30
%
)
.

The
overall
response
rate
(
World
Health
Organization
[
WHO
]
criteria
)
was
15
%
(
CR
,
2
%
;
PR
13
%
;
95
%
CI
,
6
%
to
29
%
)
.

The
median
dose
-
intensity
(
DI
)
was
20
mg
/
m2/wk
.

VNB
was
well
tolerated
and
zero
instances
of
WHO
grade
4
nonhematologic
toxicity
occurred
.

At
least
one
episode
of
grade
3
or
4
granulocytopenia
was
seen
in
59
%
of
patients
.

A
grade
2
or
3
infection
occurred
in
16
%
of
patients
,
but
no
toxic
deaths
occurred
.

Other
side
effects
were
rare
,
and
peripheral
neurotoxicity
has
been
minor
(
26
%
grade
1
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

These
data
indicate
that
VNB
is
an
active
agent
in
metastatic
esophageal
squamous
cell
carcinoma
.

Given
its
excellent
tolerance
profile
and
low
toxicity
,
further
evaluation
of
VNB
in
combination
therapy
is
warranted
.

Evaluation
of
adverse
reactions
of
aponidine
hydrochloride
ophthalmic
solution
.

We
prospectively
evaluated
the
adverse
reactions
of
apraclonidine
in
20
normal
volunteers
by
instilling
a
single
drop
of
1
%
apraclonidine
in
their
right
eyes
.

Examinations
,
including
blood
pressure
,
pulse
rate
,
conjunctiva
and
cornea
,
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
,
pupil
diameter
,
basal
tear
secretion
and
margin
reflex
distance
of
both
upper
and
lower
eyelids
,
were
performed
prior
to
entry
and
at
1
,
3
,
5
and
7
hours
after
instillation
.

The
ocular
hypotensive
effects
were
statistically
significant
for
apraclonidine

-treated
eyes
throughout
the
study
and
also
statistically
significant
for
contralateral
eyes
from
three
hours
after
topical
administration
of
1
%
apraclonidine
.

Decreases
in
systolic
blood
pressure
were
statistically
,
but
not
clinically
,
significant
.

No
significant
changes
in
diastolic
blood
pressure
,
pulse
rate
and
basal
tear
secretion
were
noted
.

Conjunctival
blanching
and
mydriasis
were
commonly
found
.

Upper
lid
retraction
was
frequently
noted
.

While
the
elevations
of
the
upper
lid
margin
in
most
subjects
were
not
more
than
2
mm
and
did
not
cause
noticeable
change
in
appearance
,
one
subject
suffered
from
mechanical
entropion
and
marked
corneal
abrasion

3
hours
after
instillation
of
the
medication
.

This
may
well
be
a
particularly
notable
finding
in
Asian
people

Carmofur
-induced
organic
mental
disorders
.

Organic
mental
disorder
was
observed
in
a
29-year
-
old
female
in
the
prognostic
period
after
the
onset
of
carmofur

-induced

leukoencephalopathy
.

Symptoms
such
as
euphoria
,
emotional
lability
and
puerile
attitude
noted
in
the
patient
were
diagnosed
as
organic
personality
syndrome
according
to
the
criteria
defined
in
the
DSM
-
III
-
R.

It
is
referred
to
as
a
frontal
lobe
syndrome
.

Brain
CT
revealed
a
periventricular
low
density
area
in
the
frontal
white
matter
and
moderate
dilatation
of
the
lateral
ventricles
especially
at
the
bilateral
anterior
horns
.

Consequently
,
carmofur
-induced

leukoencephalopathy
may
uncommonly
result
in
organic
personality
syndrome
in
the
residual
state
.

It
may
be
attributed
to
the
structural
damage
to
the
frontal
lobe
.

International
mexiletine

Report
on
arrhythmia
and
other
findings
.

Impact
Research
Group
.

The
antiarrhythmic
effects
of
the
sustained
release
form
of
mexiletine

(
Mexitil
-
Perlongets
)
were
evaluated
in
a
double
-
blind
placebo
trial
in
630
patients
with
recent
documented
myocardial
infarction
.

The
primary
response
variable
was
based
on
central
reading
of
24
hour
ambulatory
electrocardiographic
recordings
and
was
defined
as
the
occurrence
of
30
or
more
single
premature
ventricular
complexes
in
any
two
consecutive
30
minute
blocks
or
one
or
more
runs
of
two
or
more
premature
ventricular
complexes
in
the
entire
24
hour
electrocardiographic
recording
.

Large
differences
,
regarded
as
statistically
significant
,
between
the
mexiletine
and
placebo
groups
were
noted
in
that
end
point
at
months
1
and
4
,
but
only
trends
were
observed
at
month
12
.

These
differences
were
observed
even
though
the
serum
mexiletine
levels
obtained
in
this
study
were
generally
lower
than
those
observed
in
studies
that
have
used
the
regular
form
of
the
drug
.

There
were
more
deaths
in
the
mexiletine
group
(
7.6
%
)
than
in
the
placebo
group
(
4.8
%
)
;
the
difference
was
not
statistically
significant
.

The
incidence
of
coronary
events
was
similar
in
both
groups
.

Previously
recognized
side
effects
,
particularly
tremor
and
gastrointestinal
problems
,
were
more
frequent
in
the
mexiletine
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
.

Regional
localization
of
the
antagonism
of
amphetamine

-induced

hyperactivity
by
intracerebral
calcitonin
injections
.

Calcitonin
receptors
are
found
in
the
brain
,
and
intracerebral
infusions
of
calcitonin
can
produce
behavioral
effects
.

Among
these
behavioral
effects
are
decreases
in
food
intake
and
decreases
in
amphetamine
-induced
locomotor
activity
.

In
previous
experiments
we
found
that
decreases
in
food
intake
were
induced
by
local
administration
of
calcitonin
into
several
hypothalamic
sites
and
into
the
nucleus
accumbens
.

In
the
present
experiment
calcitonin
decreased
locomotor
activity
when
locally
injected
into
the
same
sites
where
it
decreases
food
intake
.

The
areas
where
calcitonin
is
most
effective
in
decreasing
locomotor
activity
are
located
in
the
hypothalamus
and
nucleus
accumbens
,
suggesting
that
these
areas
are
the
major
sites
of
action
of
calcitonin
in
inhibiting
amphetamine
-induced
locomotor
activity
.

Fatal
intracranial
bleeding
associated
with
prehospital
use
of
epinephrine
.

We
present
a
case
of
paramedic
misjudgment
in
the
execution
of
a
protocol
for
the
treatment
of
allergic
reaction
in
a
case
of
pulmonary
edema
with
wheezing
.

The
sudden
onset
of
respiratory
distress
,
rash
,
and
a
history
of
a
new
medicine
led
the
two
paramedics
on
the
scene
to
administer
subcutaneous
epinephrine
.

Subsequently
,
acute
cardiac
arrest
and
fatal
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
occurred
.

Epinephrine
has
a
proven
role
in
cardiac
arrest
in
prehospital
care
;
however
,
use
by
paramedics
in
patients
with
suspected
allergic
reaction
and
severe
hypertension
should
be
viewed
with
caution
.

A
case
of
massive
rhabdomyolysis
following
molindone
administration
.

Rhabdomyolysis
is
a
potentially
lethal
syndrome
that
psychiatric
patients
seem
predisposed
to
develop
.

The
clinical
signs
and
symptoms
,
typical
laboratory
features
,
and
complications
of
rhabdomyolysis
are
presented
.

The
case
of
a
schizophrenic
patient
is
reported
to
illustrate
massive
rhabdomyolysis
and
subsequent
acute
renal
failure
following
molindone
administration
.

Physicians
who
prescribe
molindone
should
be
aware
of
this
reaction
.

Cardiovascular
alterations
in
rat
fetuses
exposed
to
calcium
channel
blockers
.

Preclinical
toxicologic
investigation
suggested
that
a
new
calcium
channel
blocker
,
Ro
40
-
5967
,
induced
cardiovascular
alterations
in
rat
fetuses
exposed
to
this
agent
during
organogenesis
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
hypothesis
that
calcium
channel
blockers
in
general
induce
cardiovascular
malformations
indicating
a
pharmacologic
class
effect
.

We
studied
three
calcium
channel
blockers
of
different
structure
,
nifedipine
,
diltiazem
,
and
verapamil
,
along
with
the
new
agent
.

Pregnant
rats
were
administered
one
of
these
calcium
channel
blockers
during
the
period
of
cardiac
morphogenesis
and
the
offspring
examined
on
day
20
of
gestation
for
cardiovascular
malformations
.

A
low
incidence
of
cardiovascular
malformations
was
observed
after
exposure
to
each
of
the
four
calcium
channel
blockers
,
but
this
incidence
was
statistically
significant
only
for
verapamil
and
nifedipine
.

All
four
agents
were
associated
with
aortic
arch
branching
variants
,
although
significantly
increased
only
for
Ro
40
-
5967
and
verapamil
.

Differential
impact
of
immune
escape
mutations
G145R
and
P120
T
on
the
replication
of
lamivudine
-resistant

hepatitis
B
virus
e
antigen
-positive
and
-negative
strains
.

Immune
escape
variants
of
the
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
represent
an
emerging
clinical
challenge
,
because
they
can
be
associated
with
vaccine
escape
,
HBV
reactivation
,
and
failure
of
diagnostic
tests
.

Recent
data
suggest
a
preferential
selection
of
immune
escape
mutants
in
distinct
peripheral
blood
leukocyte
compartments
of
infected
individuals
.

We
therefore
systematically
analyzed
the
functional
impact
of
the
most
prevalent
immune
escape
variants
,
the
sG145R
and
sP120
T
mutants
,
on
the
viral
replication
efficacy
and
antiviral
drug
susceptibility
of
common
treatment
-
associated
mutants
with
resistance
to
lamivudine

(
LAM
)
and/or
HBeAg
negativity
.

Replication
-
competent
HBV
strains
with
sG145R
or
sP120
T
and

LAM
resistance
(
rtM204I
or
rtL180M
/
rtM204V
)
were
generated
on
an
HBeAg
-positive
and
an
HBeAg
-negative
background
with
precore
(
PC
)
and
basal
core
promoter
(
BCP
)
mutants
.

The
sG145R
mutation
strongly
reduced
HBsAg
levels
and
was
able
to
fully
restore
the
impaired
replication
of
LAM
-resistant
HBV
mutants
to
the
levels
of
wild
-
type
HBV
,
and
PC
or
BCP
mutations
further
enhanced
viral
replication
.

Although
the
sP120
T
substitution
also
impaired
HBsAg
secretion
,
it
did
not
enhance
the
replication
of
LAM

-resistant
clones
.

However
,
the
concomitant
occurrence
of
HBeAg
negativity
(
PC
/
BCP
)
,
sP120
T
,
and
LAM
resistance
resulted
in
the
restoration
of
replication
to
levels
of
wild
-
type
HBV
.

In
all
clones
with
combined
immune
escape
and
LAM
resistance
mutations
,
the
nucleotide
analogues
adefovir
and
tenofovir
remained
effective
in
suppressing
viral
replication
in
vitro
.

These
findings
reveal
the
differential
impact
of
immune
escape
variants
on
the
replication
and
drug
susceptibility
of
complex
HBV
mutants
,
supporting
the
need
of
close
surveillance
and
treatment
adjustment
in
response
to
the
selection
of
distinct
mutational
patterns
.

The
effects
of
sevoflurane
on
lidocaine
-induced
convulsions
.

The
influence
of
sevoflurane
on

lidocaine
-induced

convulsions
was
studied
in
cats
.

The
convulsive
threshold
(

)
was
41.4
+
/-

6.5
mg
.

l(-1
)
with

infusion
(

)
,
increasing
significantly
to
66.6
+

/-
10.9
mg
.

l(-1
)
when
the
end
-
tidal
concentration
of
sevoflurane
was
0.8
%
.

However
,
the
threshold
(
61.6
+
/-

8.7
mg
.

l(-1
)
)

during
1.6
%

sevoflurane
was
not
significant
from
that
during
0.8
%
sevoflurane
,
indicating
a
celling
effect
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
convulsive
threshold
between
sevoflurane
and
enflurane
.

The
rise
in
blood
pressure
became
less
marked
when
higher
concentrations
of
sevoflurane
or
enflurane
were
administered
and
the
blood
pressure
at
convulsions
decreased
significantly
in
1.6
%
sevoflurane
,
and
in
0.8
%
and
1.6
%
enflurane
.

However
,
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
lidocaine
concentrations
measured
when
the
systolic
blood
pressure
became
70
mmHg
.

Apamin
,
a
selective
blocker
of
calcium

-dependent

potassium
channels
,
was
administered
intracerebroventricularly
in
rats
anesthetized
with
0.8
%
sevoflurane
to
investigate
the
mechanism
of
the
anticonvulsive
effects
.

Apamin
(
10
ng
)
had
a
tendency
to
decrease
the
convulsive
threshold
(
21.6
+
/-
2.2
to
19.9
+
/-

2.5
mg
.

l(-1
)
)
but

this
was
not
statistically
significant
.

It
is
suggested
that
sevoflurane
reduces
the
convulsive
effect
of
lidocaine
toxicity
but
carries
some
risk
due
to
circulatory
depression
.

Anti

.

Dexamethasone

(
Dex
)
-induced

hypertension
is
characterized
by
endothelial
dysfunction
associated
with
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
deficiency
and
increased
superoxide

production
.

Atorvastatin

(
Ato
)
possesses
pleiotropic
properties
that
have
been
reported
to
improve
endothelial
function
through
increased
availability
of
NO

studies
demonstrated
that
the
rats
developed
an
infarct

18
h
after
isoproterenol
administration
.

The
rat
biodistribution
studies
showed
a
rapid
blood
clearance
via
the
kidneys
.

Thirty
minutes
after
99mTc
-
glucarate
administration
the
standardised
heart
uptake
value
S(h)UV
was
4.7
in
infarcted
rat
heart
which
is
six
times
more
than
in
normal
rats
.

ROIs
drawn
over
the
gamma
camera
images
showed
a
ratio
of
4.4
.

The
high
image
quality
suggests
that
high
contrast
images
can
be
obtained
in
humans
and
the
96
h
stability
makes
it
an
ideal
agent
to
detect
,
in
patients
,
early
cardiac
infarction
.

A
randomized
,
placebo
-
controlled
dose
-
comparison
trial
of
haloperidol
for
psychosis
and
disruptive
behaviors
in
Alzheimer
's
disease
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
compare
the
efficacy
and
side
effects
of
two
doses
of
haloperidol
and
placebo
in
the
treatment
of
psychosis
and
disruptive
behaviors
in
patients
with
Alzheimer
's
disease
.

METHOD
:

In
a
6-week
random
-
assignment
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
(
phase
A
)
,
haloperidol
,
2
-
3
mg
/
day
(
standard
dose
)
,
and
haloperidol
,
0.50
-
0.75
mg
/
day
(
low
dose
)
,
were
compared
in
71
outpatients
with
Alzheimer
's
disease
.

For
the
subsequent
6-week
double
-
blind
crossover
phase
(
phase
B
)
,
patients
taking
standard-
or
low
-
dose
haloperidol
were
switched
to
placebo
,
and
patients
taking
placebo
were
randomly
assigned
to
standard-
or
low
-
dose
haloperidol
.

RESULTS
:

For
the
60
patients
who
completed
phase
A
,
standard
-
dose
haloperidol
was
efficacious
and
superior
to
both
low
-
dose
haloperidol
and
placebo
for
scores
on
the
Brief
Psychiatric
Rating
Scale
psychosis
factor
and
on
psychomotor
agitation
.

Response
rates
according
to
three
sets
of
criteria
were
greater
with
the
standard
dose
(
55%-60
%
)
than
the
low
dose
(
25%-35
%
)
and
placebo
(
25%-30
%
)
.

The
advantage
of
standard
dose
over
low
dose
was
replicated
in
phase
B.
In
phase
A
,
extrapyramidal
signs
tended
to
be
greater
with
the
standard
dose
than
in
the
other
two
conditions
,
primarily
because
of
a
subgroup
(
20
%
)
who
developed
moderate
to
severe
signs
.

Low
-
dose

haloperidol
did
not
differ
from
placebo
on
any
measure
of
efficacy
or
side
effects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
results
indicated
a
favorable
therapeutic
profile
for
haloperidol
in
doses
of
2
-
3
mg
/
day
,
although
a
subgroup
developed
moderate
to
severe
extrapyramidal
signs
.

A
starting
dose
of
1
mg
/
day
with
gradual
,
upward
dose
titration
is
recommended
.

The
narrow
therapeutic
window
observed
with
haloperidol
may
also
apply
to
other
neuroleptics
used
in
Alzheimer
's
disease
patients
with
psychosis
and
disruptive
behaviors
.

Individual
differences
in
renal
ACE
activity
in
healthy
rats
predict
susceptibility
to
adriamycin

-induced

renal
damage
.

BACKGROUND
:

In
man
,
differences
in
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
levels
,
related
to
ACE
(
I
/
D
)
genotype
,
are
associated
with
renal
prognosis
.

This
raises
the
hypothesis
that
individual
differences
in
renal
ACE
activity
are
involved
in
renal
susceptibility
to
inflicted
damage
.

Therefore
,
we
studied
the
predictive
effect
of
renal
ACE
activity
for
the
severity
of
renal
damage
induced
by
a
single
injection
of
adriamycin
in
rats
.

METHODS
:
Renal
ACE
activity
(
Hip
-
His
-
Leu
cleavage
by
cortical
homogenates
)
was
determined
by
renal
biopsy
in
27
adult
male
Wistar
rats
.

After
1
week
of
recovery
,
proteinuria
was
induced
by
adriamycin

[
1.5
mg
/
kg
intravenously
(
i.v
.
)

n
=
18
;
controls
,
saline
i.v
.

n
=
9
]
.

Proteinuria
was
measured
every
2
weeks
.

After
12
weeks
,
rats
were
sacrificed
and
their
kidneys
harvested
.

RESULTS
:

As
anticipated
,
adriamycin
elicited
nephrotic
range
proteinuria
,
renal
interstitial
damage
and
mild
focal
glomerulosclerosis
.

Baseline
renal
ACE
positively
correlated
with
the
relative
rise
in
proteinuria
after
adriamycin

(
r
=
0.62
,
P<0.01
)
,
renal
interstitial

r
=
0.49
,
P<0.05

(
r
=
0.56
,
P<0.05
)
,
interstitial

(
r
=
0.53
,
P<0.05
)
,
glomerular

(
r
=
0.74
,
P<0.01
)
and
glomerular
desmin
(
r
=
0.48
,
P<0.05
)
.

Baseline
renal
ACE
did
not
correlate
with
focal
glomerulosclerosis

(
r
=
0.22
,
NS
)
.

In
controls
,
no
predictive
values
for
renal
parameters
were
observed
.

CONCLUSION
:

Individual
differences
in
renal
ACE
activity
predict
the
severity
of
adriamycin
-induced

renal
damage
in
this
outbred
rat
strain
.

This
supports
the
assumption
that
differences
in
renal
ACE
activity
predispose
to
a
less
favourable
course
of
renal
damage
.

Clinical
nephrotoxicity
of

tobramycin
and
gentamicin
.

A
prospective
study
.

Nearly
3.2
million
people
in
this
country
receive
aminoglycoside
antibiotics
annually
.

Gentamicin
sulfate
and
tobramycin
sulfate
continue
to
demonstrate
ototoxicity
and
nephrotoxicity
in
both
animal
and
clinical
studies
.

In
this
study
,
62
patients
with
confirmed
initial
normal
renal
function
and
treated
with
2
to
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
of
gentamicin
sulfate
or
tobramycin
sulfate
for
a
minimum
of
seven
days
were
followed
up
prospectively
for
the
development
of
aminoglycoside
-related
renal
failure
,
defined
as
at
least
a
one
-
third
reduction
in
renal
function
.

In
these
62
patients
,
no
other
causes
for
renal
failure
could
be
identified
.

Five
of
33
(
15
%
)
of
the
tobramycin
-treated
patients
and
16
of
29
(
55.2
%
)
of
the
gentamicin

-treated
patients
had
renal
failure
.

Thus
,
gentamicin
was
associated
with
renal
failure

more
than
three
times
as
often
as
was
tobramycin
.

Neuroprotective
action
of
MPEP
,
a
selective
mGluR5
antagonist
,
in
methamphetamine
-induced
dopaminergic
neurotoxicity
is
associated
with
a
decrease
in
dopamine
outflow
and
inhibition
of
hyperthermia
in
rats
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
role
of
metabotropic
glutamate
receptor
5
(
mGluR5
)
in
the
toxic
action
of
methamphetamine
on
dopaminergic
neurones
in
rats
.

Methamphetamine

(
10
mg
/
kg
sc
)
,
administered
five
times
,
reduced
the
levels
of
dopamine
and
its
metabolites
in
striatal
tissue
when
measured
72
h
after
the
last
injection
.

A
selective
antagonist
of
mGluR5
,
2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine

(
MPEP
;
5
mg
/
kg
ip
)
,
when
administered
five
times
immediately
before
each
methamphetamine
injection
reversed
the
above
-
mentioned
methamphetamine
effects
.

A
single
MPEP

(
5
mg
/
kg
ip
)
injection
reduced
the
basal
extracellular
dopamine
level
in
the
striatum
,
as
well
as
dopamine
release
stimulated
either
by
methamphetamine

(
10
mg
/
kg
sc
)
or
by
intrastriatally
administered
veratridine
(
100
microM
)
.

Moreover
,
it
transiently
diminished
the
methamphetamine

(
10
mg
/
kg
sc)-induced
hyperthermia
and
reduced
basal
body
temperature
.

MPEP
administered
into
the
striatum
at
high
concentrations
(
500
microM
)
increased
extracellular
dopamine
levels
,
while
lower
concentrations
(
50
-
100
microM
)
were
devoid
of
any
effect
.

The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
the
blockade
of
mGluR5
by
MPEP
may
protect
dopaminergic
neurones
against
methamphetamine

-induced

toxicity
.

Neuroprotection
rendered
by
MPEP
may
be
associated
with
the
reduction
of
the
methamphetamine
-induced
dopamine
efflux
in
the
striatum
due
to
the
blockade
of
extrastriatal
mGluR5
,
and
with
a
decrease
in
hyperthermia
.

Pharmacokinetics
of
desipramine
HCl
when
administered
with
cinacalcet
HCl
.

OBJECTIVE
:

In
vitro
work
has
demonstrated
that
cinacalcet
is
a
strong
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450

isoenzyme

(
CYP
)
2D6
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
cinacalcet
on
CYP2D6
activity
,
using
desipramine
as
a
probe
substrate
,
in
healthy
subjects
.

METHODS
:

Seventeen
subjects
who
were
genotyped
as
CYP2D6
extensive
metabolizers
were
enrolled
in
this
randomized
,
open
-
label
,
crossover
study
to
receive
a
single
oral
dose
of
desipramine

(
50
mg
)
on
two
separate
occasions
,
once
alone
and
once
after
multiple
doses
of
cinacalcet

(
90
mg
for
7
days
)
.

Blood
samples
were
obtained
predose
and
up
to
72
h
postdose
.

RESULTS
:

Fourteen
subjects
completed
both
treatment
arms
.

Relative
to
desipramine
alone
,

mean
AUC
and
C(max
)
of

desipramine
increased
3.6-
and
1.8-fold
when
coadministered
with
cinacalcet
.

The
t
(
1/2,z
)
of
desipramine
was
longer
when
desipramine
was
coadministered
with
cinacalcet

(
21.0
versus
43.3
hs
)
.

The
t
(
max
)
was
similar
between
the
regimens
.

Fewer
subjects
reported
adverse
events
following
treatment
with
desipramine
alone
than
when
receiving
desipramine
with
cinacalcet

(
33
versus
86
%
)
,
the
most
frequent
of
which
(
nausea
and
headache
)
have
been
reported
for
patients
treated
with
either
desipramine
or
cinacalcet
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
study
demonstrates
that
cinacalcet
is
a
strong
inhibitor
of
CYP2D6
.

These
data
suggest
that
during
concomitant
treatment
with
cinacalcet
,
dose
adjustment
may
be
necessary
for
drugs
that
demonstrate
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
and
are
metabolized
by
CYP2D6
.

Proteomic
analysis
of
striatal
proteins
in
the
rat
model
of
L
-
DOPA

-induced
dyskinesia
.

L
-
DOPA
-induced

dyskinesia

(
LID
)
is
among
the
motor
complications
that
arise
in
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
patients
after
a
prolonged
treatment
with
L
-
DOPA
.

To
this
day
,
transcriptome
analysis
has
been
performed
in
a
rat
model
of
LID

[
Neurobiol
.

Dis
.
,
17
(
2004
)
,
219
]
but
information
regarding
the
proteome
is
still
lacking
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
changes
occurring
at
the
protein
level
in
striatal
samples
obtained
from
the
unilaterally
6-hydroxydopamine
-lesion
rat
model
of
PD
treated
with
saline
,
L
-
DOPA
or
bromocriptine
using
two
-
dimensional
difference
gel
electrophoresis
and
mass
spectrometry
(
MS
)
.

Rats
treated
with
L
-
DOPA
were
allocated
to
two
groups
based
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
LID
.

Among
the
2000
spots
compared
for
statistical
difference
,
67
spots
were
significantly
changed
in
abundance
and
identified
using
matrix
-
assisted
laser
desorption
/
ionization
time
-
of
-
flight
MS
,
atmospheric
pressure
matrix
-
assisted
laser
desorption
/
ionization
and
HPLC
coupled
tandem
MS
(
LC
/
MS
/
MS
)
.

Out
of
these
67
proteins
,
LID
significantly
changed
the
expression
level
of
five
proteins
:
alphabeta
-
crystalin
,
gamma
-
enolase
,
guanidoacetate
methyltransferase
,
vinculin
,
and
proteasome
alpha-2
subunit
.

Complementary
techniques
such
as
western
immunoblotting
and
immunohistochemistry
were
performed
to
investigate
the
validity
of
the
data
obtained
using
the
proteomic
approach
.

In
conclusion
,
this
study
provides
new
insights
into
the
protein
changes
occurring
in
LID
.

Pseudo-
allergic
reactions
to
corticosteroids
:
diagnosis
and
alternatives
.

Two
patients
treated
with
parenteral
paramethasone
(
Triniol
)
and
dexamethasone

(
Sedionbel
)
are
described
.

A
few
minutes
after
administration
of
the
drugs
,
they
presented
urticaria

(
patients
1
and
2
)
and
conjunctivitis
(
patient
1
)
.

The
purpose
of
our
study
was
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
patients
'
reactions
,
the
immunological
mechanisms
involved
and
whether
these
patients
would
be
able
to
tolerate
any
kind
of
corticoid
.

Clinical
examinations
and
skin
,
oral
and
parenteral
challenges
with
different
corticosteroids
and
ELISA
tests
were
performed
.

In
the
two
patients
,
skin
and
ELISA
tests
with
paramethasone
were
negative
,
as
was
the
prick
test
with
each
of
its
excipients
.

A
single
-
blind
parenteral
challenge
with
Triniol
was
positive
in
both
patients
after
the
administration
of
1
ml
of
the
drug
,
and
negative
with
its
excipients
.

We
also
carried
out
oral
and
parenteral
challenges
with
other
corticosteroids
and
found
intolerance
to
some
of
them
.

These
results
suggest
that
paramethasone
caused
pseudoallergic
reactions
in
our
patients
.

Corticosteroids
different
from
paramethasone
also
produced
hypersensitivity
reactions
in
these
patients
;
however
,
a
few
of
them
were
tolerated
.

The
basic
mechanisms
of
those
reactions
are
not
yet
fully
understood
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
of
a
pseudo-
allergy
caused
by
paramethasone
.

Valproic
acid
induced
encephalopathy
--19
new
cases
in
Germany
from
1994
to
2003
-
-a
side
effect
associated
to

VPA
-therapy
not
only
in
young
children
.

Valproic
acid

(
VPA
)
is
a
broad
-
spectrum
antiepileptic
drug
and
is
usually
well
-
tolerated
.

Rare
serious
complications
may
occur
in
some
patients
,
including
haemorrhagic
pancreatitis
,
bone
marrow
suppression
,

VPA
-induced
hepatotoxicity
and
VPA
-induced

encephalopathy
.

The
typical
signs
of
VPA
-induced
encephalopathy
are
impaired
consciousness
,
sometimes
marked
EEG
background
slowing
,
increased
seizure
frequency
,
with
or
without
hyperammonemia
.

There
is
still
no
proof
of
causative
effect
of
VPA
in
patients
with
encephalopathy
,
but
only
of
an
association
with
an
assumed
causal
relation
.

We
report
19
patients
with
VPA

-associated

encephalopathy
in
Germany
from
the
years
1994
to
2003
,
none
of
whom
had
been
published
previously

Haemolytic
-
uraemic
syndrome
after
treatment
with
metronidazole
.

This
paper
describes
the
clinical
features
of
six
children
who
developed
the
haemolytic
-
uraemic
syndrome
after
treatment
with
metronidazole
.

These
children
were
older
and
were
more
likely
to
have
undergone
recent
bowel
surgery
than
are
other
children
with
this
condition
.

While
the
involvement
of
metronidazole
in
the
aetiology
of
the
haemolytic
-
uraemic
syndrome
is
not
established
firmly
,
the
action
of
this
drug
in
sensitizing
tissues
to
oxidation
injury
and
the
reported
evidence
of
oxidation
changes
in
the
haemolytic
-
uraemic
syndrome
suggest
a
possible
link
between
metronidazole
treatment
and
some
cases
of
the
haemolytic
-
uraemic
syndrome
.

Risk
factors
of
sensorineural
hearing
loss
in
preterm
infants
.

Among
547
preterm
infants
of
or
=
34
weeks
gestation
born
between
1987
and
1991
,
8
children
(
1.46
%
)
developed
severe
progressive
and
bilateral
sensorineural
hearing
loss
.

Perinatal
risk
factors
of
infants
with
hearing
loss
were
compared
with
those
of
two
control
groups
matched
for
gestation
and
birth
weight
and
for
perinatal
complications
.

Our
observations
demonstrated
an
association
of
hearing
loss
with
a
higher
incidence
of
perinatal
complications
.

Ototoxicity
appeared
closely
related
to
a
prolonged
administration
and
higher
total
dose
of
ototoxic
drugs
,
particularly
aminoglycosides
and
furosemide
.

Finally
,
we
strongly
recommend
to
prospectively
and
regularly
perform
audiologic
assessment
in
sick
preterm
children
as
hearing
loss
is
of
delayed
onset
and
in
most
cases
bilateral
and
severe
.

Pharmacokinetic

changes
in
mental
status
(
M.S.
)
were
correlated
with
serum
concentrations
and
renal
and
hepatic
function
in
36
patients
,
30
patients
had
no
M.S.
change
on
cimetidine
and
6
had
moderate
to
severe
changes
.

These
6
patients
had
both
renal
and
liver
dysfunction
(
P
less
than
0.05
)
,
as
well
as
cimetidine
trough
-
concentrations
of
more
than
1.25
microgram
/
ml
(
P
less
than
0.05
)
.

The
severity
of
M.S.
changes
increased
as
trough
-
concentrations
rose
,
5
patients
had
lumbar
puncture
.

The
cerebrospinal
fluid
:
serum
ratio
of
cimetidine

concentrations
was
0.24:1
and
indicates
that
cimetidine
passes
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
;
it
also
raises
the
possibility
that
M.S.
changes
are
due
to
blockade
of
histamine

H2-receptors
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

Patients
likely
to
have
both
raised
trough
-
concentrations
and
mental
confusion
are
those
with
both
severe
renal
and
hepatic
dysfunction
.

They
should
be
closely
observed
and
should
be
given
reduced
doses
of
cimetidine
.

Different
lobular
distributions
of
altered
hepatocyte
tight
junctions
in
rat
models
of
intrahepatic
and
extrahepatic
cholestasis
.

Hepatocyte
tight
junctions
(
TJs
)
,
the
only
intercellular
barrier
between
the
sinusoidal
and
the
canalicular
spaces
,
play
a
key
role
in
bile
formation
.

Although
hepatocyte
TJs
are
impaired
in
cholestasis
,
attempts
to
localize
the
precise
site
of
hepatocyte
TJ
damage
by
freeze
-
fracture
electron
microscopy
have
produced
limited
information
.

Recently
,
several
TJ
-
associated
proteins
like
ZO-1
and
7H6
have
been
identified
and
characterized
.

Immunolocalization
of
7H6
appears
to
closely
correlate
with
paracellular
permeability
.

We
used
rat
models
of
intrahepatic
cholestasis
by
ethinyl
estradiol

(
EE
)
treatment
and
extrahepatic
cholestasis
by
bile
duct
ligation
(
BDL
)
to
precisely
determine
the
site
of
TJ
damage
.

Alterations
in
hepatocyte
TJs
were
assessed
by
double
-
immunolabeling
for
7H6
and
ZO-1
using
a
confocal
laser
scanning
microscope
.

In
control
rats
,
immunostaining
for
7H6
and
ZO-1
colocalized
to
outline
bile
canaliculi
in
a
continuous
fashion
.

In
contrast
,
7H6
and
ZO-1
immunostaining
was
more
discontinuous
,
outlining
the
bile
canaliculi
after
BDL
.

Immunostaining
for
7H6
,
not
ZO-1
,
decreased
and
predominantly
appeared
as
discrete
signals
in
the
submembranous
cytoplasm
of
periportal
hepatocytes
after
BDL
.

After
EE
treatment
,
changes
in
immunostaining
for
7H6
and
ZO-1
were
similar
to
those
seen
in
periportal
hepatocytes
after
BDL
,
but
distributed
more
diffusely
throughout
the
lobule
.

This
study
is
the
first
to
demonstrate
that
impairment
of
hepatocyte
TJs
occurs
heterogenously
in
the
liver
lobule
after
BDL
and
suggests
that
BDL
and
EE
treatments
produce
different
lobular
distributions
of
increased
paracellular
permeability
.

Long
term
audiological
evaluation
of
beta
-
thalassemic
patients
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
identify
the
incidence
and
to
monitor
the
progression
of
hearing
loss
in
children
and
young
adults
with
beta
-
thalassemia
major
.

METHODS
:

One
hundred
and
four
(
104
)
patients
aged
6
-
35
years
(
mean
17,2
years
)
participated
in
the
study
.

All
patients
were
on
a
regular
transfusion
-
chelation
program
maintaining
a
mean
hemoglobin
level
of
9.5
gr
/
dl
.

Subjects
were
receiving
desferrioxamine

(
DFO
)
chelation
treatment
with
a
mean
daily
dose
of
50
-
60
mg
/
kg
,
5
-
6
days
a
week
during
the
first
six
years
of
the
study
,
which
was
then
reduced
to
40
-
50
mg
/
kg
for
the
following
eight
years
.

Patients
were
followed
for
8
-
14
years
.

RESULTS
:

Overall
,
21
out
of
104
patients
(
20.2
%
)
presented
with
high
frequency
sensorineural
hearing
loss

(
SNHL
)
,
either
unilateral
or
bilateral
.

No
ototoxic
factor
,
other
than
DFO
,
was
present
in
any
of
the
patients
.

Patients
with
SNHL
presented
with
relatively
lower
serum
ferritin
levels
than
those
with
normal
hearing
,
however
,
no
statistically
significant
difference
was
observed
.

Subjects
with
SNHL
were
submitted
to
DFO
reduction
or
temporary
withdrawal
.

Following
intervention
,
7
out
of
21
affected
patients
recovered
,
10
remained
stable
and
4
demonstrated
aggravation
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
findings
are
indicative
of
DFO
's
contributing
role
in
the
development
of
hearing
impairment
.

Regular
audiologic
evaluation
is
imperative
in
all
thalassemic
patients
so
that
early
changes
may
be
recognized
and
treatment
may
be
judiciously
adjusted
in
order
to
prevent
or
reverse
hearing
impairment
.

Design
and
analysis
of
the
HYPREN
-
trial
:
safety
of
enalapril
and
prazosin
in
the
initial
treatment
phase
of
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
.

Since
the
introduction
of
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
into
the
adjunctive
treatment
of
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure
,
cases
of
severe
hypotension
,
especially
on
the
first
day
of
treatment
,
have
occasionally
been
reported
.

To
assess
the
safety
of
the
ACE
inhibitor

enalapril
a
multicenter
,
randomized
,
prazosin

-controlled
trial
was
designed
that
compared
the
incidence
and
severity
of
symptomatic
hypotension
on
the
first
day
of
treatment
.

Trial
medication
was
2.5
mg
enalapril
or
0.5
prazosin
.

Subjects
were
1210
inpatients
with
New
York
Heart
Association
(
NYHA
)
functional
class
II
and
III
.

Patients
who
received
enalapril
experienced
clinically
and
statistically
significantly
less
symptomatic
hypotension
(
5.2
%
)
than
the
patients
who
received
prazosin
(
12.9
%
)
.

All
patients
recovered
.

It
was
concluded
that
treatment
with
enalapril
was
well
tolerated
and
it
is
,
therefore
,
unreasonable
to
restrict
the
initiation
of
treatment
with
enalapril
to
inpatients
.

Antagonism
between
interleukin
3
and
erythropoietin
in
mice
with

azidothymidine
-induced
anemia
and
in
bone
marrow
endothelial
cells
.

Azidothymidine
(
AZT
)
-induced

anemia
in
mice
can
be
reversed
by
the
administration
of
IGF
-
IL-3
(
fusion
protein
of
insulin
-
like
growth
factor
II
(
IGF
II
)
and
interleukin
3
)
.

Although
interleukin
3
(
IL-3
)
and
erythropoietin
(
EPO
)
are
known
to
act
synergistically
on
hematopoietic
cell
proliferation
in
vitro
,
injection
of
IGF
-
IL-3
and
EPO
in

AZT

-treated
mice
resulted
in
a
reduction
of
red
cells
and
an
increase
of
plasma
EPO
levels
as
compared
to
animals
treated
with
IGF
-
IL-3
or
EPO
alone
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
the
antagonistic
effect
of
IL-3
and
EPO
on
erythroid
cells
may
be
mediated
by
endothelial
cells
.

Bovine
liver
erythroid
cells
were
cultured
on
monolayers
of
human
bone
marrow
endothelial
cells
previously
treated
with
EPO
and
IGF
-
IL-3
.

There
was
a
significant
reduction
of
thymidine
incorporation
into
both
erythroid
and
endothelial
cells
in
cultures
pre
-
treated
with
IGF
-
IL-3
and
EPO
.

Endothelial
cell
culture
supernatants
separated
by
ultrafiltration
and
ultracentrifugation
from
cells
treated
with
EPO
and
IL-3
significantly
reduced
thymidine
incorporation
into
erythroid
cells
as
compared
to
identical
fractions
obtained
from
the
media
of
cells
cultured
with
EPO
alone
.

These
results
suggest
that
endothelial
cells
treated
simultaneously
with
EPO
and
IL-3
have
a
negative
effect
on
erythroid
cell
production
.

Sodium
status
influences
chronic

B
nephrotoxicity
in

.

The
nephrotoxic
potential
of
amphotericin
B

(
5
mg
/
kg
per
day
intraperitoneally
for
3
weeks
)
has
been
investigated
in
salt
-
depleted
,
normal
-
salt
,
and
salt
-
loaded
rats
.

In
salt
-
depleted
rats
,
amphotericin
B
decreased
creatinine
clearance
linearly
with
time
,
with
an
85
%
reduction
by
week
3
.

In
contrast
,
in
normal
-
salt
rats
creatinine
clearance
was
decreased
but
to
a
lesser
extent
at
week
2
and
3
,
and
in
salt
-
loaded
rats
creatinine
clearance
did
not
change
for
2
weeks
and
was
decreased
by
43
%
at
week
3
.

All
rats
in
the
sodium

group
had
histopathological
evidence
of
patchy
tubular
cytoplasmic
degeneration
in

that
was
not
observed
in
any
normal

Concentrations
of
amphotericin
B
in
plasma
were
not
significantly
different
among
the
three
groups
at
any
time
during
the
study
.

However
,
at
the
end
of
3
weeks
,
amphotericin
B
levels
in
the
kidneys
and

were
significantly
higher
in

OBJECTIVE
:

This
is
to
present

,
to
focus
on
the
diffusion

imaging
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

From
November
2005
to
September
2007
,
8
patients
(
5
men
and
3
women
)
were
diagnosed
as
having

metronidazole
-induced

encephalopathy

(
age
range
;
43
-
78
years
)
.

They
had
been
taking
metronidazole

(
total
dosage
,
45
-
120
g
;
duration
,
30
days
to
2
months
)
to
treat
the
infection
in
various
organs
.

Initial
brain
magnetic

imaging
(
MRI
)
were
obtained
after
the
hospitalization
,
including
DWI
(
8/8
)
,
apparent
diffusion
coefficient
(
ADC
)
map
(
4/8
)
,
FLAIR
(
7/8
)
,
and
T2-weighted
image
(
8/8
)
.

Follow
-
up
MRIs
were
performed
on
5
patients
from
third
to
14th
days
after
discontinuation
of
metronidazole
administration
.

Findings
of
initial
and
follow
-
up
MRIs
were
retrospectively
evaluated
by
2
neuroradiologists
by
consensus
,
to
analyze
the
presence
of
abnormal
signal
intensities
,
their
locations
,
and
signal
changes
on
follow
-
up
images
.

RESULTS
:

Initial
MRIs
showed
abnormal
high
signal
intensities
on
DWI
and
FLAIR
(
or
T2-weighted
image
)
at
the
dentate
nucleus
(
8/8
)
,
inferior
colliculus
(
6/8
)
,
corpus
callosum
(
2/8
)
,
pons
(
2/8
)
,
medulla
(
1/8
)
,
and
bilateral
cerebral
white
matter
(
1/8
)
.

High
-
signal
intensity
lesions
on
DWI
tended
to
show
low
signal
intensity
on
ADC
map
(
3/4
)
,
but
in
one
patient
,
high
signal
intensity
was
shown
at
bilateral
dentate
nuclei
on
not
only
DWI
but
also
ADC
map
.

All
the
lesions
in
dentate
,
inferior
colliculus
,
pons
,
and
medullas
had
been
resolved
completely
on
follow
-
up
MRIs
in
5
patients
,
but
in
1
patient
of
them
,
corpus
callosal
lesion
persisted
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Reversible
inferior
colliculus
lesions
could
be
considered
as
the
characteristic
for
metronidazole

-induced

encephalopathy
,
next
to
the
dentate

The
incidence
of
postoperative

was
compared
between
five
patients
receiving
a
continuous
i.v
.

infusion
of
morphine

(
mean
73.6
mg
)
and
five
patients
receiving
a
continuous
extradural
infusion
of
0.25
%
bupivacaine
(
mean
192
mg
)
in
the
24-h
period
following

.

Monitoring
consisted
of
airflow
detection
by
a
carbon

analyser
,
chest

occurred
more
frequently
in
patients
who
had
a
morphine
infusion
.

There
was
also
a
higher

to
obtain
volumetric
data
for
the
cerebellum
.

Cerebellar
volume
for
the
patient
group
ranged
between
67.66
and
131.08
ml

(
mean
108.9
ml
)
.

In
addition
3D
gradient
echo
data
sets
from
10
healthy
male
and
10
healthy
female
age
-
matched
volunteers
were
used
to
compare
cerebellar
volumes
.

Using
linear
regression
we
found
that
no
correlation
exists
between
seizure
duration
,
elevation
of
phenytoin
serum
levels
and
cerebellar
volume
.

However
,
multiple
regression
for
the
daily
dosage
,
duration
of
phenytoin
treatment
and
cerebellar
volume
revealed
a
correlation
of
these
parameters
.

We
conclude
that
phenytoin

overdosage
does
not
necessarily
result
in
cerebellar
atrophy

and
it
is
unlikely
that
phenytoin
medication
was
the
only
cause
of
cerebellar
atrophy
in
the
remaining
patients
.

Quantitative
morphometric
studies
of
the
cerebellum
provide
valuable
insights
into
the
pathogenesis
of
cerebellar
disorders
.

Evaluation
of
cardiac
troponin
I
and
T
levels
as
markers
of
myocardial
damage
in
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiomyopathy
rats
,
and
their
relationship
with
echocardiographic
and
histological
findings
.

BACKGROUND
:

Cardiac
troponins

I
(
cTnI
)
and
T
(
cTnT
)
have
been
shown
to
be
highly
sensitive
and
specific
markers
of
myocardial
cell
injury
.

We
investigated
the
diagnostic
value
of
cTnI
and
cTnT
for
the
diagnosis
of
myocardial
damage
in
a
rat
model
of
doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
-induced
cardiomyopathy
,
and
we
examined
the
relationship
between
serial
cTnI
and
cTnT
with
the
development
of
cardiac
disorders
monitored
by
echocardiography
and
histological
examinations
in
this
model
.

METHODS
:

Thirty
-
five
Wistar
rats
were
given
1.5
mg
/
kg
DOX
,
i.v
.
,
weekly
for
up
to
8
weeks
for
a
total
cumulative
dose
of
12
mg
/
kg
BW
.

Ten
rats
received
saline
as
a
control
group
.

cTnI
was
measured
with
Access(R
)

(
ng
/
ml
)
and
a
research
immunoassay
(
pg
/
ml
)
,
and
compared
with
cTnT
,
CK
-
MB
mass
and
CK
.

By
using
transthoracic
echocardiography
,
anterior
and
posterior
wall
thickness
,
LV
diameters
and
LV
fractional
shortening
(
FS
)
were
measured
in
all
rats
before
DOX
or
saline
,
and
at
weeks
6
and
9
after
treatment
in
all
surviving
rats
.

Histology
was
performed
in
DOX
-rats
at
6
and
9
weeks
after
the
last
DOX
dose
and
in
all
controls
.

RESULTS
:

Eighteen
of
the
DOX
rats
died
prematurely
of
general
toxicity
during
the
9-week
period
.

End
-
diastolic
(
ED
)
and
end
-
systolic

(
ES
)
LV
diameters
/
BW
significantly
increased
,
whereas
LV
FS
was
decreased
after
9
weeks
in
the
DOX
group
(
p<0.001
)
.

These
parameters
remained
unchanged
in
controls
.

Histological
evaluation
of
hearts
from
all
rats
given
DOX
revealed
significant
slight
degrees
of
perivascular
and
interstitial
fibrosis
.

In
7
of
the
18
rats
,
degeneration
and
myocyte
vacuolisation
were
found
.

Only
five
of
the
controls
exhibited
evidence
of
very
slight
perivascular
fibrosis
.

A
significant
rise
in
cTnT
was
found
in
DOX
rats
after
cumulative
doses
of
7.5
and
12
mg
/
kg
in
comparison
with
baseline
(
p<0.05
)
.

cTnT
found
in
rats
after
12
mg
/
kg
were
significantly
greater
than
that
found
after
7.5
mg
/
kg
DOX
.

Maximal
cTnI
(
pg
/
ml
)
and
cTnT
levels
were
significantly
increased
in
DOX
rats
compared
with
controls
(
p=0.006
,
0.007
)
.

cTnI
(
ng
/
ml
)
,

CK
-
MB
mass
and
CK
remained
unchanged
in
DOX
rats
compared
with
controls
.

All
markers
remained
stable
in
controls
.

Analysis
of
data
revealed
a
significant
correlation
between
maximal
cTnT
and
ED
and
ES
LV
diameters
/
BW
(
r=0.81
and
0.65
;
p<0.0001
)
.

A
significant
relationship
was
observed
between
maximal
cTnT
and
the
extent
of
myocardial
morphological
changes
,
and
between
LV
diameters
/
BW
and
histological
findings
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Among
markers
of
ischemic
injury
after
DOX
in
rats
,
cTnT
showed
the
greatest
ability
to
detect
myocardial
damage
assessed
by
echocardiographic
detection
and
histological
changes
.

Although
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
the
amount
of
cTnI
and
cTnT
after
DOX
,
probably
due
to
heterogeneity
in
cross
-
reactivities
of
mAbs
to
various
cTnI
and
cTnT
forms
,
it
is
likely
that
cTnT
in
rats
after
DOX
indicates
cell
damage
determined
by
the
magnitude
of
injury
induced
and
that
cTnT
should
be
a
useful
marker
for
the
prediction
of
experimentally
induced

cardiotoxicity
and
possibly
for
cardioprotective
experiments
.

Calcineurin
-
inhibitor
induced
pain
syndrome
(
CIPS
):
a
severe
disabling
complication
after
organ
transplantation
.

Bone
pain

after
transplantation
is
a
frequent
complication
that
can
be
caused
by
several
diseases
.

Treatment
strategies
depend
on
the
correct
diagnosis
of
the
pain
.

Nine
patients
with
severe
pain
in
their
feet
,
which
was
registered
after
transplantation
,
were
investigated
.

Bone
scans
showed
an
increased
tracer
uptake
of
the
foot
bones
.

Magnetic
resonance
imaging
demonstrated
bone
marrow
oedema
in
the
painful
bones
.

Pain
was
not
explained
by
other
diseases
causing
foot
pain
,
like
reflex
sympathetic
dystrophy
,
polyneuropathy
,
Morton
's
neuralgia
,
gout
,
osteoporosis
,
avascular
necrosis
,
intermittent
claudication
,
orthopaedic
foot
deformities
,
stress
fractures
,
and
hyperparathyroidism
.

The
reduction
of
cyclosporine
-
or
tacrolimus
trough
levels
and
the
administration
of
calcium
channel
blockers
led
to
relief
of
pain
.

The
Calcineurin
-
inhibitor
Induced
Pain
Syndrome
(
CIPS
)
is
a
rare
but
severe
side
effect
of
cyclosporine
or
tacrolimus
and
is
accurately
diagnosed
by
its
typical
presentation
,
magnetic
resonance
imaging
and
bone
scans
.

Incorrect
diagnosis
of
the
syndrome
will
lead
to
a
significant
reduction
of
life
quality
in
patients
suffering
from
CIPS
.

The
haemodynamic
effects
of
propofol
in
combination
with
ephedrine
in
elderly
patients

(
ASA
groups
3
and
4
)
.

The
marked
vasodilator
and
negative
inotropic
effects
of
propofol
are
disadvantages
in
frail
elderly
patients
.

We
investigated
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
adding
different
doses
of
ephedrine
to
propofol
in
order
to
obtund
the
hypotensive
response
.

The
haemodynamic
effects
of
adding
15
,
20
or
25
mg
of
ephedrine
to
200
mg
of
propofol
were
compared
to
control
in
40
ASA
3/4
patients
over
60
years
presenting
for
genito
-
urinary
surgery
.

The
addition
of
ephedrine
to
propofol
appears
to
be
an
effective
method
of
obtunding
the
hypotensive
response
to
propofol
at
all
doses
used
in
this
study
.

However
,
marked

tachycardia
associated
with
the
use
of
ephedrine
in
combination
with
propofol
occurred
in
the
majority
of
patients
,
occasionally
reaching
high
levels
in
individual
patients
.

Due
to
the
risk
of
this
tachycardia
inducing
myocardial
ischemia
,
we
would
not
recommend
the
use
in
elderly
patients
of
any
of
the
ephedrine
/
propofol
/mixtures
studied
.

Neurotoxicity
of
halogenated
hydroxyquinolines
:
clinical
analysis
of
cases
reported
outside
Japan
.

An
analysis
is
presented
of
220
cases
of
possible
neurotoxic
reactions
to
halogenated
hydroxyquinolines
reported
from
outside
Japan
.

In
80
cases
insufficient
information
was
available
for
adequate
comment
and
in
29
a
relationship
to
the
administration
of
clioquinol
could
be
excluded
.

Of
the
remainder
,
a
relationship
to
clioquinol
was
considered
probable
in
42
and
possible
in
69
cases
.

In
six
of
the
probable
cases
the
neurological
disturbance
consisted
of
an
acute
reversible
encephalopathy
usually
related
to
the
ingestion
of
a
high
dose
of
clioquinol
over
a
short
period
.

The
most
common
manifestation
,
observed
in
15
further
cases
,
was
isolated

optic
atrophy
.

This
was
most
frequently
found
in
children
,
many
of
whom
had
received
clioquinol
as
treatment
for
acrodermatitis
enteropathica
.

In
the
remaining
cases
,
a
combination
of
myelopathy
,
visual
disturbance
,
and
peripheral
neuropathy
was
the
most
common
manifestation
.

Isolated
myelopathy
or
peripheral
neuropathy
,
or
these
manifestations
occurring
together
,
were
infrequent
.

The
onset
of
all
manifestations
(
except
toxic
encephalopathy
)
was
usually
subacute
,
with
subsequent
partial
recovery
.

Older
subjects
tended
to
display
more
side
effects
.

The
full
syndrome
of
subacute
myelo
-
optic
neuropathy
was
more
frequent
in
women
,
but
they
tended
to
have
taken
greater
quantities
of
the
drug
.

Epileptic
seizures
following
cortical
application
of
fibrin
sealants
containing
tranexamic
acid
in
rats
.

BACKGROUND
:

Fibrin
sealants
(
FS
)
derived
from
human
plasma
are
frequently
used
in
neurosurgery
.

In
order
to
increase
clot
stability
,
FS
typically
contain
aprotinin
,
a
natural
fibrinolysis
inhibitor
.

Recently
,
synthetic
fibrinolysis
inhibitors
such
as
tranexamic
acid

(
tAMCA
)
have
been
considered
as
substitutes
for
aprotinin
.

However
,
tAMCA
has
been
shown
to
cause
epileptic
seizures
.

We
wanted
to
study
whether
tAMCA
retains
its
convulsive
action
if
incorporated
into
a
FS
.

METHOD
:

FS
containing
aprotinin
or
different
concentrations
of
tAMCA
(
0.5
-
47.5
mg
/
ml
)
were
applied
to
the
pial
surface
of
the
cortex
of
anaesthetized
rats
.

The
response
of
the
animals
was
evaluated
using
electroencephalography
and
by
monitoring
the
clinical
behaviour
during
and
after
recovery
from
anaesthesia
.

FINDINGS
:
FS
containing
tAMCA
caused
paroxysmal
brain
activity
which
was
associated
with
distinct
convulsive
behaviours
.

The
degree
of
these
seizures
increased
with
increasing
concentration
of
tAMCA
.

Thus
,
FS
containing
47.5
mg
/
ml
tAMCA
evoked
generalized
seizures
in
all
tested
rats
(
n=6
)
while
the
lowest
concentration
of
tAMCA

(
0.5
mg
/
ml
)

only
evoked
brief
episodes
of
jerk
-
correlated
convulsive
potentials
in
1
of
6
rats
.

In
contrast
,
FS
containing
aprotinin
did
not
evoke
any
paroxysmal
activity
.

INTERPRETATION
:

Tranexamic
acid
retains
its
convulsive
action
within
FS
.

Thus
,
use
of
FS
containing
tAMCA
for
surgery
within
or
close
to
the
CNS
may
pose
a
substantial
risk
to
the
patient
.

A
diet
promoting
sugar
dependency
causes

behavioral
cross
-
sensitization
to
a
low
dose
of
amphetamine
.

Previous
research
in
this
laboratory
has
shown
that
a
diet
of
intermittent
excessive
sugar
consumption
produces
a
state
with
neurochemical
and
behavioral
similarities
to
drug
dependency
.

The
present
study
examined
whether
female
rats
on
various
regimens
of
sugar
access
would
show
behavioral
cross
-
sensitization
to
a
low
dose
of
amphetamine
.

After
a
30-min
baseline
measure
of
locomotor
activity
(
day
0
)
,
animals
were
maintained
on
a
cyclic
diet
of
12-h
deprivation
followed
by
12-h
access
to
10
%
sucrose
solution
and
chow
pellets
(
12
h
access
starting
4
h
after
onset
of
the
dark
period
)
for
21
days
.

Locomotor
activity
was
measured
again
for
30
min
at
the
beginning
of
days
1
and
21
of
sugar
access
.

Beginning
on
day
22
,
all
rats
were
maintained
on
ad
libitum
chow
.

Nine
days
later
locomotor
activity
was
measured
in
response
to
a
single
low
dose
of
amphetamine

(
0.5
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
animals
that
had
experienced
cyclic
sucrose
and
chow
were
hyperactive

in
response
to
amphetamine
compared
with
four
control
groups
(
ad
libitum
10
%
sucrose
and
chow
followed
by
amphetamine
injection
,
cyclic
chow
followed
by
amphetamine
injection
,
ad
libitum
chow
with
amphetamine
,
or
cyclic
10
%
sucrose
and
chow
with
a
saline
injection
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
a
diet
comprised
of
alternating
deprivation
and
access
to
a
sugar
solution
and
chow
produces
bingeing
on
sugar
that
leads
to
a
long
lasting
state
of
increased
sensitivity
to
amphetamine
,
possibly
due
to
a
lasting
alteration
in
the
dopamine
system
.

D
-
penicillamine
-induced
angiopathy
in
rats
.

The
effect
of
high
dose
D
-
penicillamine
treatment
on
aortic
permeability
to
albumin
and
on
the
ultrastructure
of
the
vessel
.

Male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
treated
with
D
-
penicillamine

(
D
-
pen
)
500
mg
/
kg
/
day
for
10
or
42
days
.

Pair
fed
rats
served
as
controls
.

Changes
in
aortic
morphology
were
examined
by
light-
and
transmission
-
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
.

In
addition
,
the
endothelial
permeability
and
the
penetration
through
the
aortic
wall
of
albumin
were
studied
10
minutes
,
24
and
48
hours
after
i.
v.
injection
of
human
serum
131I
-
albumin
(
131I
-
HSA
)
.

TEM
revealed
extensive
elastolysis
in
the
arterial
wall
of
D
-
pen

-treated
rats
,
consistent
with
an
inhibitory
effect
on
crosslink
formation
.

In
experimental
animals
excess
deposition
of
collagen
and
glycoaminoglycans
was
observed
in
the
subendothelial
and
medial
layer
of
the
aortic
wall
,
together
with
prominent
basal
membrane
substance
around
aortic
smooth
muscle
cells
.

The
aorta
/
serum
-
ratio
and
the
radioactive
build
-
up
24
and
48
hours
after
injection
of
131I
-
HSA
was
reduced
in
animals
treated
with
D
-
pen
for
42
days
,
indicating
an
impeded
transmural
transport
of
tracer
which
may
be
caused
by
a
steric
exclusion
effect
of
abundant
hyaluronate
.

The
endothelial
ultrastructure
was
unaffected
by
D
-
pen
,
and
no
differences
in
aortic
131I
-
HSA
radioactivity
or
aorta
/
serum
-
ratio
were
recorded
between
experimental
and
control
groups
10
minutes
after
tracer
injection
,
indicating
that
the
permeability
of
the
endothelial
barrier
to
albumin
remained
unaffected
by
D
-
pen
treatment
.

These
observations
support
the
hypothesis
that
treatment
with
high
doses
of
D
-
pen
may
induce
a
fibroproliferative
response
in
rat
aorta
,
possibly
by
an
inhibitory
effect
on
the
cross
-
linking
of
collagen
and
elastin
.

Brain
natriuretic
peptide
is
a
predictor
of
anthracycline
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

Anthracyclines
are
effective
antineoplastic
drugs
,
but
they
frequently
cause
dose
-
related
cardiotoxicity
.

The
cardiotoxicity
of
conventional
anthracycline
therapy
highlights
a
need
to
search
for
methods
that
are
highly
sensitive
and
capable
of
predicting
cardiac
dysfunction
.

We
measured
the
plasma
level
of
brain
natriuretic
peptide
(
BNP
)
to
determine
whether
BNP
might
serve
as
a
simple
diagnostic
indicator
of
anthracycline
-induced
cardiotoxicity
in
patients
with
acute
leukemia
treated
with
a
daunorubicin

(
DNR
)
-containing
regimen
.

Thirteen
patients
with
acute
leukemia
were
treated
with
a
DNR
-containing
regimen
.

Cardiac
functions
were
evaluated
with
radionuclide
angiography
before
chemotherapies
.

The
plasma
levels
of
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
(
ANP
)
and
BNP
were
measured
at
the
time
of
radionuclide
angiography
.

Three
patients
developed
congestive
heart
failure
after
the
completion
of
chemotherapy
.

Five
patients
were
diagnosed
as
having
subclinical
heart
failure
after
the
completion
of
chemotherapy
.

The
plasma
levels
of
BNP
in
all
the
patients
with
clinical
and
subclinical
heart
failure
increased
above
the
normal
limit
(
40
pg
/
ml
)
before
the
detection
of
clinical
or
subclinical
heart
failure
by
radionuclide
angiography
.

On
the
other
hand
,
BNP
did
not
increase
in
the
patients
without
heart
failure
given
DNR
,
even
at
more
than
700
mg
/
m(2
)
.

The
plasma
level
of
ANP
did
not
always
increase
in
all
the
patients
with
clinical
and
subclinical
heart
failure
.

These
preliminary
results
suggest
that
BNP
may
be
useful
as
an
early
and
sensitive
indicator
of
anthracycline

-induced

cardiotoxicity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Reassuringly
,
penicillins
,
erythromycins
,
and
cephalosporins
,
although
used
commonly
by
pregnant
women
,
were
not
associated
with
many
birth
defects
.

Sulfonamides
and
nitrofurantoins
were
associated
with
several
birth
defects
,
indicating
a
need
for
additional
scrutiny
.

Incidence
of
neoplasms
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
exposed
to
different
treatment
regimens
.

Immunosuppressive
drugs
have
been
used
during
the
last
30
years
in
treatment
of
patients
with
severe
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

The
drugs
commonly
used
are
cyclophosphamide
and
chlorambucil

(
alkylating
agents
)
,
azathioprine

(
purine
analogue
)
,
and
methotrexate
(
folic
acid
analogue
)
.

There
is
evidence
that
all
four
immunosuppressive
drugs
can
reduce
synovitis
,
but
disease
activity
almost
always
recurs
after
therapy
is
stopped
.

Since
adverse
reactions
are
frequent
,
less
than
50
percent
of
patients
are
able
to
continue
a
particular
drug
for
more
than
one
year
.

Since
it
takes
three
to
12
months
to
achieve
maximal
effects
,
those
patients
who
are
unable
to
continue
the
drug
receive
little
benefit
from
it
.

Patients
treated
with
alkylating
agents
have
an
increased
risk
of
development
of
acute
nonlymphocytic
leukemia
,
and
both
alkylating
agents
and
azathioprine
are
associated
with
the
development
of
non
-
Hodgkin
's
lymphoma
.

Cyclophosphamide
therapy
increases
the
risk
of
carcinoma
of
the
bladder
.

There
have
been
several
long
-
term
studies
of
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
treated
with
azathioprine
and
cyclophosphamide
and
the
incidence
of
most
of
the
common
cancers
is
not
increased
.

Data
on
the
possible
increased
risk
of
malignancy
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
are
still
being
collected
,
and
until
further
information
is
available
,
the
use
of
immunosuppressive
drugs
,
particularly
alkylating
agents
,
in
the
treatment
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
should
be
reserved
for
patients
with
severe
progressive
disease
or
life
-
threatening
complications
.

Patterns
of
hepatic
injury
induced
by
methyldopa
.

Twelve
patients
with
liver
disease
related
to
methyldopa
were
seen
between
1967
and
1977
.

Illness
occurred
within
1
-
-9
weeks
of
commencement
of
therapy
in
9
patients
,
the
remaining
3
patients
having
received
the
drug
for
13
months
,
15
months
and
7
years
before
experiencing
symptoms
.

Jaundice
with
tender
hepatomegaly
,
usually
preceded
by
symptoms
of
malaise
,
anorexia
,
nausea
and
vomiting
,
and
associated
with
upper
abdominal
pain
,
was
an
invariable
finding
in
all
patients
.

Biochemical
liver
function
tests
indicated
hepatocellular
necrosis
and
correlated
with
histopathological
evidence
of
hepatic
injury
,
the
spectrum
of
which
ranged
from
fatty
change
and
focal
hepatocellular
necrosis
to
massive
hepatic
necrosis
.

Most
patients
showed
moderate
to
severe
acute
hepatitis
or
chronic
active
hepatitis
with
associated
cholestasis
.

The
drug
was
withdrawn
on
presentation
to
hospital
in
11
patients
,
with
rapid
clinical
improvement
in
9
.

One
patient
died
,
having
presented
in
hepatic
failure
,
and
another
,
who
had
been
taking
methyldopa
for
7
years
,
showed
slower
clinical
and
biochemical
resolution
over
a
period
of
several
months
.

The
remaining
patient
in
the
series
developed

fulminant
hepatitis
when
the
drug
was
accidentally
recommenced
1
year
after
a
prior
episode
of
methyldopa

-induced
hepatitis
.

In
this
latter
patient
,
and
in
2
others
,
the
causal
relationship
between
methyldopa
and
hepatic
dysfunction
was
proved
with
the
recurrence
of
hepatitis
within
2
weeks
of
re
-
exposure
to
the
drug
.

A
phase
I
/
II
study
of
paclitaxel
plus
cisplatin
as
first
-
line
therapy
for
head
and
neck
cancers
:
preliminary
results
.

Improved
outcomes
among
patients
with
head
and
neck
carcinomas
require
investigations
of
new
drugs
for
induction
therapy
.

Preliminary
results
of
an
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
study
of
single
-
agent
paclitaxel

(
Taxol
;
Bristol
-
Myers
Squibb
Company
,
Princeton
,
NJ
)
reported
a
37
%
response
rate
in
patients
with
head
and
neck
cancer
,
and
the
paclitaxel
/
cisplatin
combination
has
been
used
successfully
and
has
significantly
improved
median
response
duration
in
ovarian
cancer
patients
.

We
initiated
a
phase
I
/
II
trial
to
determine
the
response
and
toxicity
of
escalating
paclitaxel
doses
combined
with
fixed
-
dose
cisplatin
with
granulocyte
colony
-
stimulating
factor
support
in
patients
with
untreated
locally
advanced
inoperable
head
and
neck
carcinoma
.

To
date
,
23
men
with
a
median
age
of
50
years
and
good
performance
status
have
entered
the
trial
.

Primary
tumor

sites
were
oropharynx
,
10
patients
;
hypopharynx
,
four
;
larynx
,
two
;
oral
cavity
,
three
;
unknown
primary
,
two
;
and
nasal
cavity
and
parotid
gland
,
one
each
.

Of
20
patients
evaluable
for
toxicity
,
four
had
stage
III
and
16
had
stage
IV
disease
.

Treatment
,
given
every
21
days
for
a
maximum
of
three
cycles
,
consisted
of
paclitaxel
by
3-hour
infusion
followed
the
next
day
by
a
fixed
dose
of
cisplatin

(
75
mg
/
m2
)
.

The
dose
levels
incorporate
escalating
paclitaxel
doses
,
and
intrapatient
escalations
within
a
given
dose
level
are
permitted
if
toxicity
permits
.

At
the
time
of
this
writing
,
dose
level
4
(
260
,
270
,
and
280
mg
/
m2
)
is
being
evaluated
;
three
patients
from
this
level
are
evaluable
.

With
paclitaxel
doses
of
200
mg
/
m2
and
higher
,
granulocyte
colony
-
stimulating
factor
5
micrograms
/
kg
/
d
is
given
(
days
4
through
12
)
.

Of
18
patients
evaluable
for
response
,
seven
(
39
%
)
achieved
a
complete
response
and
six
(
33
%
)
achieved
a
partial
response
.

Three
patients
had
no
change
and
disease
progressed
in
two
.

The
overall
response
rate
is
72
%
.

Eleven
responding
patients
had
subsequent
surgery
/
radiotherapy
or
radical
radiotherapy
.

Two
pathologic
complete
responses
were
observed
in
patients
who
had
achieved
clinical
complete
responses
.

Alopecia
,
paresthesias
,
and
arthralgias
/
myalgias
have
occurred
frequently
,
but
with
one
exception
(
a
grade
3
myalgia
)
they
have
been
grade
1
or
2
.

No
dose
-
limiting
hematologic

toxicity
has
been
seen
.

Paclitaxel
/
cisplatin
is
an
effective
first
-
line
regimen
for
locoregionally
advanced
head
and
neck
cancer
and
continued
study
is
warranted
.

Results
thus
far
suggest
no
dose

response
effect
for
paclitaxel
doses
above
200
mg

were
evaluable
.

Maximum

,
and
in

Differential
effects
of
gamma
-
hexachlorocyclohexane

(
lindane
)
on
pharmacologically
-
induced
seizures
.

Gamma
-
hexachlorocyclohexane
(
gamma
-
HCH
)
,
the
active
ingredient
of
the
insecticide
lindane
,
has
been
shown
to
decrease
seizure
threshold
to
pentylenetrazol
(
PTZ
)
3
h
after
exposure
to
gamma
-
HCH
and
conversely
increase
threshold
to
PTZ

-induced

seizures
24
h
after
exposure
to
gamma
-
HCH

(
Vohland
et
al
.
1981
)
.

In
this
study
,
the
severity
of
response
to
other
seizure
-inducing
agents
was
tested
in
mice
1
and
24
h
after
intraperitoneal
administration
of
80
mg
/
kg

gamma
-
HCH
.

One
hour
after
the
administration
of
gamma
-
HCH
,
the
activity
of
seizure

-inducing
agents
was
increased
,
regardless
of
their
mechanism
,
while
24
h
after
gamma
-
HCH
a
differential
response
was
observed
.

Seizure
activity
due
to
PTZ
and
picrotoxin

(
PTX
)
was
significantly
decreased
;
however
,
seizure
activity
due
to
3-mercaptopropionic
acid

(
MPA
)
,
bicuculline

(
BCC
)
,
methyl
6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl
-
B
-
carboline-3-carboxylate

(
DMCM
)
,
or
strychnine

(
STR
)
was
not
different
from
control
.

In
vitro
,
gamma
-
HCH
,
pentylenetetrazol
and
picrotoxin
were
shown
to
inhibit
3H
-
TBOB
binding
in
mouse
whole
brain
,
with
IC50
values
of
4.6
,
404
and
9.4
microM
,
respectively
.

MPA
,
BCC
,
DMCM
,
and
STR
showed
no
inhibition
of
3H
-
TBOB

(
t
-
butyl
bicyclo
-
orthobenzoate
)
binding
at
concentrations
of
100
micron
.

The
pharmacological
challenge
data
suggest
that
tolerance
may
occur
to
seizure
activity
induced
by
PTZ
and
PTX
24
h
after
gamma
-
HCH
,
since
the
response
to
only
these
two
seizure
-inducing
agents
is
decreased
.

The
in
vitro
data
suggest
that
the
site
responsible
for
the
decrease
in
seizure
activity
24
h
after
gamma
-
HCH
may
be
the
GABA
-A
receptor
-
linked
chloride
channel
.

Severe
ocular
and
orbital
toxicity
after
intracarotid
injection
of
carboplatin
for
recurrent
glioblastomas
.

BACKGROUND
:

Glioblastoma
is
a
malignant
tumor
that
occurs
in
the
cerebrum
during
adulthood
.

With
current
treatment
regimens
including
combined
surgery
,
radiation
and
chemotherapy
,
the
average
life
expectancy
of
the
patients
is
limited
to
approximately
1
year
.

Therefore
,
patients
with
glioblastoma
sometimes
have
intracarotid
injection
of
carcinostatics
added
to
the
treatment
regimen
.

Generally
,
carboplatin
is
said
to
have
milder
side
effects
than
cisplatin
,

whose
ocular
and
orbital
toxicity
are
well
known
.

However
,
we
experienced
a
case
of
severe
ocular
and
orbital
toxicity
after
intracarotid
injection
of
carboplatin
,
which
is
infrequently
reported
.

CASE
:

A
58-year
-
old
man
received
an
intracarotid
injection
of
carboplatin
for
recurrent
glioblastomas
in
his
left
temporal
lobe
.

He
complained
of
pain
and
visual
disturbance
in
the
ipsilateral
eye
30
h
after
the
injection
.

Various
ocular
symptoms
and
findings
caused
by
carboplatin

toxicity
were
seen
.

RESULTS
:

He
was
treated
with
intravenous
administration
of
corticosteroids
and
glycerin
for
6
days
after
the
injection
.

Although
the
intraocular
pressure
elevation
caused
by
secondary
acute
angle
-
closure
glaucoma
decreased
and
ocular
pain
diminished
,
inexorable

papilledema
and
exudative

retinal
detachment
continued
for
3
weeks
.

Finally
,
6
weeks
later
,
diffuse
chorioretinal
atrophy
with
optic
atrophy
occurred
and
the
vision
in
his
left
eye
was
lost
.

CONCLUSION
:

When
performing
intracarotid
injection
of
carboplatin
,
we
must
be
aware
of
its
potentially
blinding
ocular
toxicity
.

It
is
recommended
that
further
studies
and
investigations
are
undertaken
in
the
effort
to
minimize
such
severe
side
effects
.

Alpha
-
lipoic
acid
prevents

mitochondrial
damage
and
neurotoxicity
in
experimental
chemotherapy
neuropathy
.

The
study
investigates
if
alpha
-
lipoic
acid
is
neuroprotective
against
chemotherapy
induced
neurotoxicity
,
if
mitochondrial
damage
plays
a
critical
role
in
toxic
neurodegenerative
cascade
,
and
if
neuroprotective
effects
of
alpha
-
lipoic
acid
depend
on
mitochondria
protection
.

We
used
an
in
vitro
model
of
chemotherapy
induced

peripheral
neuropathy
that
closely
mimic
the
in
vivo
condition
by
exposing
primary
cultures
of
dorsal
root
ganglion
(
DRG
)
sensory
neurons
to
paclitaxel
and
cisplatin
,
two
widely
used
and
highly
effective
chemotherapeutic
drugs
.

This
approach
allowed
investigating
the
efficacy
of
alpha
-
lipoic
acid
in
preventing
axonal
damage
and
apoptosis
and
the
function
and
ultrastructural
morphology
of
mitochondria
after
exposure
to
toxic
agents
and
alpha
-
lipoic
acid
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
both
cisplatin
and
paclitaxel
cause
early
mitochondrial
impairment
with
loss
of
membrane
potential
and
induction
of
autophagic
vacuoles
in
neurons
.

Alpha
-
lipoic
acid
exerts
neuroprotective
effects
against
chemotherapy
induced
neurotoxicity
in
sensory
neurons
:
it
rescues
the
mitochondrial
toxicity
and
induces
the
expression
of
frataxin
,
an
essential
mitochondrial
protein
with
anti
-
oxidant
and
chaperone
properties
.

In
conclusion
mitochondrial
toxicity
is
an
early
common
event
both
in
paclitaxel
and
cisplatin
induced
neurotoxicity
.

Alpha
-
lipoic
acid
protects
sensory
neurons
through
its
anti
-
oxidant
and
mitochondrial
regulatory
functions
,
possibly
inducing
the
expression
of
frataxin
.

These
findings
suggest
that
alpha
-
lipoic
acid
might
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
peripheral
nerve
toxicity
in
patients
undergoing
chemotherapy
and
encourage
further
confirmatory
clinical
trials
.

Optimising

Atrial

is
associated
with
substantial
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Pooled
data
from
trials
comparing
antithrombotic
treatment
with
placebo
have
shown
that
warfarin
reduces
the
risk
of
stroke
by
62
%
,
and
that
aspirin
alone
reduces
the
risk
by
22
%
.

Overall
,
in
high
-
risk
patients
,
warfarin
is
superior
to
aspirin
in
preventing
strokes
,
with
a
relative
risk
reduction
of
36
%
.

Ximelagatran

,
was
found
to
be
as

Interaction
of
cyclosporin
A
with
antineoplastic
agents
.

A
synergistic
effect
of
etoposide
and
cyclosporin
A
was
observed
in
a
patient
with
acute
T
-
lymphocytic
leukemia
in
relapse
.

The
concomitant
administration
of
etoposide
and
cyclosporin
A
resulted
in
eradication
of
hitherto
refractory
leukemic
infiltration
of
bone
marrow
.

Severe
side
effects
in
terms
of
mental
confusion
and
progressive
hyperbilirubinemia
,
however
,
point
to
an
enhancement
not
only
of
antineoplastic
effects
but
also
of
toxicity
in
normal
tissues
.

This
report
demonstrates
for
the
first
time
that
the
pharmacodynamic
properties
of
cyclosporin
A
may
not
be
confined
strictly
to
suppression
of
normal
T

cell
functions
.

The
hematologic
effects
of
cefonicid
and
cefazedone
in
the
dog
:
a
potential
model
of
cephalosporin
hematotoxicity
in
man
.

Cephalosporin
antibiotics
cause
a
variety
of
hematologic
disturbances
in
man
,
the
pathogeneses
and
hematopathology
of
which
remain
poorly
characterized
.

There
is
a
need
for
a
well
-
defined
animal
model
in
which
these
blood
dyscrasias
can
be
studied
.

In
four
subacute
toxicity
studies
,
the
intravenous
administration
of
cefonicid
or
cefazedone
to
beagle
dogs
caused
a
dose
-
dependent
incidence
of
anemia
,
neutropenia
,
and
thrombocytopenia
after
1
-
3
months
of
treatment
.

A
nonregenerative
anemia
was
the
most
compromising
of
the
cytopenias
and
occurred
in
approximately
50
%
of
dogs
receiving
400
-
500
mg
/
kg
cefonicid
or
540
-
840
mg
/
kg

cefazedone
.

All
three
cytopenias
were
completely
reversible
following
cessation
of
treatment
;
the
time
required
for
recovery
of
the
erythron
(
approximately
1
month
)
was
considerably
longer
than
that
of
the
granulocytes
and
platelets
(
hours
to
a
few
days
)
.

Upon
rechallenge
with
either
cephalosporin
,
the
hematologic
syndrome
was
reproduced
in
most
dogs
tested
;
cefonicid
(
but
not
cefazedone
)

-treated
dogs
showed
a
substantially
reduced
induction
period
(
15
+
/-
5
days
)
compared
to
that
of
the
first
exposure
to
the
drug
(
61
+
/-

24
days
)
.

This
observation
,
along
with
the
rapid
rate
of
decline
in
red
cell
mass
parameters
of
affected
dogs
,
suggests
that
a
hemolytic
component
complicated
the
red
cell
production
problem
and
that
multiple
toxicologic
mechanisms
contributed
to
the
cytopenia
.

We
conclude
that
the
administration
of
high
doses
of
cefonicid
or
cefazedone
to
dogs
can
induce
hematotoxicity
similar
to
the
cephalosporin
-induced

blood
dyscrasias
described
in
man
and
thus
provides
a
useful
model
for
studying
the
mechanisms
of
these
disorders
.

A
pyridoxine
-dependent

behavioral
disorder
unmasked
by
isoniazid
.

A
3-year
-
old
girl
had
behavioral
deterioration
,
with
hyperkinesis
,
irritability
,
and
sleeping
difficulties
after
the
therapeutic
administration
of
isoniazid
.

The
administration
of
pharmacologic
doses
of
pyridoxine
hydrochloride
led
to
a
disappearance
of
symptoms
.

After
discontinuing
isoniazid
therapy
a
similar
pattern
of
behavior
was
noted
that
was
controlled
by
pyridoxine
.

A
placebo
had
no
effect
,
but
niacinamide
was
as
effective
as
pyridoxine
.

Periodic
withdrawal
of
pyridoxine
was
associated
with
return
of
the
hyperkinesis
.

The
level
of
pyridoxal
in
the
blood
was
normal
during
the
periods
of
relapse
.

Metabolic
studies
suggested
a
block
in
the
kynurenine
pathway
of
tryptophan
metabolism
.

The
patient
has
been
followed
for
six
years
and
has
required
pharmacologic
doses
of
pyridoxine
to
control
her
behavior

These

Prolonged

We
report
the
case
of
a
patient
in
whom
troleandomycin
-induced
hepatitis
was
followed
by
prolonged
anicteric
cholestasis
.

Jaundice
occurred
after
administration
of
troleandomycin
for
7
days
and
was
associated
with
hypereosinophilia
.

Jaundice
disappeared
within
3
months

was
followed
by
prolonged
anicteric
cholestasis
marked
by
pruritus
and
high
levels
of
alkaline

Finally
,
pruritus
disappeared
within
19
months
,
and
liver
tests
returned
to
normal
27
months
after
the
onset
of

.

This
observation
demonstrates
that
prolonged
cholestasis
can
follow
troleandomycin
-induced
acute
hepatitis
.

HMG

inhibitors
.

Current
clinical
experience
.

Lovastatin
and
simvastatin
are
the
2
best
-
known
members
of
the
class
of
hypolipidaemic
agents
known
as
HMG
CoA
reductase
inhibitors
.

Clinical
experience
with
lovastatin
includes
over
5000
patients
,
700
of
whom
have
been
treated
for
2
years
or
more
,
and
experience
with
simvastatin
includes
over
3500
patients
,
of
whom
350
have
been
treated
for
18
months
or
more
.

Lovastatin
has
been
marketed
in
the
United
States
for
over
6
months
.

Both
agents
show
substantial
clinical
efficacy
,
with
reductions
in
total
cholesterol
of
over
30
%
and
in
LDL-
cholesterol
of
40
%
in
clinical
studies
.

Modest
increases
in
HDL-
cholesterol
levels
of
about
10
%
are
also
reported
.

Clinical
tolerability
of
both
agents
has
been
good
,
with
fewer
than
3
%
of
patients
withdrawn
from
treatment
because
of
clinical
adverse
experiences
.

Ophthalmological
examinations
in
over
1100
patients
treated
with
one
or
the
other
agent
have
revealed
no
evidence
of
significant
short
term
(
up
to
2
years
)
cataractogenic
potential
.

One
to
2
%
of
patients
have
elevations
of
serum
transaminases
to
greater
than
3
times
the
upper
limit
of
normal
.

These
episodes
are
asymptomatic
and
reversible
when
therapy
is
discontinued
.

Minor
elevations
of
creatine
kinase
levels
are
reported
in
about
5
%
of
patients
.

Myopathy
,
associated
in
some
cases
with
myoglobinuria
,
and
in
2
cases

has
been
rarely
reported
with
lovastatin
,
especially
in
patients
concomitantly
treated
with
cyclosporin
,
gemfibrozil
or
niacin
.

Lovastatin
and
simvastatin
are
both
effective
and
well
-
tolerated
agents
for
lowering
elevated
levels
of
serum
cholesterol
.

As
wider
use
confirms
their
safety
profile
,
they
will
gain
increasing
importance
in
the
therapeutic
approach
to
hypercholesterolaemia
and
its
consequences

Sulfasalazine
-induced
lupus
erythematosus
.

Pneumonitis
,
bilateral
pleural
effusions
,
echocardiographic
evidence
of
cardiac
tamponade
,
and
positive
autoantibodies
developed
in
a
43-year
-
old
man
,
who
was
receiving
long
-
term
sulfasalazine
therapy
for
chronic
ulcerative
colitis
.

After
cessation
of
the
sulfasalazine
and
completion
of
a
six
-
week
course
of
corticosteroids
,
these
problems
resolved
over
a
period
of
four
to
six
months
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
patient
had
sulfasalazine
-induced
lupus
,
which
manifested
with
serositis
and
pulmonary
parenchymal
involvement
in
the
absence
of
joint
symptoms
.

Physicians
who
use
sulfasalazine
to
treat
patients
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
should
be
aware
of
the
signs
of
sulfasalazine
-induced

lupus
syndrome
.

Optimization
of
levodopa
therapy
.

While
there
is
no
single
correct
starting
dose
for
levodopa
therapy
,
many
individuals
can
be
started
on
either
the
25/100
or
controlled
-
release
formula
,
following
the
general
rule
not
to
attempt
to
titrate
carbidopa
-
levodopa
to
the
point
of
"
normality
,
"
which
can
lead
to
toxicity
.

The
physician
should
also
determine
the
proper
use
of
any
adjunctive
medications
;
such
combined
therapy
has
become
the
standard
approach
to
treatment
.

Following
the
initial
period
of
therapy
,
emerging
difficulties
require
a
reassessment
of
therapeutic
approaches
,
such
as
dosage
adjustment
or
introduction
of
a

disorders
,
orthostatic

Alpha
and
beta
coma
in
drug
intoxication
uncomplicated
by
cerebral
hypoxia
.

Four
patients
who
were
rendered
comatose
or
stuporous
by
drug
intoxication
,
but
who
were
not
hypoxic
,
are
described
.

Three
patients
received
high
doses
of
chlormethiazole
for
alcohol
withdrawal
symptoms
,
and
one
took
a
suicidal
overdose
of
nitrazepam
.

The
patient
with
nitrazepam
overdose
and
two
of
those
with
chlormethiazole
intoxication
conformed
to
the
criteria
of
'
alpha
coma
'
,
showing
non
-
reactive
generalized
or
frontally
predominant
alpha
activity
in
the
EEG
.

The
fourth
patient
who
was
unconscious
after
chlormethiazole
administration
exhibite
generalized
non
-
reactive
activity
in
the
slow
beta
range
.

All
four
recovered
completely
without
neurological
sequelae
following
the
withdrawal
of
the
offending
agents
.

The
similarities
between
the
effects
of
structural
lesions
and
pharmacological
depression
of
the
brain
stem
reticular
formation
are
discussed
.

It
is
suggested
that
in
both
situations
disturbed
reticulo
-
thalamic
interactions
are
important
in
the
pathogenesis
of
alpha
coma
.

It
is
concluded
that
when
this
electroencephalographic
and
behavioural
picture
is
seen
in
drug
intoxication
,
in
the
absence
of
significant
hypoxaemia
,
a
favourable
outcome
may
be
anticipated
.

Omitting
fentanyl
reduces

nausea
and
vomiting
,
without
increasing
pain
,
after
sevoflurane
for
day
surgery
.

BACKGROUND
AND
OBJECTIVE
:

Despite
advantages
of
induction
and
maintenance
of
anaesthesia
with
sevoflurane
,
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
occurs
frequently
.

Fentanyl
is
a
commonly
used
supplement
that
may
contribute
to
this
,
although
it
may
also
improve
analgesia
.

METHODS
:

This
double
-
blind
study
examined
the
incidence
and
severity
of
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
and
pain
in
the
first
24
h
after
sevoflurane
anaesthesia
in
216
adult
day
surgery
patients
.

Patients
were
randomly
allocated
to
either
receive
or
not
receive
1
1
fentanyl
,
while
a
third
group
received
dexamethasone
in
addition
to
fentanyl
.

RESULTS
:

Omission
of
fentanyl
did
not
reduce
the
overall
incidence
of
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
,
but
did
reduce
the
incidence
of
vomiting
and/or
moderate
to
severe
nausea
prior
to
discharge
from
20
%
and
17
%
with
fentanyl
and
fentanyl
-
dexamethasone
,
respectively
,
to
5
%
(
P
=
0.013
)
.

Antiemetic
requirements
were
reduced
from
24
%
and
31
%
to
7
%
(
P
=
0.0012
)
.

Dexamethasone
had
no
significant
effect
on
the
incidence
or
severity
of
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
.

Combining
the
two
fentanyl
groups
revealed
further
significant
benefits
from
the
avoidance
of
opioids
,
reducing
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
and
nausea
prior
to
discharge
from
35
%
and
33
%
to
22
%
and
19
%
(
P
=
0.049
and
P
=
0.035
)
,
respectively
,
while
nausea
in
the
first
24
h
was
decreased
from
42
%
to
27
%
(
P
=
0.034
)
.

Pain
severity
and
analgesic
requirements
were
unaffected
by
the
omission
of
fentanyl
.

Fentanyl
did
reduce
minor
intraoperative
movement
but
had
no
sevoflurane

-sparing
effect
and
increased

respiratory
depression
,
hypotension
and
bradycardia
.

CONCLUSION
:

As
fentanyl
exacerbated

postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
without
an
improvement
in
postoperative
pain
and
also
had
adverse
cardiorespiratory
effects
,
it
appears
to
be
an
unnecessary
and
possibly
detrimental
supplement
to
sevoflurane
in
day
surgery
.

Renal
Fanconi
syndrome
and
myopathy
after
liver
transplantation
:
drug
-
related
mitochondrial
cytopathy
?

Advances
in
the
field
of
transplantation
provide
a
better
quality
of
life
and
allow
more
favorable
conditions
for
growth
and
development
in
children
.

However
,
combinations
of
different
therapeutic
regimens
require
consideration
of
potential
adverse
reactions
.

We
describe
a
15-yr
-
old
girl
who
had
orthotopic
liver
transplantation
because
of
Wilson
's
disease
.

Tacrolimus
,
MMF
,
and
steroids
were
given
as
immunosuppressant
.

Lamivudine
was
added
because
of
de
nova
hepatitis
B
infection
during
her
follow
-
up
.

Three
yr
after
transplantation
she
developed

renal
Fanconi
syndrome
with
severe
metabolic
acidosis
,
hypophosphatemia
,
glycosuria
,
and
aminoaciduria
.

Although
tacrolimus
was
suspected
to
be
the
cause
of
late
post
-
transplant
renal
acidosis
and
was
replaced
by
sirolimus
,
acidosis
,
and
electrolyte
imbalance
got
worse
.

Proximal
muscle
weakness
has
developed
during
her
follow
-
up
.

Fanconi
syndrome
,
as
well
as
myopathy
,
is
well
recognized
in
patients
with
mitochondrial
disorders
and
caused
by
depletion
of
mtDNA
.

We
suggest
that
our
patient
's
tubular
dysfunction
and
myopathy
may
have
resulted
from
mitochondrial
dysfunction
which
is
triggered
by
tacrolimus
and
augmented
by
lamivudine
.

Antipsychotic
-
like
profile
of
thioperamide
,
a
selective
H3-receptor
antagonist
in
mice
.

Experimental
and
clinical
evidence
points
to
a
role
of
central
histaminergic
system
in
the
pathogenesis
of
schizophrenia
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
study
the
effect
of
histamine
H(3)-receptor
ligands
on
neuroleptic
-
induced
catalepsy
,

apomorphine
-induced
climbing
behavior
and
amphetamine
-induced
locomotor
activities
in
mice
.

Catalepsy
was
induced
by
haloperidol

(
2
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
)
,
while
apomorphine
(
1.5
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)
and
amphetamine

(
2
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)
were
used
for
studying
climbing
behavior
and
locomotor
activities
,
respectively
.

(
R)-alpha
-
methylhistamine

(
RAMH
)
(
5
microg
i.c.v
.
)
and
thioperamide

(
THP
)
(
15
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
,
per
se
did
not
cause
catalepsy
.

Administration
of
THP

(
3.75
,
7.5
and
15
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

1
h
prior
to
haloperidol
resulted
in
a
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
the
catalepsy
times
(
P
0.05
)
.

However
,
pretreatment
with
RAMH
significantly
reversed
such
an
effect
of
THP

(
15
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

RAMH
per
se
showed
significant
reduction
in
locomotor
time
,
distance
traveled
and
average
speed
but
THP
(
15
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
per
se
had
no
effect
on
these
parameters
.

On
amphetamine
-induced
hyperactivity
,
THP
(
3.75
and
7.5
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

reduced
locomotor
time
,
distance
traveled
and
average
speed
(
P
0.05
)
.

Pretreatment
with
RAMH

(
5
microg
i.c.v
.
)

could
partially
reverse
such
effects
of
THP

(
3.75
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

Climbing
behavior
induced
by
apomorphine
was
reduced
in
animals
treated
with
THP
.

Such
an
effect
was
,
however
,
reversed
in
presence
of
RAMH
.

THP
exhibited
an
antipsychotic
-
like
profile
by
potentiating

haloperidol
-induced

catalepsy
,
reducing

amphetamine
-induced

hyperactivity
and
reducing

apomorphine

-induced
climbing
in
mice
.

Such
effects
of
THP
were
reversed
by

RAMH
indicating
the
involvement
of
histamine
H(3)-receptors
.

Findings
suggest
a
potential
for
H(3)-receptor
antagonists
in
improving
the
refractory
cases
of
schizophrenia
.

Transient
platypnea
-
orthodeoxia
-
like
syndrome
induced
by
propafenone
overdose
in
a
young
woman
with
Ebstein
's
anomaly
.

In
this
report
we
describe
the
case
of
a
37-year
-
old
white
woman
with
Ebstein
's
anomaly
,
who
developed
a
rare
syndrome
called
platypnea
-
orthodeoxia
,
characterized
by
massive
right
-
to
-
left
interatrial
shunting
with
transient
profound
hypoxia
and
cyanosis
.

This
shunt
of
blood
via
a
patent
foramen
ovale
occurred
in
the
presence
of
a
normal
pulmonary
artery
pressure
,
and
was
probably
precipitated
by
a
propafenone
overdose
.

This
drug
caused
biventricular
dysfunction
,
due
to
its
negative
inotropic
effect
,
and
hypotension
,
due
to
its
peripheral
vasodilatory
effect
.

These
effects
gave
rise
to
an
increase
in
the
right
atrial
pressure
and
a
decrease
in
the
left
one
with
a
consequent
stretching
of
the
foramen
ovale
and
the
creation
of
massive
right
-
to
-
left
shunting
.

In
our
case
this
interatrial
shunt
was
very
accurately
detected
at
bubble
contrast
echocardiography
.

A
Phase
II
trial
of
cisplatin
plus
WR-2721

(
amifostine
)
for
metastatic
breast
carcinoma
:
an
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
Study
(
E8188
)
.

BACKGROUND
:

Cisplatin
has
minimal
antitumor
activity
when
used
as
second-
or
third
-
line
treatment
of
metastatic
breast
carcinoma
.

Older
reports
suggest
an
objective
response
rate
of
8
%
when
60
-
120
mg
/
m2
of
cisplatin
is
administered
every
3
-
4
weeks
.

Although
a
dose
-
response
effect
has
been
observed
with
cisplatin
,
the
dose
-
limiting
toxicities
associated
with
cisplatin

(
e.g.
,
nephrotoxicity
,
ototoxicity
,
and
neurotoxicity
)
have
limited
its
use
as
a
treatment
for
breast
carcinoma
.

WR-2721
or
amifostine
initially
was
developed
to
protect
military
personnel
in
the
event
of
nuclear
war
.

Amifostine
subsequently
was
shown
to
protect
normal
tissues
from
the
toxic
effects
of
alkylating
agents
and
cisplatin
without
decreasing
the
antitumor
effect
of
the
chemotherapy
.

Early
trials
of
cisplatin
and
amifostine
also
suggested
that
the
incidence
and
severity
of
cisplatin
-induced
nephrotoxicity
,
ototoxicity
,
and
neuropathy
were
reduced
.

METHODS
:

A
Phase
II
study
of
the
combination
of
cisplatin
plus
amifostine
was
conducted
in
patients
with
progressive
metastatic
breast
carcinoma
who
had
received
one
,
but
not
more
than
one
,
chemotherapy
regimen
for
metastatic
disease
.

Patients
received
amifostine
,
910
mg
/
m2
intravenously
over
15
minutes
.

After
completion
of
the
amifostine
infusion
,
cisplatin
120
mg
/
m2
was
administered
over
30
minutes
.

Intravenous
hydration
and
mannitol
was
administered
before
and
after
cisplatin
.

Treatment
was
administered
every
3
weeks
until
disease
progression
.

RESULTS
:

Forty
-
four
patients
were
enrolled
in
the
study
of
which
7
(
16
%
)
were
ineligible
.

A
median
of
2
cycles
of
therapy
was
administered
to
the
37
eligible
patients
.

Six
partial
responses
were
observed
for
an
overall
response
rate
of
16
%
.

Most
patients
(
57
%
)
stopped
treatment
because
of
disease
progression
.

Neurologic
toxicity
was
reported
in
52
%
of
patients
.

Seven
different
life
-
threatening
toxicities
were
observed
in
patients
while
receiving
treatment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
combination
of
cisplatin
and
amifostine
in
this
study
resulted
in
an
overall
response
rate
of
16
%
.

Neither
a
tumor
-protective
effect
nor
reduced
toxicity
to
normal
tissues
was
observed
with
the
addition
of
amifostine
to
cisplatin
in
this
trial
.

Warfarin
-induced

iliopsoas

hemorrhage
with
subsequent
femoral
nerve
palsy
.

We
present
the
case
of
a
28-year
-
old
man
on
chronic
warfarin
therapy
who
sustained
a
minor
muscle
tear
and
developed
increasing
pain
and
a
flexure
contracture
of
the
right
hip
.

Surgical
exploration
revealed
an
iliopsoas
hematoma
and
femoral
nerve
entrapment
,
resulting
in
a
femoral
nerve
palsy
and
partial
loss
of
quadriceps
functions
.

Anticoagulant
-
induced
femoral
nerve
palsy
represents
the
most
common
form
of
warfarin

-induced

peripheral
neuropathy
;
it
is
characterized
by
severe
pain
in
the
inguinal
region
,
varying
degrees
of
motor
and
sensory
impairment
,
and
flexure
contracture
of
the
involved
extremity
.

Myasthenia
gravis
caused
by
penicillamine
and
chloroquine
therapy
for
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

We
have
described
a
unique
patient
who
had
reversible
and
dose
-
related
myasthenia
gravis
after
penicillamine
and
chloroquine
therapy
for
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Although
acetylcholine
receptor
antibodies
were
not
detectable
,
the
time
course
was
consistent
with
an
autoimmune
process
.

Nephrotoxicity
of
combined
cephalothin
-
gentamicin
regimen
.

Two
patients
developed
acute
tubular
necrosis
,
characterized
clinically
by
acute
oliguric
renal
failure
,
while
they
were
receiving
a
combination
of
cephalothin
sodium
and
gentamicin
sulfate
therapy
.

Patients
who
are
given
this
drug
regimen
should
be
observed
very
carefully
for
early
signs
of
nephrotoxicity
.

High
doses
of
this
antibiotic
combination
should
be
avoided
especially
in
elderly
patients
.

Patients
with
renal
insufficiency
should
not
be
given
this
regimen
.

Components
of
lemon
essential
oil
attenuate

dementia
induced
by
scopolamine
.

The
anti-
dementia
effects
of
s
-
limonene
and
s
-
perillyl
alcohol
were
observed
using
the
passive
avoidance
test
(
PA
)
and
the
open
field
habituation
test
(
OFH
)
.

These
lemon
essential
oils
showed
strong
ability
to
improve
memory
impaired
by
scopolamine
;
however
,
s
-
perillyl
alcohol
relieved
the
deficit
of
associative
memory
in
PA
only
,
and
did
not
improve
non
-
associative
memory
significantly
in
OFH
.

Analysis
of
neurotransmitter
concentration
in
some
brain
regions
on
the
test
day
showed
that
dopamine
concentration
of
the
vehicle/
scopolamine
group
was
significantly
lower
than
that
of
the
vehicle
/
vehicle
group
,
but
this
phenomenon
was
reversed
when
s
-
limonene
or
s
-
perillyl
alcohol
were
administered
before
the
injection
of
scopolamine
.

Simultaneously
,
we
found
that
these
two
lemon
essential
oil
components
could
inhibit
acetylcholinesterase
activity
in
vitro
using
the
Ellman
method
.

The
selective
5-HT6
receptor
antagonist
Ro4368554
restores
memory
performance
in
cholinergic
and
serotonergic
models
of
memory
deficiency
in
the
rat
.

Antagonists
at
serotonin
type
6
(
5-HT
(
6
)
)

receptors
show
activity
in
models
of
learning
and
memory
.

Although
the
underlying
mechanism(s
)
are
not
well
understood
,
these
effects
may
involve
an
increase
in
acetylcholine

(
ACh
)
levels
.

The
present
study
sought
to
characterize
the
cognitive
-
enhancing
effects
of
the
5-HT
(
6
)
antagonist
Ro4368554

(
3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl
-
piperazin-1-yl)1H
-
indole
)
in
a
rat
object
recognition
task
employing
a
cholinergic
(
scopolamine
pretreatment
)
and
a
serotonergic-
(
tryptophan
(
TRP
)
depletion
)
deficient
model
,
and
compared
its
pattern
of
action
with
that
of
the
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor
metrifonate
.

Initial
testing
in
a
time
-
dependent
forgetting
task
employing
a
24-h
delay
between
training
and
testing
showed
that
metrifonate
improved
object
recognition
(
at
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
,
p.o
.
)
,
whereas
Ro4368554
was
inactive
.

Both
,
Ro4368554

(
3
and
10
mg
/
kg
,
intraperitoneally
(
i.p
.
)
)
and
metrifonate
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
p.o
.
,
respectively
)
reversed

memory
deficits
induced
by
scopolamine
and
TRP
depletion
(
10
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
,
and
3
mg
/
kg
,
p.o
.
,
respectively
)
.

In
conclusion
,
although
Ro4368554
did
not
improve
a
time
-
related
retention
deficit
,
it
reversed
a
cholinergic
and
a
serotonergic
memory
deficit
,
suggesting
that
both
mechanisms
may
be
involved
in
the
facilitation
of
object
memory
by
Ro4368554
and
,
possibly
,
other
5-HT
(
6
)
receptor
antagonists
.

Lone
atrial
fibrillation
associated
with
creatine

monohydrate
supplementation
.

Atrial
fibrillation
in
young
patients
without
structural
heart
disease
is
rare
.

Therefore
,
when
the
arrhythmia
is
present
in
this
population
,
reversible
causes
must
be
identified
and
resolved
.

Thyroid
disorders
,
illicit
drug
or
stimulant
use
,
and
acute
alcohol
intoxication
are
among
these
causes
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
30-year
-
old
Caucasian
man
who
came
to
the
emergency
department
in
atrial
fibrillation
with
rapid
ventricular
response
.

His
medical
history
was
unremarkable
,
except
for
minor
fractures
of
the
fingers
and
foot
.

Thyroid
-
stimulating
hormone
,
magnesium
,
and
potassium
levels
were
within
normal
limits
,
urine
drug
screen
was
negative
,
and
alcohol
use
was
denied
.

However
,
when
the
patient
was
questioned
about
use
of
herbal
products
and
supplements
,
the
use
of
creatine
monohydrate
was
revealed
.

The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
,
anticoagulated
with
unfractionated
heparin
,
and
given
intravenous
diltiazem
for
rate
control
and
intravenous
amiodarone
for
rate
and
rhythm
control
.

When
discharged
less
than
24
hours
later
,
he
was
receiving
metoprolol
and
aspirin
,
with
follow
-
up
plans
for
echocardiography
and
nuclear
imaging
to
assess
perfusion
.

Exogenous
creatine
is
used
by
athletes
to
theoretically
improve
exercise
performance
.

Vegetarians
may
also
take
creatine
to
replace
what
they
are
not
consuming
from
meat
,
fish
,
and
other
animal
products
.

Previous
anecdotal
reports
have
linked
creatine
to
the
development
of
arrhythmia
.

Clinicians
must
be
diligent
when
interviewing
patients
about
their
drug
therapy
histories
and
include
questions
about
their
use
of
herbal
products
and
dietary
supplements
.

In
addition
,
it
is
important
to
report
adverse
effects
associated
with
frequently
consumed
supplements
and
herbal
products
to
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
in
the
literature
.

Comparison
of
developmental
toxicity
of
selective
and
non
-
selective
cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitors
in
CRL:(WI)WUBR
Wistar
rats--
DFU
and
piroxicam
study
.

BACKGROUND
:

Cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
inhibitors
are
one
of
the
most
often
ingested
drugs
during
pregnancy
.

Unlike
general
toxicity
data
,
their
prenatal
toxic
effects
were
not
extensively
studied
before
.

The
aim
of
the
experiment
was
to
evaluate
the
developmental
toxicity
of
the
non
-
selective
(
piroxicam
)
and
selective
(
DFU
;
5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl
)
phenyl-2(5H)-furanon
)
COX-2
inhibitors
.

METHODS
:

Drugs
were
separately
,
orally
once
daily
dosed
to
pregnant
rats
from
day
8
to
21
(
GD1=plug

.

Doses
were
set
at
0.3
,
3.0
and
30.0mg
/
kg
for
piroxicam
and
0.2
,
2.0
and
20.0mg
/
kg
for
DFU
.

Fetuses
were
delivered
on
GD
21
and
routinely
examined
.

Comprehensive
clinical
and
developmental
measurements
were
done
.

The
pooled
statistical
analysis
for
ventricular
septal
(
VSD
)
and
midline
(
MD
)
defects
was
performed
for
rat
fetuses
exposed
to
piroxicam
,
selective
and
non
-
selective
COX-2
inhibitor
based
on
present
and
historic
data
.

RESULTS
:

Maternal
toxicity
,
intrauterine
growth
retardation
,
and
increase
of
external
and
skeletal
variations
were
found
in
rats
treated
with
the
highest
dose
of
piroxicam
.

Decrease
of
fetal
length
was
the
only
signs
of
the
DFU
developmental
toxicity
observed
in
pups
exposed
to
the
highest
compound
dose
.

Lack
of
teratogenicity
was
found
in
piroxicam
and
DFU
-exposed
groups
.

Prenatal
exposure
to
non
-
selective
COX
inhibitors
increases
the
risk
of
VSD
and
MD
when
compared
to
historic
control
but
not
with
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
.

CONCLUSION
:

Both
selective
and
non
-
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
were
toxic
for
rats
fetuses
when
administered
in
the
highest
dose
.

Unlike
DFU
,
piroxicam
was
also
highly
toxic
to
the
dams
.

Prenatal
exposure
to
selective
COX-2
inhibitors
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
ventricular
septal
and
midline
defects
in
rat
when
compared
to
non
-
selective
drugs
and
historic
control
.

Protective
efficacy
of
neuroactive
steroids
against
cocaine
kindled-
seizures
in
mice
.

Neuroactive
steroids
demonstrate
pharmacological
actions
that
have
relevance
for
a
host
of
neurological
and
psychiatric
disorders
.

They
offer
protection
against
seizures
in
a
range
of
models
and
seem
to
inhibit
certain
stages
of
drug
dependence
in
preclinical
assessments
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
two
endogenous
and
one
synthetic
neuroactive

steroid
that
positively
modulate
the
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid

(
GABA
(
A
)
)
receptor
against
the
increase
in
sensitivity
to
the
convulsant
effects
of
cocaine
engendered
by
repeated
cocaine
administration
(
seizure
kindling
)
.

Allopregnanolone

(
3alpha
-
hydroxy-5alpha
-
pregnan-20-one
)
,
pregnanolone

(
3alpha
-
hydroxy-5beta
-
pregnan-20-one
)
and
ganaxolone
(
a
synthetic
derivative
of
allopregnanolone
3alpha
-
hydroxy-3beta
-
methyl-5alpha
-
pregnan-20-one
)
were
tested
for
their
ability
to
suppress
the
expression
(
anticonvulsant
effect
)
and
development
(
antiepileptogenic
effect
)
of
cocaine
-kindled

seizures
in
male
,
Swiss
-
Webster
mice
.

Kindled
seizures
were
induced
by
daily
administration
of
60
mg
/
kg

cocaine
for
5
days
.

All
of
these
positive
GABA
(
A
)
modulators
suppressed
the
expression
of
kindled
seizures
,
whereas
only
allopregnanolone
and
ganaxolone
inhibited
the
development
of
kindling
.

Allopregnanolone
and
pregnanolone
,
but
not
ganaxolone
,
also
reduced
cumulative
lethality
associated
with
kindling
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
some
neuroactive
steroids
attenuate
convulsant
and
sensitizing
properties
of
cocaine
and
add
to
a
growing
literature
on
their
potential
use
in
the
modulation
of
effects
of
drugs
of
abuse
.

Kidney
function
and
morphology
after
short
-
term
combination
therapy
with
cyclosporine
A
,
tacrolimus
and
sirolimus
in
the
rat
.

BACKGROUND
:

Sirolimus

(
SRL
)
may
supplement
calcineurin
inhibitors
in
clinical
organ
transplantation
.

These
are
nephrotoxic
,
but
SRL
seems
to
act
differently
displaying
only
minor
nephrotoxic
effects
,
although
this
question
is
still
open
.

In
a
number
of
treatment
protocols
where
SRL
was
combined
with
a
calcineurin
inhibitor
indications
of
a
synergistic
nephrotoxic
effect
were
described
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
further
the
renal
function
,
including
morphological
analysis
of
the
kidneys
of
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
treated
with
either
cyclosporine
A

(
CsA
)
,
tacrolimus

(
FK506
)
or
SRL
as
monotherapies
or
in
different
combinations
.

METHODS
:

For
a
period
of
2
weeks
,
CsA
15
mg
/
kg
/
day
(
given
orally
)
,
FK506
3.0
mg
/
kg
/
day
(
given
orally
)
or
SRL
0.4
mg
/
kg
/
day
(
given
intraperitoneally
)
was
administered
once
a
day
as
these
doses
have
earlier
been
found
to
achieve
a
significant
immunosuppressive
effect
in
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
.

In
the
'
conscious
catheterized
rat
'
model
,
the
glomerular
filtration
rate
(
GFR
)
was
measured
as
the
clearance
of
Cr(EDTA
)
.

The
morphological
analysis
of
the
kidneys
included
a
semi
-
quantitative
scoring
system
analysing
the
degree
of
striped
fibrosis
,
subcapsular
fibrosis
and
the
number
of
basophilic
tubules
,
plus
an
additional
stereological
analysis
of
the
total
grade
of
fibrosis
in
the
cortex
stained
with
Sirius
Red
.

RESULTS
:

CsA
,

FK506
and
SRL
all
significantly
decreased
the
GFR
.

A
further
deterioration
was
seen
when
CsA
was
combined
with
either
FK506
or
SRL
,
whereas
the
GFR
remained
unchanged
in
the
group
treated
with
FK506
plus
SRL
when
compared
with
treatment
with
any
of
the
single
substances
.

The
morphological
changes
presented
a
similar
pattern
.

The
semi
-
quantitative
scoring
was
significantly
worst
in
the
group
treated
with
CsA
plus
SRL

(
P<0.001
compared
with
controls
)
and
the
analysis
of
the
total
grade
of
fibrosis
also
showed
the
highest
proportion
in
the
same
group
and
was
significantly
different
from
controls
(
P<0.02
)
.

The
FK506
plus
SRL
combination
showed
only
a
marginally
higher
degree
of
fibrosis
as
compared
with
controls
(
P=0.05
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
rat
study
demonstrated
a
synergistic
nephrotoxic
effect
of
CsA
plus
SRL
,
whereas
FK506
plus
SRL
was
better
tolerated
.

Effect
of

fucoidan
treatment
on
collagenase
-
induced
intracerebral
hemorrhage
in
rats
.

Inflammatory
cells
are
postulated
to
mediate
some
of
the
brain
damage
following
ischemic
stroke
.

Intracerebral
hemorrhage
is
associated
with
more
inflammation
than
ischemic
stroke
.

We
tested
the
sulfated
polysaccharide
fucoidan
,
which
has
been
reported
to
reduce
inflammatory
brain
damage
,
in
a
rat
model
of
intracerebral
hemorrhage
induced
by
injection
of
bacterial
collagenase
into
the
caudate
nucleus
.

Rats
were
treated
with
seven
day
intravenous
infusion
of
fucoidan

(
30
micrograms
h-1
)
or
vehicle
.

The
hematoma
was
assessed
in
vivo
by
magnetic
resonance
imaging
.

Motor
behavior
,
passive
avoidance
,
and
skilled
forelimb
function
were
tested
repeatedly
for
six
weeks
.

Fucoidan

-treated
rats
exhibited
evidence
of
impaired
blood
clotting
and
hemodilution
,
had
larger
hematomas
,
and
tended
to
have
less
inflammation
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hematoma
after
three
days
.

They
showed
significantly
more
rapid
improvement
of
motor
function
in
the
first
week
following
hemorrhage
and
better
memory
retention
in
the
passive
avoidance
test
.

Acute
white
matter
edema
and
eventual
neuronal
loss
in
the
striatum
adjacent
to
the
hematoma
did
not
differ
between
the
two
groups
.

Investigation
of
more
specific
anti
-
inflammatory
agents
and
hemodiluting
agents
are
warranted
in
intracerebral
hemorrhage
.

Paracetamol
-associated
coma
,
metabolic
acidosis
,
renal
and
hepatic
failure
.

A
case
of
metabolic
acidosis
,
acute
renal
failure
and
hepatic
failure
following
paracetamol
ingestion
is
presented
.

The
diagnostic
difficulty
at
presentation
is
highlighted
.

Continuous
arteriovenous
haemofiltration
proved
a
valuable
means
of
maintaining
fluid
and
electrolyte
balance
.

The
patient
recovered
.

Hepatic
reactions
associated
with
ketoconazole
in
the
United
Kingdom
.

Ketoconazole
was
introduced
in
the
United
Kingdom
in
1981
.

By
November
1984
the
Committee
on
Safety
of
Medicines
had
received
82
reports
of
possible
hepatotoxicity
associated
with
the
drug
,
including
five
deaths
.

An
analysis
of
the
75
cases
that
had
been
adequately
followed
up
suggested
that
16
,
including
three
deaths
,
were
probably
related
to
treatment
with
the
drug
.

Of
the
remainder
,
48
were
possibly
related
to
treatment
,
five
were
unlikely
to
be
so
,
and
six
were
unclassifiable
.

The
mean
age
of
patients
in
the
16
probable
cases
was
57.9
,
with
hepatotoxicity
being
more
common
in
women
.

The
average
duration
of
treatment
before
the
onset
of
jaundice
was
61
days
.

None
of
these
well
validated
cases
occurred
within
the
first
10
days
after
treatment
.

The
results
of
serum
liver
function
tests
suggested

hepatocellular
injury
in
10
(
63
%
)
;
the
rest
showed
a
mixed
pattern
.

In
contrast
,
the
results
of
histological
examination
of
the
liver
often
showed
evidence
of
cholestasis
.

The
characteristics
of
the
48
patients
in
the
possible
cases
were
similar
.

Allergic
manifestations
such
as
rash
and
eosinophilia
were
rare
.

Hepatitis
was
usually
reversible
when
treatment
was
stopped
,
with
the
results
of
liver
function
tests
returning
to
normal
after
an
average
of
3.1
months
.

In
two
of
the
three
deaths
probably
associated
with
ketoconazole
treatment
the
drug
had
been
continued
after
the
onset
of
jaundice
and
other
symptoms
of
hepatitis
.

Clinical
and
biochemical
monitoring
at
regular
intervals
for
evidence
of
hepatitis
is
advised
during
long
term
treatment
with
ketoconazole
to
prevent
possible
serious
hepatic
injury
.

Combined
effects
of
prolonged
prostaglandin
E1
-induced

hypotension
and
haemodilution
on
human
hepatic
function
.

Combined
effects
of
prolonged
prostaglandin
E1

(
PGE1
)
-induced

hypotension
and
haemodilution
on
hepatic
function
were
studied
in
30
patients
undergoing
hip
surgery
.

The
patients
were
randomly
allocated
to
one
of
three
groups
;
those
in
group
A
(
n
=
10
)
were
subjected
to
controlled
hypotension
alone
,
those
in
group
B
(
n
=
10
)
to
haemodilution
alone
and
those
in
group
C
(
n
=
10
)
to
both
controlled
hypotension
and
haemodilution
.

Haemodilution
in
groups
B
and
C
was
produced
by
withdrawing
approximately
1000
mL
of
blood
and
replacing
it
with
the
same
amount
of
dextran
solution
,
and
final
haematocrit
values
were
21
or
22
%
.

Controlled
hypotension
in
groups
A
and
C
was
induced
with
PGE1
to
maintain
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
at
55
mmHg
for
180
min
.

Measurements
included
arterial
ketone
body
ratio
(
AKBR
,
aceto
-
acetate
/
3-hydroxybutyrate
)
and
clinical
hepatic
function
parameters
.

AKBR
and
biological
hepatic
function
tests
showed
no
change
throughout
the
time
course
in
groups
A
and
B.
In
group
C
,
AKBR
showed
a
significant
decrease
at
120
min
(
-40
%
)
and
at
180
min
(
-49
%
)
after
the
start
of
hypotension
and
at
60
min
(
-32
%
)
after
recovery
of
normotension
,
and
SGOT
,
SGPT
,
LDH
and
total

bilirubin
showed
significant
increases
after
operation
.

The
results
suggest
that
a
prolonged
combination
of
more
than
120
min
of
PGE1
-induced
hypotension
and
moderate
haemodilution
would
cause
impairment
of
hepatic
function
.

Levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease
:
filling
the
bench
-
to
-
bedside
gap
.

Levodopa
is
the
most
effective
drug
for
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

However
,
the
long
-
term
use
of
this
dopamine
precursor
is
complicated
by
highly
disabling
fluctuations
and
dyskinesias
.

Although
preclinical
and
clinical
findings
suggest
pulsatile
stimulation
of
striatal
postsynaptic
receptors
as
a
key
mechanism
underlying
levodopa

-induced

dyskinesias
,
their
pathogenesis
is
still
unclear
.

In
recent
years
,
evidence
from
animal
models
of
Parkinson
's
disease
has
provided
important
information
to
understand
the
effect
of
specific
receptor
and
post
-
receptor
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
development
of
dyskinetic
movements
.

Recent
preclinical
and
clinical
data
from
promising
lines
of
research
focus
on
the
differential
role
of
presynaptic
versus
postsynaptic
mechanisms
,
dopamine
receptor
subtypes
,
ionotropic
and
metabotropic
glutamate
receptors
,
and
non
-
dopaminergic
neurotransmitter
systems
in
the
pathophysiology
of
levodopa

-induced

dyskinesias
.

Prevention
of
seizures
and
reorganization
of
hippocampal
functions
by
transplantation
of
bone
marrow
cells
in
the
acute
phase
of
experimental
epilepsy
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
therapeutic
potential
of
bone
marrow
mononuclear
cells
(
BMCs
)
in
a
model
of
epilepsy
induced
by
pilocarpine
in
rats
.

BMCs
obtained
from
green
fluorescent
protein
(
GFP
)
transgenic
mice
or
rats
were
transplanted
intravenously
after
induction
of
status
epilepticus

(
SE
)
.

Spontaneous
recurrent
seizures

(
SRS
)
were
monitored
using
Racine
's
seizure
severity
scale
.

All
of
the
rats
in
the
saline
-
treated
epileptic
control
group
developed
SRS
,
whereas
none
of
the
BMC
-
treated
epileptic
animals
had
seizures
in
the
short
term
(
15
days
after
transplantation
)
,
regardless
of
the
BMC
source
.

Over
the
long
-
term
chronic
phase
(
120
days
after
transplantation
)
,
only
25
%
of
BMC
-
treated
epileptic
animals
had
seizures
,
but
with
a
lower
frequency
and
duration
compared
to
the
epileptic
control
group
.

The
density
of
hippocampal
neurons
in
the
brains
of
animals
treated
with
BMCs
was
markedly
preserved
.

At
hippocampal
Schaeffer
collateral
-
CA1
synapses
,
long
-
term
potentiation
was
preserved
in
BMC
-
transplanted
rats
compared
to
epileptic
controls
.

The
donor
-
derived
GFP(+
)
cells
were
rarely
found
in
the
brains
of
transplanted
epileptic
rats
.

In
conclusion
,
treatment
with
BMCs
can
prevent
the
development
of
chronic
seizures
,
reduce
neuronal
loss
,
and
influence
the
reorganization
of
the
hippocampal
neuronal
network
.

Cardioprotective
effect
of
salvianolic
acid
A
on
isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
infarction
in
rats
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
cardioprotective
potential
of
salvianolic
acid
A
on
isoproterenol
-induced
myocardial
infarction
in
rats
.

Hemodynamic
parameters
and
lead
II
electrocardiograph
were
monitored
and
recorded
continuously
.

Cardiac
marker
enzymes
and
antioxidative
parameters
in
serum
and
heart
tissues
were
measured
.

Assay
for
mitochondrial
respiratory
function
and
histopathological
examination
of
heart
tissues
were
performed
.

Isoproterenol

-treated
rats
showed
significant
increases
in
the
levels
of
lactate
dehydrogenase
,
aspartate
transaminase
,
creatine
kinase
and
malondialdehyde
and
significant
decreases
in
the
activities
of
superoxide
dismutase
,
catalase
and
glutathione
peroxidase
in
serum
and
heart
.

These
rats
also
showed
declines
in
left
ventricular
systolic
pressure
,
maximum
and
minimum
rate
of
developed
left
ventricular
pressure
,
and
elevation
of
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
pressure
and
ST
-
segment
.

In
addition
,
mitochondrial
respiratory
dysfunction
characterized
by
decreased
respiratory
control
ratio
and
ADP
/O
was
observed
in
isoproterenol
-treated
rats
.

Administration
of
salvianolic
acid
A
for
a
period
of
8
days
significantly
attenuated
isoproterenol

-induced

cardiac
dysfunction
and
myocardial
injury
and
improved
mitochondrial
respiratory
function
.

The
protective
role
of
salvianolic
acid
A
against

isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
damage
was
further
confirmed
by
histopathological
examination
.

The
results
of
our
study
suggest
that
salvianolic
acid
A

possessing
antioxidant
activity
has
a
significant
protective
effect
against
isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
infarction
.

Acute
effects
of
N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea
on
hippocampal
amino
acid
neurotransmitters
in
pilocarpine
-induced
seizure
in
rats
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
investigate
the
anticonvulsant
activity
as
well
as
the
effects
on
the
level
of
hippocampal
amino
acid
neurotransmitters
(
glutamate
,
aspartate
,
glycine
and
GABA
)
of
N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea

(
VPU
)
in
comparison
to
its
parent
compound
,
valproic
acid

(
VPA
)
.

VPU
was
more
potent
than
VPA
,
exhibiting
the
median
effective
dose
(
ED(50
)
)
of
49
mg
/
kg
in
protecting
rats
against

pilocarpine
-induced

seizure

whereas
the
corresponding
value
for
VPA
was
322
mg
/
kg
.

In
vivo
microdialysis
demonstrated
that
an
intraperitoneal
administration
of
pilocarpine
induced
a
pronounced
increment
of
hippocampal
glutamate
and
aspartate
whereas
no
significant
change
was
observed
on
the
level
of
glycine
and
GABA
.

Pretreatment
with
either
VPU

(
50
and
100
mg
/
kg
)
or
VPA

(
300
and
600
mg
/
kg
)
completely
abolished

pilocarpine

-evoked
increases
in
extracellular
glutamate
and
aspartate
.

In
addition
,
a
statistically
significant
reduction
was
also
observed
on
the
level
of
GABA
and
glycine
but
less
than
a
drastic
reduction
of
glutamate
and
aspartate
level
.

Based
on
the
finding
that
VPU
and
VPA
could
protect
the
animals
against
pilocarpine
-induced

seizure

it
is
suggested
that
the
reduction
of
inhibitory
amino
acid
neurotransmitters
was
comparatively
minor
and
offset
by
a
pronounced
reduction
of
glutamate
and
aspartate
.

Therefore
,
like
VPA
,
the
finding
that
VPU
could
drastically
reduce

pilocarpine
-induced
increases
in
glutamate
and
aspartate
should
account
,
at
least
partly
,
for
its
anticonvulsant
activity
observed
in
pilocarpine
-induced
seizure
in
experimental
animals
.

Some
other
mechanism
than
those
being
reported
herein
should
be
further
investigated
.

Acute
hepatitis
attack
after
exposure
to
telithromycin
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Antibiotic
-
associated

hepatotoxicity
is
rare
.

With
widespread
use
of
antimicrobial
agents
,
however
,
hepatic
injury
occurs
frequently
,
and
among
adverse
drug
reactions
,
idiosyncratic
reactions
are
the
most
serious
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
25-year
-
old
male
patient
,
with
a
height
of
175
cm
and
weight
of
72
kg
presented
to
Marmara
University
Hospital
Emergency
Department
,
Istanbul
,
Turkey
,
with
5
days
'
history
of
jaundice
,
malaise
,
nausea
,
and
vomiting
.

He
had
been
prescribed
telithromycin
400
mg
/

d
PO
to
treat
an
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
7
days
prior
.

Admission
laboratory
tests
were
as
follows
:

alanine
aminotransferase
,
67
U
/

,
10
-
37
U

)
;
and
albumin
,
4.7
mg
/
dL
(
3.5
-
5.4
mg
/
dL
)
.

No
toxin
,
alcohol
,
or
other
drugs
were
reported
.

The
patient
had
suffered
a
previous
episode
of
"
acute
hepatitis
of
unknown
origin
,
"
that
occurred
after
telithromycin
usage
.

Both
incidents
occurred
within
a
year
.

DISCUSSION
:

Telithromycin
is
the
first
of
the
ketolide
antibacterials
to
receive
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
approval
for
clinical
use
.

It
has
been
associated
with
infrequent
and
usually
reversible
severe
hepatic
dysfunction
.

Based
on
a
score
of
8
on
the
Naranjo
adverse
drug
reaction
probability
scale
,
telithromycin
was
the
probable
cause
of
acute
hepatitis
in
this
patient
,
and
pathological
findings
suggested
drug
-
induced
toxic
hepatitis
.

Recurrence
of
hepatitis
attack
might
have
been
avoided
if
the
initial
incident
had
been
communicated
to
the
attending
physician
who
prescribed
telithromycin
the
second
time
.

CONCLUSION
:

Here
we
report
a
case
of
acute
hepatitis
probably
associated
with
the
administration
of
telithromycin
.

Spironolactone
-induced
renal
insufficiency
and
hyperkalemia
in
patients
with
heart
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:

A
previous
randomized
controlled
trial
evaluating
the
use
of
spironolactone
in
heart
failure
patients
reported
a
low
risk
of
hyperkalemia

(
2
%
)
and
renal
insufficiency
(
0
%
)
.

Because
treatments
for
heart
failure
have
changed
since
the
benefits
of
spironolactone
were
reported
,
the
prevalence
of
these
complications
may
differ
in
current
clinical
practice
.

We
therefore
sought
to
determine
the
prevalence
and
clinical
associations
of
hyperkalemia
and
renal
insufficiency
in
heart
failure
patients
treated
with
spironolactone
.

METHODS
:
We
performed
a
case
control
study
of
heart
failure
patients
treated
with
spironolactone
in
our
clinical
practice
.

Cases
were
patients
who
developed
hyperkalemia

(
K
(
+
)

>
5.0
mEq
/
L
)
or
renal
insufficiency

(
Cr
>
or=2.5
mg
/
dL
)
,
and
they
were
compared
to
2
randomly
selected
controls
per
case
.

Clinical
characteristics
,
medications
,
and
serum
chemistries
at
baseline
and
follow
-
up
time
periods
were
compared
.

RESULTS
:

Sixty
-
seven
of
926
patients
(
7.2
%
)
required
discontinuation
of
spironolactone
due
to
hyperkalemia

(
n
=
33
)
or
renal
failure
(
n
=
34
)
.

Patients
who
developed
hyperkalemia
were
older
and
more
likely
to
have
diabetes
,
had
higher
baseline
serum

potassium
levels
and
lower
baseline
potassium
supplement
doses
,
and
were
more
likely
to
be
treated
with
beta
-
blockers
than
controls
(
n
=
134
)
.

Patients
who
developed
renal
insufficiency
had
lower
baseline
body
weight
and
higher
baseline
serum
creatinine
,
required
higher
doses
of
loop
diuretics
,
and
were
more
likely
to
be
treated
with
thiazide
diuretics
than
controls
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Spironolactone
-induced

hyperkalemia
and
renal
insufficiency
are
more
common
in
our
clinical
experience
than
reported
previously
.

This
difference
is
explained
by
patient
comorbidities
and
more
frequent
use
of
beta
-
blockers
.

End
-
stage
renal
disease
(
ESRD
)
after
orthotopic
liver
transplantation
(
OLTX
)
using
calcineurin
-
based
immunotherapy
:
risk
of
development
and
treatment
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
calcineurin
inhibitors
cyclosporine
and
tacrolimus
are
both
known
to
be
nephrotoxic
.

Their
use
in
orthotopic
liver
transplantation
(
OLTX
)
has
dramatically
improved
success
rates
.

Recently
,
however
,
we
have
had
an
increase
of
patients
who
are
presenting
after
OLTX
with
end
-
stage
renal
disease

(
ESRD
)
.

This
retrospective
study
examines
the
incidence
and
treatment
of
ESRD
and
chronic
renal
failure

(
CRF
)
in
OLTX
patients
.

METHODS
:

Patients
receiving
an
OLTX
only
from
June
1985
through
December
of
1994
who
survived
6
months
postoperatively
were
studied
(
n=834
)
.

Our
prospectively
collected
database
was
the
source
of
information
.

Patients
were
divided
into
three
groups
:
Controls
,
no
CRF
or
ESRD

,
n=748
;
CRF
,

sustained
serum
creatinine
>
2.5
mg
/
dl
,
n=41
;
and
ESRD
,
n=45
.

Groups
were
compared
for
preoperative
laboratory
variables
,
diagnosis
,
postoperative
variables
,
survival
,
type
of
ESRD
therapy
,
and
survival
from
onset
of
ESRD
.

RESULTS
:

At
13
years
after
OLTX
,
the
incidence
of
severe
renal
dysfunction
was
18.1
%
(

CRF
8.6
%
and

ESRD
9.5
%
)
.

Compared
with
control
patients
,
CRF
and
ESRD
patients
had
higher
preoperative
serum
creatinine
levels
,
a
greater
percentage
of
patients
with
hepatorenal
syndrome
,
higher
percentage
requirement
for
dialysis
in
the
first
3
months
postoperatively
,
and
a
higher
1-year
serum
creatinine
.

Multivariate
stepwise
logistic
regression
analysis
using
preoperative
and
postoperative
variables
identified
that
an
increase
of
serum
creatinine
compared
with
average
at
1
year
,
3
months
,
and
4
weeks
postoperatively
were
independent
risk
factors
for
the
development
of
CRF
or
ESRD
with
odds
ratios
of
2.6
,
2.2
,
and
1.6
,
respectively
.

Overall
survival
from
the
time
of
OLTX
was
not
significantly
different
among
groups
,
but
by
year
13
,
the
survival
of
the
patients
who
had
ESRD
was
only
28.2
%
compared
with
54.6
%
in
the
control
group
.

Patients
developing
ESRD
had
a
6-year
survival
after
onset
of
ESRD
of
27
%
for
the
patients
receiving
hemodialysis
versus
71.4
%
for
the
patients
developing
ESRD
who
subsequently
received
kidney
transplants
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Patients
who
are
more
than
10
years
post
-
OLTX
have
CRF
and
ESRD
at
a
high
rate
.

The
development
of
ESRD
decreases
survival
,
particularly
in
those
patients
treated
with
dialysis
only
.

Patients
who
develop
ESRD
have
a
higher
preoperative
and
1-year
serum
creatinine
and
are
more
likely
to
have
hepatorenal
syndrome
.

However
,
an
increase
of
serum
creatinine
at
various
times
postoperatively
is
more
predictive
of
the
development
of
CRF
or
ESRD
.

New
strategies
for
long
-
term
immunosuppression
may
be
needed
to
decrease
this
complication
.

Effect
of
intravenous
nimodipine
on
blood
pressure
and
outcome
after
acute
stroke
.

BACKGROUND
AND
PURPOSE
:

The
Intravenous
Nimodipine
West
European
Stroke
Trial
(
INWEST
)
found
a
correlation
between
nimodipine
-induced
reduction
in
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
and
an
unfavorable
outcome
in
acute
stroke
.

We
sought
to
confirm
this
correlation
with
and
without
adjustment
for
prognostic
variables
and
to
investigate
outcome
in
subgroups
with
increasing
levels
of
BP
reduction
.

METHODS
:

Patients
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
ischemic
stroke

(
within
24
hours
)
were
consecutively
allocated
to
receive
placebo
(
n=100
)
,
1
mg
/
h
(
low
-
dose
)
nimodipine

(
n=101
)
,
or
2
mg
/
h
(
high
-
dose
)
nimodipine

(
n=94
)
.

The
correlation
between
average
BP
change
during
the
first
2
days
and
the
outcome
at
day
21
was
analyzed
.

RESULTS
:

Two
hundred
sixty
-
five
patients
were
included
in
this
analysis
(
n=92
,
93
,
and
80
for
placebo
,
low
dose
,
and
high
dose
,
respectively
)
.

Nimodipine
treatment
resulted
in
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
systolic
BP

(
SBP
)
and
diastolic
BP
(
DBP
)
from
baseline
compared
with
placebo
during
the
first
few
days
.

In
multivariate
analysis
,
a
significant
correlation
between
DBP
reduction
and
worsening
of
the
neurological
score
was
found
for
the
high
-
dose
group
(
beta=0.49
,
P=0
.
048
)
.

Patients
with
a
DBP
reduction
of
>
or
=
20
%
in
the
high
-
dose
group
had
a
significantly
increased
adjusted
OR
for
the
compound

compared
with
all
placebo
patients
(

N=62/92
and
14/92
,
respectively
)
.

There
was
no
correlation
between
SBP
change
and
outcome
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

DBP
,
but
not
SBP
,
reduction
was
associated
with
neurological
worsening
after
the
intravenous
administration
of
high
-
dose
nimodipine
after
acute
stroke
.

For
low
-
dose
nimodipine
,
the
results
were
not
conclusive
.

These
results
do
not
confirm
or
exclude
a
neuroprotective
property
of
nimodipine
.

Transient
neurologic
symptoms
after
spinal
anesthesia
:
a
lower
incidence
with
prilocaine
and
bupivacaine
than
with
lidocaine
.

BACKGROUND
:

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
transient
neurologic
symptoms

(
TNSs
)
frequently
follow
lidocaine
spinal
anesthesia
but
are
infrequent
with
bupivacaine
.

However
,
identification
of
a
short
-
acting
local
anesthetic
to
substitute
for
lidocaine
for
brief
surgical
procedures
remains
an
important
goal
.

Prilocaine
is
an
amide
local
anesthetic
with
a
duration
of
action
similar
to
that
of
lidocaine
.

Accordingly
,
the
present
,
prospective
double
-
blind
study
compares
prilocaine
with
lidocaine
and
bupivacaine
with
respect
to
duration
of
action
and
relative
risk
of
TNSs
.

METHODS
:

Ninety
patients
classified
as
American
Society
of
Anesthesiologists
physical
status

I
or
II
who
were
scheduled
for
short
gynecologic
procedures
under
spinal
anesthesia
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
2.5
ml
2
%
lidocaine
in
7.5
%
glucose
,
2
%
prilocaine
in
7.5
%
glucose
,
or
0.5
%

bupivacaine
in
7.5
%
glucose
.

All
solutions
were
provided
in
blinded
vials
by
the
hospital
pharmacy
.

Details
of
spinal
puncture
,
extension
and
regression
of
spinal
block
,
and
the
times
to
reach
discharge
criteria
were
noted
.

In
the
evening
of
postoperative
day
1
,
patients
were
evaluated
for
TNSs
by
a
physician
unaware
of
the
drug
administered
and
the
details
of
the
anesthetic
procedure
.

RESULTS
:

Nine
of
30
patients
receiving
lidocaine
experienced

TNSs
,
1
of
30
patients
receiving
prilocaine

(
P
=
0.03
)
had
them
,
and
none
of
30
patients
receiving
bupivacaine
had
TNSs
.

Times
to
ambulate
and
to
void
were
similar
after
lidocaine
and
prilocaine

(
150
vs.
165
min
and
238
vs.
253
min
,
respectively
)
but
prolonged
after
bupivacaine
(
200
and
299
min
,
respectively
;
P
0.05
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Prilocaine
may
be
preferable
to
lidocaine
for
short
surgical
procedures
because
it
has
a
similar
duration
of
action
but
a
lower
incidence
of
TNSs
.

The
role
of
nicotine
in
smoking
-
related
cardiovascular
disease
.

Nicotine
activates
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
and
in
this
way
could
contribute
to
cardiovascular
disease
.

Animal
studies
and
mechanistic
studies
indicate
that
nicotine
could
play
a
role
in
accelerating
atherosclerosis
,
but
evidence
among
humans
is
too
inadequate
to
be
definitive
about
such
an
effect
.

Almost
certainly
,
nicotine
via
its
hemodynamic
effects
contributes
to
acute
cardiovascular
events
,
although
current
evidence
suggests
that
the
effects
of
nicotine
are
much
less
important
than
are
the
prothrombotic
effects
of
cigarette
smoking
or
the
effects
of
carbon
monoxide
.

Nicotine
does
not
appear
to
enhance
thrombosis
among
humans
.

Clinical
studies
of
pipe
smokers
and
people
using
transdermal
nicotine
support
the
idea
that
toxins
other
than
nicotine
are
the
most
important
causes
of
acute
cardiovascular
events
.

Finally
,
the
dose
response
for
cardiovascular
events
of
nicotine
appears
to
be
flat
,
suggesting
that
if
nicotine
is
involved
,
adverse
effects
might
be
seen
with
relatively
low
-
level
cigarette
exposures
.

Seizure
resulting
from
a
venlafaxine
overdose
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
venlafaxine
overdose
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
40-year
-
old
woman
with
major
depression
took
an
overdose
of
venlafaxine
in
an
apparent
suicide
attempt
.

After
the
ingestion
of
26
venlafaxine

50-mg
tablets
,
the
patient
experienced
a
witnessed
generalized
seizure
.

She
was
admitted
to
the
medical
intensive
care
unit
,
venlafaxine
was
discontinued
,
and
no
further
sequelae
were
seen
.

DISCUSSION
:

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
reported
case
of
venlafaxine

overdose
that
resulted
in
a
generalized
seizure
.

Based
on
nonoverdose
pharmacokinetics
and
pharmacodynamics
of
venlafaxine
and
the
potential
risks
of
available
interventions
,
no
emergent
therapy
was
instituted
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
venlafaxine

overdose
in
our
patient
resulted
in
a
single
episode
of
generalized
seizure
but
elicited
no
further
sequelae
.

Effect
of
nifedipine
on
renal
function
in
liver
transplant
recipients
receiving
tacrolimus
.

The
effect
of
nifedipine
on
renal
function
in
liver
transplant
recipients
who
were
receiving
tacrolimus
was
evaluated
between
January
1992
and
January
1996
.

Two
groups
of
patients
receiving
tacrolimus
were
compared
over
a
period
of
1
year
,
one
group
comprising
hypertensive
patients
who
were
receiving
nifedipine
,
and
the
other
comprising
nonhypertensive
patients
not
receiving
nifedipine
.

The
time
from
transplant
to
baseline
was
similar
in
all
patients
.

Nifedipine
significantly
improved
kidney
function
as
indicated
by
a
significant
lowering
of
serum
creatinine
levels
at
6
and
12
months
.

The
observed
positive
impact
of
nifedipine
on
reducing
the
nephrotoxicity
associated
with
tacrolimus
in
liver
transplant
recipients
should
be
an
important
factor
in
selecting
an
agent
to
treat
hypertension
in
this
population
.

Sinus
arrest
associated
with
continuous
-
infusion
cimetidine
.

The
administration
of
intermittent
intravenous
infusions
of
cimetidine
is
infrequently
associated
with
the
development
of
bradyarrhythmias
.

A
40-year
-
old
man
with
leukemia
and
no
history
of
cardiac
disease
developed
recurrent
,
brief
episodes
of
apparent
sinus
arrest
while
receiving
continuous
-
infusion
cimetidine
50
mg
/
hour
.

The
arrhythmias
were
temporally
related
to
cimetidine
administration
,
disappeared
after
dechallenge
,
and
did
not
recur
during
ranitidine
treatment
.

This
is
the
first
reported
case
of
sinus
arrest
associated
with
continuous
-
infusion
cimetidine
.

Composition
of
gall
bladder
stones
associated
with
octreotide
:
response
to
oral
ursodeoxycholic
acid
.

Octreotide
,
an
effective
treatment
for
acromegaly
,
induces
gall
bladder
stones
in
13
-
60
%
of
patients
.

Because
knowledge
of
stone
composition
is
essential
for
studies
of
their
pathogenesis
,
treatment
,
and
prevention
,
this
was
investigated
by
direct
and
indirect
methods
in
14
octreotide
treated
acromegalic
patients
with
gall
stones
.

Chemical
analysis
of
gall
stones
retrieved
at
cholecystectomy
from
two
patients
,
showed
that
they
contained
71
%
and
87
%
cholesterol
by
weight
.

In
the
remaining
12
patients
,
localised
computed
tomography
of
the
gall
bladder
showed
that
eight
had
stones
with
maximum
attenuation
scores
of
100
Hounsfield
units
(
values
of
100
HU
predict
cholesterol

rich
,
dissolvable
stones
)
.

Gall
bladder
bile
was
obtained
by
ultrasound
guided
,
fine
needle
puncture
from
six
patients
.

All
six
patients
had
supersaturated
bile
(
mean
(
SEM
)
cholesterol
saturation
index
of
1.19
(
0.08
)
(
range
1.01
-
1.53
)
)
and
all
had
abnormally
rapid
cholesterol

microcrystal
nucleation
times
(
4
days
(
range
1
-
4
)
)
,
whilst
in
four
,
the
bile
contained
cholesterol
microcrystals
immediately
after
sampling
.

Of
the
12
patients
considered
for
oral
ursodeoxycholic
acid

(
UDCA
)
treatment
,
two
had
a
blocked
cystic
duct
and
were
not
started
on
UDCA
while
one
was
lost
to
follow
up
.

After
one
year
of
treatment
,
five
of
the
remaining
nine
patients
showed
either
partial
(
n
=
3
)
or
complete
(
n
=
2
)
gall
stone
dissolution
,
suggesting
that
their
stones
were
cholesterol
rich
.

This
corresponds
,
by
actuarial
(
life
table
)
analysis
,
to
a
combined
gall
stone

dissolution
rate
of
58.3
(
15.9
%
)
.

In
conclusion
,
octreotide
induced

gall
stones
are
generally
small
,
multiple
,
and
cholesterol
rich
although
,
in
common
with
spontaneous
gall
stone
disease
,
at
presentation
some
patients
will
have
a
blocked
cystic
duct
and
some
gall
stones
containing
calcium
.

Cardiovascular
complications
associated
with
terbutaline
treatment
for
preterm
labor
.

Severe
cardiovascular
complications
occurred
in
eight
of
160
patients
treated
with
terbutaline
for
preterm
labor
.

Associated
corticosteroid
therapy
and
twin
gestations
appear
to
be
predisposing
factors
.

Potential
mechanisms
of
the
pathophysiology
are
briefly
discussed
.

Neurologic
effects
of
subarachnoid
administration
of
2-chloroprocaine
-
CE
,
bupivacaine
,
and
low
pH
normal
saline
in
dogs
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
neurologic
consequences
of
deliberate
subarachnoid
injection
of
large
volumes
of
2-chloroprocaine
-
CE
in
experimental
animals
.

The
possible
role
of
low
pH
as
well
as
total
volume
as
potential
factors
in
causing
neurotoxicity
was
evaluated
.

The
65
dogs
in
the
study
received
injections
in
the
subarachnoid
space
as
follows
:
6
to
8
ml
of
bupivacaine

(
N
=
15
)
,
2-chloroprocaine
-
CE
(
N
=
20
)
,
low
pH
normal
saline
(
pH
3.0
)

(
N
=
20
)
,
or
normal
saline
(
N
=
10
)
.

Of
the
20
animals
that
received
subarachnoid
injection
of

2-chloroprocaine
-
CE
seven
(
35
%
)
developed
hind
-
limb
paralysis
.

None
of
the
animals
that
received
bupivacaine
,
normal
saline
,
or
normal
saline
titrated
to
a
pH
3.0
developed
hind
-
limb
paralysis
.

Of
the
15
spinal
cords
of
the
animals
that
received
2-chloroprocaine
-
CE
,
13
showed
subpial
necrosis
;
the
nerve
roots
and
subarachnoid
vessels
were
normal
.

The
spinal
cords
of
the
animals
that
received
bupivacaine
,
low
pH
normal
saline
(
pH
3.0
)
,
or
normal
saline
did
not
show
abnormal
findings
.

Early
adjuvant

adriamycin
in
superficial
bladder
carcinoma
.

A
multicenter
study
was
performed
in
110
patients
with
superficial
transitional
cell
carcinoma
of
the
bladder
.

Adriamycin
(
50
mg/50
ml
)
was
administered
intravesically
within
24
h
after
transurethral
resection
of
TA
-
T1
(
O
-
A
)
bladder
tumors
.

Instillation
was
repeated
twice
during
the
first
week
,
then
weekly
during
the
first
month
and
afterwards
monthly
for
1
year
.

The
tolerance
was
evaluated
in
these
110
patients
,
and
29
patients
presented
with
local
side
-
effects
.

In
24
of
these
patients
chemical
cystitis
was
severe
enough
for
them
to
drop
out
of
the
study
.

No
systemic
side
-
effects
were
observed
.

Recurrence
was
studied
in
82
evaluable
patients
after
1
year
of
follow
-
up
and
in
72
patients
followed
for
2
-
3
years
(
mean
32
months
)
.

Of
the
82
patients
studied
after
1
year
,
23
had
primary
and
59
recurrent
disease
.

Of
the
82
evaluable
patients
,
50
did
not
show
any
recurrence
after
1
year
(
61
%
)
,
while
32
presented
with
one
or
more
recurrences
(
39
%
)
.

Of
these
recurrences
,
27
were
T1

tumors
while
five
progressed
to
more
highly
invasive
lesions
.

In
patients
that
were
free
of
recurrence
during
the
first
year
,
80
%
remained

tumor
-free

during
the
2-
to
3-year
follow
-
up
period
.

Of
the
patients
developing
one
or
more
recurrences
during
the
first
year
,
only
50
%
presented
with
further
recurrence
once
the
instillations
were
stopped
.

The
beneficial
effect
of
Adriamycin
appears
obvious
and
might
be
related
to
the
drug
itself
,
the
early
and
repeated
instillations
after
TUR
,
or
both
.

Hyperkalemia
associated
with
sulindac
therapy
.

Hyperkalemia
has
recently
been
recognized
as
a
complication
of
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
agents
(
NSAID
)
such
as
indomethacin
.

Several
recent
studies
have
stressed
the
renal
sparing
features
of
sulindac
,
owing
to
its
lack
of
interference
with
renal
prostacyclin
synthesis
.

We
describe
4
patients
in
whom
hyperkalemia
ranging
from
6.1
to
6.9
mEq
/
l
developed
within
3
to
8
days
of
sulindac
administration
.

In
all
of
them
normal
serum
potassium
levels
reached
within
2
to
4
days
of
stopping
sulindac
.

As
no
other
medications
known
to
effect
serum
potassium
had
been
given
concomitantly
,
this
course
of
events
is
suggestive
of
a
cause
-
and
-
effect
relationship
between
sulindac
and
hyperkalemia
.

These
observations
indicate
that
initial
hopes
that
sulindac
may
not
be
associated
with
the
adverse
renal
effects
of
other
NSAID
are
probably
not
justified
.

Ventricular
tachyarrhythmias
during
cesarean
section
after
ritodrine
therapy
:
interaction
with
anesthetics
.

This
case
illustrates
that
patients
receiving
ritodrine
for
preterm
labor
may
risk
interactions
between
the
residual
betamimetic
effects
of
ritodrine
and
the
effects
of
anesthetics
during
cesarean
section
.

Such
interactions
may
result
in
serious
cardiovascular
complications
even
after
cessation
of
an
infusion
of
ritodrine
.

Preoperative
assessment
should
focus
on
cardiovascular
status
and
serum
potassium
level
.

Delaying
induction
of
anesthesia
should
be
considered
whenever
possible
.

Careful
fluid
administration
and
cautious
use
of
titrated
doses
of
ephedrine
are
advised
.

After
delivery
of
the
infant
,
there
should
be
no
contraindication
to
the
use
of
an
alpha
-
adrenergic
vasopressor
such
as
phenylephrine
to
treat
hypotensive
patients
with
tachycardia
.

Immunohistochemical
,
electron
microscopic
and
morphometric
studies
of
estrogen
-induced
rat

prolactinomas
after
bromocriptine
treatment
.

To
clarify
the
effects
of
bromocriptine
on
prolactinoma
cells
in
vivo
,
immunohistochemical
,
ultrastructural
and
morphometrical
analyses
were
applied
to
estrogen
-induced
rat
prolactinoma
cells
1
h
and
6
h
after
injection
of
bromocriptine

(
3
mg
/
kg
of
body
weight
)
.

One
h
after
treatment
,
serum
prolactin
levels
decreased
markedly
.

Electron
microscopy
disclosed
many
secretory
granules
,
slightly
distorted
rough
endoplasmic
reticulum
,
and
partially
dilated
Golgi
cisternae
in
the
prolactinoma
cells
.

Morphometric
analysis
revealed
that
the
volume
density
of
secretory
granules
increased
,
while
the
volume
density
of
cytoplasmic
microtubules
decreased
.

These
findings
suggest
that
lowered
serum
prolactin
levels
in
the
early
phase
of
bromocriptine
treatment
may
result
from
an
impaired
secretion
of
prolactin
due
to
decreasing
numbers
of
cytoplasmic
microtubules
.

At
6
h
after
injection
,
serum
prolactin
levels
were
still
considerably
lower
than
in
controls
.

The
prolactinoma
cells
at
this
time
were
well
granulated
,
with
vesiculated
rough
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
markedly
dilated
Golgi
cisternae
.

Electron
microscopical
immunohistochemistry
revealed
positive
reaction
products
noted
on
the
secretory
granules
,
Golgi
cisternae
,
and
endoplasmic
reticulum
of
the
untreated
rat
prolactinoma
cells
.

However
,
only
secretory
granules
showed
the
positive
reaction
products
for
prolactin
6
h
after

bromocriptine
treatment
of
the
adenoma
cells
.

An
increase
in
the
volume
density
of
secretory
granules
and
a
decrease
in
the
volume
densities
of
rough
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
microtubules
was
determined
by
morphometric
analysis
,
suggesting
that
bromocriptine
inhibits
protein
synthesis
as
well
as
bringing
about
a
disturbance
of
the
prolactin
secretion
.

On
two
paradoxical
side
-
effects
of
prednisolone
in
rats
,
ribosomal
RNA
biosyntheses
,
and
a
mechanism
of
action
.

Liver
enlargement
and
muscle
wastage
occurred
in
Wistar
rats
following
the
subcutaneous
administration
of
prednisolone
.

In
the
liver
both
the
content
of
RNA
and
the
biosynthesis
of
ribosomal
RNA
increased
while
both
the
RNA
content
and
ribosomal
RNA
biosynthesis
were
reduced
in
the
gastrocnemius
muscle
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
drug
acted
in
a
selective
and
tissue
-
specific
manner
to
enhance
ribosomal
RNA
synthesis
in
the
liver
and
depress
such
synthesis
in
the
muscle
.

This
view
supports
the
contention
that
the
liver
and
muscle
are
independent
sites
of
prednisolone
action
.

Possible
intramuscular
midazolam

-associated

cardiorespiratory
arrest
and
death
.

Midazolam
hydrochloride
is
commonly
used
for
dental
or
endoscopic
procedures
.

Although
generally
consisted
safe
when
given
intramuscularly
,
intravenous
administration
is
known
to
cause
respiratory
and
cardiovascular
depression
.

This
report
describes
the
first
published
case
of
cardiorespiratory
arrest
and
death
associated
with
intramuscular
administration
of
midazolam
.

Information
regarding
midazolam
use
is
reviewed
to
provide
recommendation
for
safe
administration
.

Serial
epilepsy
caused
by
levodopa
/
carbidopa
administration
in
two
patients
on
hemodialysis
.

Two
patients
with
similar
clinical
features
are
presented
:
both
patients
had
chronic
renal
failure
,
on
hemodialysis
for
many
years
but
recently
begun
on
a
high
-
flux
dialyzer
;
both
had
been
receiving
a
carbidopa
/
levodopa
preparation
;
and
both
had
the
onset
of
hallucinosis
and
recurrent
seizures
,
which
were
refractory
to
anticonvulsants
.

The
first
patient
died
without
a
diagnosis
;
the
second
patient
had
a
dramatic
recovery
following
the
administration
of
vitamin
B6
.

Neither
patient
was
considered
to
have
a
renal
state
sufficiently
severe
enough
to
explain
their
presentation
.

Effect
of
L
-
alpha
-
glyceryl
-
phosphorylcholine
on
amnesia
caused
by
scopolamine
.

The
present
study
was
carried
out
to
test
the
effects
of
L
-
alpha
-
glycerylphosphorylcholine

(
L
-
alpha
-
GFC
)
on
memory
impairment
induced
by
scopolamine
in
man
.

Thirty
-
two
healthy
young
volunteers
were
randomly
allocated
to
four
different
groups
.

They
were
given
a
ten
day
pretreatment
with
either
L
-
alpha
-
GFC
or
placebo
,
p.o
.
,
and
on
the
eleventh
day
either
scopolamine
or
placebo
,
i.m
.

Before
and
0.5
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
and
6
h
after
injection
the
subjects
were
given
attention
and
mnemonic
tests
.

The
findings
of
this
study
indicate
that
the
drug
is
able
to
antagonize
impairment
of
attention
and
memory
induced
by
scopolamine
.

Seizures
induced
by
the
cocaine
metabolite
benzoylecgonine
in
rats
.

The
half
-
life
(
t1/2
)
of
cocaine
is
relatively
short
,
but
some
of
the
consequences
of
its
use
,
such
as
seizures
and
strokes
,
can
occur
hours
after
exposure
.

This
led
us
to
hypothesize
that
a
metabolite
of
cocaine
may
be
responsible
for
some
of
those
delayed
sequelae
.

We
evaluated
the
potential
of
the
major
metabolite
of
cocaine
,
benzoylecgonine

(
BE
)
,
to
cause
seizures
.

Two
separate
equimolar
doses
(
0.2
and
0.4
mumol
)
of
either
cocaine
or
BE
were
injected
ventricularly
in
unanesthetized
juvenile
rats
.

Treated
rats
were
then
evaluated
for
incidence
,
latency
,
and
seizure
pattern
or
for
locomotor
activity
in
animals
without
seizures
.

BE

-Induced

seizures
occurred
more
frequently
and
had
significantly
longer
latencies
than
those
induced
by
equimolar
amounts
of
cocaine
.

Whereas
cocaine
-induced
seizures
were
best
characterized
as
brief
,
generalized
,
and
tonic
and
resulted
in
death
,
those
induced
by
BE
were
prolonged
,
often
multiple
and
mixed
in
type
,
and
rarely
resulted
in
death
.

Electrical
recordings
from
the
hippocampus
showed
a
rhythmic
progression
in
EEG
frequency
and
voltage
with
clinical
seizure
expression
.

BE
-Injected
rats
that
did
not
have
seizures
had
significantly
more
locomotor
activity
than
cocaine
-injected
animals
without
seizures
.

The
finding
that
cocaine
-
and
BE
-induced

seizures
differ
in
several
respects
suggests
more
than
one
mechanism
for
cocaine

-induced

seizures
and
emphasizes
the
importance
of
a
cocaine
metabolite
,
BE
.

Protection
against
amphetamine
-induced
neurotoxicity
toward
striatal
dopamine
neurons
in
rodents
by
LY274614
,
an
excitatory
amino
acid
antagonist
.

LY274614
,
3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr
oisoquinoline-3-
carboxylic
acid
,
has
been
described
as
a
potent
antagonist
of
the
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
subtype
of
glutamate
receptor
.

Here
its
ability
to
antagonize
the
prolonged
depletion
of
dopamine
in
the
striatum
by
amphetamine
in

iprindole

-treated
rats
is
reported
.

A
single
18.4
mg
/
kg
(
i.p
.
)

dose
of
(
+
/-)-

amphetamine
hemisulfate
,
given
to
rats
pretreated
with
iprindole
,
resulted
in
persistent
depletion
of
dopamine
in
the
striatum
1
week
later
.

This
prolonged
depletion
of
dopamine
in
the
striatum
was
antagonized
by
dizocilpine

(
MK-801
,
a
non
-
competitive
antagonist
of
NMDA
receptors
)
or
by
LY274614

(
a
competitive
antagonist
of
NMDA
receptors
)
.

The
protective
effect
of
LY274614
was
dose

A
10
mg

dose
of

LY274614
was
effective
in
antagonizing
the
depletion
of
dopamine
in
the
striatum
,
when
given
as
long
as
8
hr
prior
to

but
not
when

Depletion
of

dopamine

was
also
antagonized
when
LY274614
was
given
after
the
injection
of
amphetamine
;
LY274614
protected
when

The

,
given
multiple

,
was
also
antagonized

The
data
strengthen
the
evidence
that
the
neurotoxic

of
amphetamine
and
related
compounds
toward
nigrostriatal
dopamine

involves
NMDA

that

Reversal
by
phenylephrine
of
the
beneficial
effects
of
intravenous
nitroglycerin
in
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
.

Nitroglycerin
has
been
shown
to
reduce
ST
-
segment
elevation
during
acute
myocardial
infarction
,
an
effect
potentiated
in
the
dog
by
agents
that
reverse

nitroglycerin
-induced

hypotension
.

Our
study
was
designed
to
determine
the
effects
of
combined
nitroglycerin
and
phenylephrine
therapy
.

Ten
patients
with
acute
transmural
myocardial
infarctions
received
intravenous
nitroglycerin
,
sufficient
to
reduce
mean
arterial
pressure
from
107
+
/-

6
to
85
+
/-

6
mm
Hg
(
P
less
than

)
,
for
60
minutes
.

Left

decreased
from

and
also

Our

CaCl2
-induced

thoracic
aortic
aneurysm
in
a
rat
model
.

PURPOSE
:

This
study
was
designed
to
establish
a
rat
model
of
thoracic
aortic
aneurysm

(
TAA
)
by
calcium
chloride

(
CaCl(2
)
)
-induced

arterial

and
to
explore
the
potential
role
of
a
disintegrin
and
metalloproteinase
(
ADAM
)
,
matrix
metalloproteinases
(
MMPs
)
and
their
endogenous
inhibitors
(
TIMPs
)
in
TAA
formation
.

METHODS
:

Thoracic
aorta
of
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
was
exposed
to
0.5
M
CaCl(2
)
or
normal
saline
(
NaCl
)
.

After
12weeks
,
animals
were
euthanized
,
and
CaCl(2
)
-treated
,
CaCl(2
)
-untreated
(
n=12
)
and
NaCl
-treated
aortic
segments
(
n=12
)
were
collected
for
histological
and
molecular
assessments
.

MMP
-
TIMP
and
ADAM

mRNAs
were
semi
-
quantitatively
analyzed
and
protein
expressions
were
determined
by
immunohistochemistry
.

RESULTS
:

Despite
similar
external
diameters
among
CaCl(2
)
-treated
,
non-
CaCl(2
)
-treated
and
NaCl
-treated
segments
,
aneurymal

(
n=6
,
50
%
)
,
media

with
regional
disruption
,
fragmentation
of
elastic
fiber
,
and
increased
collagen
deposition
(
n=12
,
100
%
)
were
demonstrated
in
CaCl(2
)
-treated
segments
.

MMP-2
,
MMP-9
,
ADAM-10
and
ADAM-17
mRNA
levels
were
increased
in
CaCl(2
)
-treated
segments
(
all
p<0.01
)
,
with
trends
of
elevation
in
CaCl(2
)
-untreated
segments
,
as
compared
with
NaCl
-treated
segments
.

Immunohistochemistry
displayed
significantly
increased
expressions
of

MMP-2
,
MMP-9
,
ADAM-10
and
ADAM-17
(
all
p<0.01
)
in
intima
and
media
for
CaCl(2
)
-treated
segments
.

TIMP

mRNA
and
tissue
levels
did
not
differ
obviously
among
the
three
aortic
segments
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
study
establishes
a
TAA
model
by
periarterial
CaCl(2
)
exposure
in
rats
,
and
demonstrates
a
significant
elevation
of
expression
of
MMP-2
,
MMP-9
,
ADAM10
and
ADAM17
in
the
pathogenesis
of
vascular
remodeling
.

When
drugs
disappear
from
the
patient
:
elimination
of
intravenous
medication
by
hemodiafiltration
.

Twenty
-
three
hours
after
heart
transplantation
,
life
-
threatening
acute

right
heart
failure
was
diagnosed
in
a
patient
requiring
continuous
venovenous
hemodiafiltration
(
CVVHDF
)
.

Increasing
doses
of
catecholamines
,
sedatives
,
and
muscle
relaxants
administered
through
a
central
venous
catheter
were
ineffective
.

However
,
a
bolus
of
epinephrine
injected
through
an
alternative
catheter
provoked
a
hypertensive
crisis
.

Thus
,
interference
with
the
central
venous
infusion
by
the
dialysis
catheter
was
suspected
.

The
catheters
were
changed
,
and
hemodynamics
stabilized
at
lower
catecholamine
doses
.

When
the
effects
of
IV
drugs
are
inadequate
in
patients
receiving
CVVHDF
,
interference
with
adjacent
catheters
resulting
in
elimination
of
the
drug
by
CVVHDF
should
be
suspected
.

Long
-
term
glutamate
supplementation
failed
to
protect
against
peripheral
neurotoxicity
of
paclitaxel
.

Toxic
peripheral
neuropathy
is
still
a
significant
limiting
factor
for
chemotherapy
with
paclitaxel

(
PAC
)
,
although
glutamate
and
its
closely
related
amino
acid

glutamine
were
claimed
to
ameliorate
PAC
neurotoxicity
.

This
pilot
trial
aimed
to
evaluate
the
role
of
glutamate
supplementation
for
preventing
PAC
-induced

peripheral
neuropathy
in
a
randomized
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
double
-
blinded
clinical
and
electro
-
diagnostic
study
.

Forty
-
three

ovarian
cancer
patients
were
available
for
analysis
following
six
cycles
of
the
same
PAC

-containing

regimen
:
23
had
been
supplemented
by
glutamate

all
along
the
treatment
period
,
at
a
daily
dose
of
three
times
500
mg
(
group
G
)
,
and
20
had
received
a
placebo
(
group
P
)
.

Patients
were
evaluated
by
neurological
examinations
,
questionnaires
and
sensory
-
motor
nerve
conduction
studies
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
frequency
of
signs
or
symptoms
between
the
two
groups
although
neurotoxicity
symptoms
presented
mostly
with
lower
scores
of
severity
in
group
G.

However
,
this
difference
reached
statistical
significance
only
with
regard
to
reported
pain
sensation
(
P
=
0.011
)
.

Also
the
frequency
of
abnormal
electro
-
diagnostic
findings
showed
similarity
between
the
two
groups
(
G
:
7/23
=
30.4
%
;
P
:
6/20
=
30
%
)
.

This
pilot
study
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
glutamate
supplementation
at
the
chosen
regimen
fails
to
protect
against
peripheral
neurotoxicity
of
PAC
.

Attentional
modulation
of
perceived
pain
intensity
in
capsaicin
-induced
secondary
hyperalgesia
.

Perceived
pain
intensity
is
modulated
by
attention
.

However
,
it
is
not
known
that
how
pain
intensity
ratings
are
affected
by
attention
in
capsaicin
-induced
secondary
hyperalgesia
.

Here
we
show
that
perceived
pain
intensity
in
secondary
hyperalgesia
is
decreased
when
attention
is
distracted
away
from
the
painful
pinprick
stimulus
with
a
visual
task
.

Furthermore
,
it
was
found
that
the
magnitude
of
attentional
modulation
in
secondary
hyperalgesia
is
very
similar
to
that
of
capsaicin

-untreated
,
control
condition
.

Our
findings
,
showing
no
interaction
between
capsaicin
treatment
and
attentional
modulation
suggest
that
capsaicin
-induced

secondary
hyperalgesia
and
attention
might
affect
mechanical
pain
through
independent
mechanisms
.

Testosterone
-dependent

hypertension
and
upregulation
of
intrarenal
angiotensinogen
in
Dahl
salt
-sensitive
rats
.

Blood
pressure
(
BP
)
is
more
salt
sensitive
in
men
than
in
premenopausal
women
.

In
Dahl
salt
-sensitive
rats
(
DS
)
,
high-
salt
(
HS
)
diet
increases
BP
more
in
males
than
females
.

In
contrast
to
the
systemic
renin-
angiotensin
system
,
which
is
suppressed
in
response
to
HS
in
male
DS
,
intrarenal
angiotensinogen
expression
is
increased
,
and
intrarenal
levels
of
ANG
II
are
not
suppressed
.

In
this
study
,
the
hypothesis
was
tested
that
there
is
a
sexual
dimorphism
in
HS
-
induced
upregulation
of
intrarenal
angiotensinogen
mediated
by
testosterone
that
also
causes
increases
in
BP
and
renal
injury
.

On
a
low-
salt
(
LS
)
diet
,
male
DS
had
higher
levels
of
intrarenal
angiotensinogen
mRNA
than
females
.

HS
diet
for
4
wk
increased
renal
cortical
angiotensinogen
mRNA
and
protein
only
in
male
DS
,
which
was
prevented
by
castration
.

Ovariectomy
of
female
DS
had
no
effect
on
intrarenal
angiotensinogen
expression
on
either
diet
.

Radiotelemetric
BP
was
similar
between
males
and
castrated
rats
on
LS
diet
.

HS
diet
for
4
wk
caused
a
progressive
increase
in
BP
,
protein
and
albumin
excretion
,
and
glomerular
sclerosis
in
male
DS
rats
,
which
were
attenuated
by
castration
.

Testosterone
replacement
in
castrated
DS
rats
increased
BP
,
renal
injury
,
and
upregulation
of
renal
angiotensinogen
associated
with
HS
diet
.

Testosterone
contributes
to
the
development
of
hypertension
and
renal
injury
in
male
DS
rats
on
HS
diet
possibly
through
upregulation
of
the
intrarenal
renin-
angiotensin
system
.

Prenatal
protein
deprivation
alters

dopamine
-mediated
behaviors
and
dopaminergic
and
glutamatergic
receptor
binding
.

Epidemiological
evidence
indicates
that
prenatal
nutritional
deprivation
may
increase
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
.

The
goal
of
these
studies
was
to
use
an
animal
model
to
examine
the
effects
of
prenatal
protein
deprivation
on
behaviors
and
receptor
binding
with
relevance
to
schizophrenia
.

We
report
that
prenatally
protein
deprived
(
PD
)
female
rats
showed
an
increased
stereotypic
response
to
apomorphine
and
an
increased
locomotor
response
to
amphetamine
in
adulthood
.

These
differences
were
not
observed
during
puberty
.

No
changes
in
haloperidol
-induced
catalepsy
or
MK-801

-induced
locomotion
were
seen
following
PD
.

In
addition
,
PD
female
rats
showed
increased

(
3
)
H
-
MK-801

binding
in
the
striatum
and
hippocampus
,
but
not
in
the
cortex
.

PD
female
rats
also
showed
increased
(
3
)
H
-
haloperidol
binding
and
decreased

dopamine
transporter
binding
in
striatum
.

No
statistically
significant
changes
in
behavior
or
receptor
binding
were
found
in
PD
males
with
the
exception
of
increased
(
3
)
H
-
MK-801
binding
in
cortex
.

This
animal
model
may
be
useful
to
explore
the
mechanisms
by
which
prenatal
nutritional
deficiency
enhances
risk
for
schizophrenia
in
humans
and
may
also
have
implications
for
developmental
processes
leading
to
differential
sensitivity
to
drugs
of
abuse
.

mToR
inhibitors
-
induced
proteinuria
:
mechanisms
,
significance
,
and
management
.

Massive
urinary
protein
excretion
has
been
observed
after
conversion
from
calcineurin
inhibitors
to
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin

(
mToR
)
inhibitors
,
especially
sirolimus
,
in
renal
transplant
recipients
with
chronic
allograft
nephropathy
.

Because
proteinuria
is
a
major
predictive
factor
of
poor
transplantation
outcome
,
many
studies
focused
on
this
adverse
event
during
the
past
years
.

Whether
proteinuria
was
due
to
sirolimus
or
only
a
consequence
of
calcineurin
inhibitors
withdrawal
remained
unsolved
until
high
range

proteinuria
has
been
observed
during
sirolimus
therapy
in
islet
transplantation
and
in
patients
who
received
sirolimus
de
novo
.

Podocyte
injury
and
focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
have
been
related
to
mToR
inhibition
in
some
patients
,
but
the
pathways
underlying
these
lesions
remain
hypothetic
.

We
discuss
herein
the
possible
mechanisms
and
the
significance
of
mToR
blockade
-
induced
proteinuria
.

Hypothalamic
prolactin
receptor
messenger

ribonucleic
acid
levels
,
prolactin
signaling
,
and
hyperprolactinemic
inhibition
of
pulsatile
luteinizing
hormone
secretion
are
dependent
on
estradiol
.

Hyperprolactinemia
can
reduce
fertility
and
libido
.

Although
central
prolactin
actions
are
thought
to
contribute
to
this
,
the
mechanisms
are
poorly
understood
.

We
first
tested
whether
chronic
hyperprolactinemia
inhibited
two
neuroendocrine
parameters
necessary
for
female
fertility
:
pulsatile
LH
secretion
and
the
estrogen
-induced
LH
surge
.

Chronic
hyperprolactinemia
induced
by
the
dopamine
antagonist
sulpiride
caused
a
40
%
reduction
LH
pulse
frequency
in
ovariectomized
rats
,
but
only
in
the
presence
of
chronic
low
levels
of
estradiol
.

Sulpiride
did
not
affect
the
magnitude
of
a
steroid
-induced
LH
surge
or
the
percentage
of
GnRH
neurons
activated
during
the
surge
.

Estradiol
is
known
to
influence
expression
of
the
long
form
of
prolactin
receptors
(
PRL
-
R
)
and
components
of
prolactin
's
signaling
pathway
.

To
test
the
hypothesis
that
estrogen
increases
PRL
-
R
expression
and
sensitivity
to
prolactin
,
we
next
demonstrated
that
estradiol
greatly
augments
prolactin
-
induced
STAT5
activation
.

Lastly
,
we
measured
PRL
-
R
and
suppressor
of
cytokine
signaling
(
SOCS-1
and
-3
and
CIS
,
which
reflect
the
level
of
prolactin
signaling
)

mRNAs
in
response
to

sulpiride
and
estradiol
.

Sulpiride
induced
only
SOCS-1
in
the
medial
preoptic
area
,
where
GnRH
neurons
are
regulated
,
but
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
and
choroid
plexus
,
PRL
-
R
,
SOCS-3
,
and
CIS
mRNA
levels
were
also
induced
.

Estradiol
enhanced
these
effects
on
SOCS-3
and
CIS
.

Interestingly
,
estradiol
also
induced
PRL
-
R
,
SOCS-3
,
and
CIS
mRNA
levels
independently
.

These
data
show
that
GnRH
pulse
frequency
is
inhibited
by
chronic
hyperprolactinemia
in
a
steroid
-dependent
manner
.

They
also
provide
evidence
for
estradiol

-dependent
and

brain
region
-
specific
regulation
of
PRL
-
R
expression
and
signaling
responses
by
prolactin
.

Estrogen
prevents
cholesteryl
ester
accumulation
in
macrophages
induced
by
the
HIV
protease
inhibitor
ritonavir
.

Individuals
with
HIV
can
now
live
long
lives
with
drug
therapy
that
often
includes
protease
inhibitors
such
as
ritonavir
.

Many
patients
,
however
,
develop
negative
long
-
term
side
effects
such
as
premature
atherosclerosis
.

We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
ritonavir
treatment
increases

atherosclerotic
lesion
formation
in
male
mice
to
a
greater
extent
than
in
female
mice
.

Furthermore
,
peripheral
blood
monocytes
isolated
from
ritonavir

-treated
females
had
less
cholesteryl
ester
accumulation
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
have
investigated
the
molecular
mechanisms
by
which
female
hormones
influence
cholesterol
metabolism
in
macrophages
in
response
to
the
HIV
protease
inhibitor
ritonavir
.

We
have
utilized
the
human
monocyte
cell
line
,
THP-1
as
a
model
to
address
this
question
.

Briefly
,
cells
were
differentiated
for
72
h
with
100
nM
PMA
to
obtain
a
macrophage
-
like
phenotype
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
1
nM
17beta
-
estradiol

(
E2
)
,
100
nM
progesterone
or
vehicle
(
0.01
%
ethanol
)
.

Cells
were
then
treated
with
30
ng
/
ml
ritonavir
or
vehicle
in
the
presence
of
aggregated
LDL
for
24
h.
Cell

were
harvested

was
isolated
.

E2
decreased
the
accumulation
of
cholesteryl
esters
in
macrophages
following
ritonavir
treatment
.

Ritonavir
increased
the
expression
of
the
scavenger
receptor
,
CD36
mRNA
,
responsible
for
the
uptake
of
LDL
.

Additionally
,
ritonavir
treatment
selectively
increased
the
relative
levels
of
PPARgamma
mRNA
,
a
transcription
factor
responsible
for
the
regulation
of
CD36
mRNA
expression
.

Treatment
with
E2
,
however
,
failed
to
prevent
these
increases
at
the
mRNA
level
.

E2
did
,
however
,
significantly
suppress
CD36
protein
levels
as
measured
by
fluorescent
immunocytochemistry
.

This
data
suggests
that
E2
modifies
the
expression
of
CD36
at
the
level
of
protein
expression
in
monocyte
-
derived
macrophages
resulting
in
reduced
cholesteryl
ester
accumulation
following
ritonavir
treatment
.

Upregulation
of
brain
expression
of
P
-
glycoprotein
in
MRP2-deficient
TR(-
)
rats
resembles
seizure
-induced
up
-
regulation
of
this
drug
efflux
transporter
in
normal
rats
.

PURPOSE
:

The
multidrug
resistance
protein
2
(
MRP2
)
is
a
drug
efflux
transporter
that
is
expressed
predominantly
at
the
apical
domain
of
hepatocytes
but
seems
also
to
be
expressed
at
the
apical
membrane
of
brain
capillary
endothelial
cells
that
form
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
.

MRP2
is
absent
in
the
transport
-
deficient
(
TR(-
)
)

Wistar
rat
mutant
,
so
that
this
rat
strain
was
very
helpful
in
defining
substrates
of
MRP2
by
comparing
tissue
concentrations
or
functional
activities
of
compounds
in
MRP2-deficient
rats
with
those
in
transport
-
competent
Wistar
rats
.

By
using
this
strategy
to
study
the
involvement
of
MRP2
in
brain
access
of
antiepileptic
drugs
(
AEDs
)
,
we
recently
reported
that
phenytoin
is
a
substrate
for
MRP2
in
the
BBB
.

However
,
one
drawback
of
such
studies
in
genetically
deficient
rats
is
the
fact
that
compensatory
changes
with
upregulation
of
other
transporters
can
occur
.

This
prompted
us
to
study
the
brain
expression
of
P
-
glycoprotein
(
Pgp
)
,
a
major
drug
efflux
transporter
in
many
tissues
,
including
the
BBB
,
in
TR(-
)
rats
compared
with
nonmutant
(
wild
-
type
)

Wistar
rats
.

METHODS
:

The
expression
of
MRP2
and
Pgp
in
brain
and
liver
sections
of
TR(-
)
rats
and
normal
Wistar
rats
was
determined
with
immunohistochemistry
,
by
using
a
novel
,
highly
selective
monoclonal
MRP2
antibody
and
the
monoclonal
Pgp
antibody
C219
,
respectively
.

RESULTS
:

Immunofluorescence
staining
with
the
MRP2
antibody
was
found
to
label
a
high
number
of
microvessels
throughout
the
brain
in
normal
Wistar
rats
,
whereas
such
labeling
was
absent
in
TR(-
)
rats
.

TR(-
)
rats
exhibited
a
significant
up
-
regulation
of
Pgp
in
brain
capillary
endothelial
cells
compared
with
wild
-
type
controls
.

No
such
obvious
upregulation
of
Pgp
was
observed
in
liver
sections
.

A
comparable
overexpression
of
Pgp
in
the
BBB
was
obtained
after
pilocarpine
-induced
seizures
in
wild
-
type
Wistar
rats
.

Experiments
with
systemic
administration
of
the
Pgp
substrate
phenobarbital
and
the
selective
Pgp
inhibitor
tariquidar
in
TR(-
)
rats
substantiated
that
Pgp
is
functional
and
compensates
for
the
lack
of
MRP2
in
the
BBB
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
data
on
TR(-
)
rats
indicate
that
Pgp
plays
an
important
role
in
the
compensation
of
MRP2
deficiency
in
the
BBB
.

Because
such
a
compensatory
mechanism
most
likely
occurs
to
reduce
injury
to
the
brain
from
cytotoxic
compounds
,
the
present
data
substantiate
the
concept
that
MRP2
performs
a
protective
role
in
the
BBB
.

Furthermore
,
our
data
suggest
that
TR(-
)
rats
are
an
interesting
tool
to
study
consequences
of
overexpression
of
Pgp
in
the
BBB
on
access
of
drugs
in
the
brain
,
without
the
need
of
inducing
seizures
or
other
Pgp
-
enhancing
events
for
this
purpose
.

Use
of
chromosome

to
identify
seizure
susceptibility
loci
in
mice
.

Seizure
susceptibility
varies
among
inbred
mouse
strains
.

Chromosome
substitution
strains
(
CSS
)
,
in
which
a
single
chromosome
from
one
inbred
strain
(
donor
)
has
been
transferred
onto
a
second
strain
(
host
)
by
repeated
backcrossing
,
may
be
used
to
identify
quantitative
trait
loci
(
QTLs
)
that
contribute
to
seizure
susceptibility
.

QTLs
for
susceptibility
to
pilocarpine

-induced

seizures
,
a
model
of
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
,
have
not
been
reported
,
and
CSS
have
not
previously
been
used
to
localize
seizure
susceptibility
genes
.

We
report
QTLs
identified
using
a
B6
(
host
)

x
A
/
J
(
donor
)

CSS
panel
to
localize
genes
involved
in
susceptibility
to
pilocarpine

-induced
seizures
.

Three
hundred
fifty
-
five
adult
male
CSS
mice
,
58
B6
,
and
39
A
/
J
were
tested
for
susceptibility
to
pilocarpine

-induced

seizures
.

Highest
stage
reached
and
latency
to
each
stage
were
recorded
for
all
mice
.

B6
mice
were
resistant
to
seizures
and
slower
to
reach
stages
compared
to
A
/
J
mice
.

The
CSS
for
Chromosomes
10
and
18
progressed
to
the
most
severe
stages
,
diverging
dramatically
from
the
B6
phenotype
.

Latencies
to
stages
were
also
significantly
shorter
for
CSS10
and
CSS18
mice
.

CSS
mapping
suggests
seizure
susceptibility
loci
on
mouse
Chromosomes

and
18
.

This
approach
provides
a
framework
for
identifying

Investigation
of
mitochondrial
involvement
in
the
experimental
model
of
epilepsy
induced
by
pilocarpine
.

Mitochondrial
abnormalities
have
been
associated
with
several
aspects
of
epileptogenesis
,
such
as
energy
generation
,
control
of
cell
death
,
neurotransmitter
synthesis
,
and
free
radical
(
FR
)
production
.

Increased
production
of
FRs
may
cause
mtDNA
damage
leading
to
decreased
activities
of
oxidative
phosphorylation
complexes
containing
mtDNA
-
encoded
subunits
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
whether
increased
generation
of
FR
during
status
epilepticus
would
be
sufficient
to
provoke
abnormalities
in
mtDNA
and
in
the
expression
and
activity
of
cytochrome
c
oxidase
(
CCO
)
,
complex
IV
of
the
respiratory
chain
,
in
the
chronic
phase
of
the
pilocarpine
model
of
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
.

DNA
analysis
revealed
low
amounts
of
a
4.8
kb
mtDNA
deletion
but
with
no
differences
in
frequency
or
quantity
in
the
control
and
experimental
groups
.

We
did
not
find
abnormalities
in
the
expression
and
distribution
of
an
mtDNA
-
encoded
subunit
of
CCO
(
CCO
-
I
)
or
a
relative
decrease
in
CCO
-

I
when
compared
with
nuclear
-
encoded
subunits
(
CCO
-
IV
and
SDH
-
fp
)
.

No
abnormality
in
CCO
activity
was
observed
through
histochemistry
.

Although
evidences
of
mitochondrial
abnormalities
were
found
in
previously
published
studies
,
our
results
do
not
suggest
that
the
FRs
,
generated
during
the
acute
phase
,
determined
important
abnormalities
in
mtDNA
,
in
expression
of
CCO
-
I
,
and
in
CCO
activity
.

Causes
of
acute
thrombotic
microangiopathy
in
patients
receiving
kidney
transplantation
.

OBJECTIVES
:

Thrombotic
microangiopathy
is
a
well
-
known
problem
in
patients
following
renal
transplantation
.

In
postrenal
transplantation
,
thrombotic
microangiopathy
is
often
a
reflection
of
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
.

We
aimed
to
determine
the
causes
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
in
a
population
of
renal
transplantation
recipients
and
discuss
the
literature
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS

:
We
investigated
the
causes
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
during
a
1-year
period
,
from
June
2003
to
June
2004
,
at
the
King
Fahad
National
Guard
Hospital
in
Riyadh
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
by
reviewing
the
slides
of
all
transplant
biopsies
(
n=25
)
performed
during
this
interval
.

Pre-
and
posttransplant
crossmatching
was
done
when
possible
.

RESULTS
:

Five
cases
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
were
found
.

Three
of
these
cases
were
from
the
25
transplantations
performed
at
King
Fahad
National
Guard
Hospital
,
while
the
other
2
transplantations
had
been
performed
abroad
and
were
referred
to
us
for
follow
-
up
.

Three
cases
were
related
to
cyclosporine
,
and
1
case
was
secondary
to
both
cyclosporine
and
tacrolimus
.

The
fifth
case
had
features
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
related
to
an
antiphospholipid
syndrome
in
a
patient
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
the
literature
,
the
most
-
frequent
cause
of
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
in
patients
following
renal
transplantation
is
recurrence
of
the
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
.

Other
causes
include
drug
-
related
(
cyclosporine
,
tacrolimus
)
toxicity
,
procoagulant
status
,
and
antibody
-
mediated
rejection
.

We
found
that
the
most
-
frequent
cause
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
was
drug
related
,
secondary
mainly
to
cyclosporine
.

In
the
current
study
,
the
frequency
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
was
similar
to
the
percentage
reported
in
the
literature
(
20
%
)
.

Severe

.

Catecholamine
-induced
cardiomyopathy
due
to
chronic
excess
of
endogenous
catecholamines
has
been
recognized
for
decades
as
a
clinical
phenomenon
.

In
contrast
,
reports
of
myocardial
dysfunction
due
to
acute
iatrogenic

overdose
are
rare
.

A
35-year
-
old
woman
whose
cervix
uteri
was
inadvertently
injected
with
8
mg
of
epinephrine
developed
myocardial
stunning
that
was
characterized
by
severe
hemodynamic
compromise
,
profound
,
albeit
transient
,
left
ventricular
systolic
and
diastolic
dysfunction
,
and
only
modestly
elevated
biochemical
markers
of
myocardial
necrosis
.

Our
case
illustrates
the
serious
consequences
of
medical
errors
that
can
be
avoided
through
improved

supervision
.

Urinary
bladder
cancer
in
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
:
risks
and
relation
to
cyclophosphamide
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
assess
and
characterise
the
risk
of
bladder
cancer
,
and
its
relation
to
cyclophosphamide
,
in
patients
with
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
.

METHODS
:

In
the
population
based
,
nationwide
Swedish
Inpatient
Register
a
cohort
of
1065
patients
with
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
,
1969
-
95
,
was
identified
.

Through
linkage
with
the
Swedish
Cancer
Register
,
all
subjects
in
this
cohort
diagnosed
with
bladder
cancer
were
identified
.

Nested
within
the
cohort
,
a
matched
case
-
control
study
was
performed
to
estimate
the
association
between
cyclophosphamide
and
bladder
cancer
using
odds
ratios
(
ORs
)
as
relative
risk
.

In
the
cohort
the
cumulative
risk
of
bladder
cancer
after
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
,
and
the
relative
prevalence
of
a
history
of
bladder
cancer
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
of
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
,
were
also
estimated
.

RESULTS
:

The
median
cumulative
doses
of
cyclophosphamide
among
cases
(
n
=
11
)
and
controls
(
n
=
25
)
were
113
g
and
25
g
,
respectively
.

The
risk
of
bladder
cancer
doubled
for
every
10
g
increment
in
cyclophosphamide

(
OR
=
2.0
,
95
%
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
0.8
to
4.9
)
.

Treatment
duration
longer
than
1
year
was
associated
with
an
eightfold
increased
risk
(
OR
=
7.7
,
95
%
CI
0.9
to
69
)
.

The
absolute
risk
for
bladder
cancer
in
the
cohort
reached
10
%
16
years
after
diagnosis
of
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
,
and
a
history
of
bladder
cancer
was
(
non
-
significantly
)
twice
as
common
as
expected
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
of
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
results
indicate
a
dose
-
response
relationship
between
cyclophosphamide
and
the
risk
of
bladder
cancer
,
high
cumulative
risks
in
the
entire
cohort
,
and
also
the
possibility
of
risk
factors
operating
even
before
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
.

L

.

A
deficient
L

-
nitric
oxide
system
is
implicated
in
cortisol

-induced

hypertension
.

We
investigate
whether
abnormalities
in
L
-
arginine
uptake
contribute
to
this
deficiency
.

Eight
healthy
men
were
recruited
.

Hydrocortisone
acetate
(
50
mg
)
was
given
orally
every
6
hours
for
24
hours
after
a
5-day
fixed

salt
diet
(
150
mmol

)
.

Crossover
studies
were
performed
2
weeks
apart
.

Thirty
milliliters
of
blood
was
obtained
for
isolation
of
peripheral

after
each
treatment
period
.

L

arginine
uptake
was
assessed
in
mononuclear
cells
incubated
with
L

arginine

(
1
to
300
micromol
/

)
,
incorporating
100
nmol

-
arginine
for
a
period
of
5
minutes
at
37
degrees
C.
Forearm
[

arginine
extraction
was
calculated
after

of
[

arginine
into
the
brachial
artery
at
a
rate
of
100
nCi
/

for
80
minutes
.

Deep
forearm
venous
samples
were
collected
for
determination
of
L

extraction
.

Plasma
cortisol

concentrations
were
significantly
raised
during
the
active
phase
(
323+/-43
to
1082+/-245

mmol
/
L
,
P<0.05
)
.

Systolic
blood
pressure
was
elevated
by
an
average
of
7
mm
Hg
.

Neither
L

into
mononuclear

,
26.3+/-3.6
vs

000
cells
per

minutes
,
respectively
,
at
an
l

concentration
of
300

)
nor
L

in
the

)
was
affected
by
cortisol
treatment
;
ie
,
that
L
-
arginine
uptake
is
not
affected
by
short
-
term
cortisol
treatment
.

We
conclude
that
cortisol
-induced
increases
in

are
not
associated
with
abnormalities
in

patients
.

Our
objective
was
to
investigate
brain
MR
imaging
findings
and
the
utility
of
diffusion
-
weighted
(
DW
)
imaging
in
organ
transplant
patients
who
developed
neurologic
symptoms
during
tacrolimus
therapy
.

Brain
MR
studies
,
including
DW
imaging
,
were
prospectively
performed
in
14
organ
transplant
patients
receiving
tacrolimus
who
developed
neurologic
complications
.

In
each
patient
who
had
abnormalities
on
the
initial
MR
study
,
a
follow
-
up
MR
study
was
performed
1
month
later
.

Apparent
diffusion
coefficient
(
ADC
)
values
on
the
initial
MR
study
were
correlated
with
reversibility
of
the
lesions
.

Of
the
14
patients
,
5
(
35.7
%
)
had
white
matter
abnormalities
,
1
(
7.1
%
)
had
putaminal
hemorrhage
,
and
8
(
57.1
%
)
had
normal
findings
on
initial
MR
images
.

Among
the
5
patients
with
white
matter
abnormalities
,
4
patients
(
80.0
%
)
showed
higher
than
normal
ADC
values
on
initial
MR
images
,
and
all
showed
complete
resolution
on
follow
-
up
images
.

The
remaining
1
patient
(
20.0
%
)
showed
lower
than
normal
ADC
value
and
showed
incomplete
resolution
with
cortical
laminar
necrosis
.

Diffusion

Sequential
observations
of
exencephaly
and
subsequent
morphological
changes
by
mouse
exo
utero
development
system
:
analysis
of
the
mechanism
of
transformation
from
exencephaly
to
anencephaly
.

Anencephaly
has
been
suggested
to
develop
from
exencephaly
;
however
,
there
is
little
direct
experimental
evidence
to
support
this
,
and
the
mechanism
of
transformation
remains
unclear
.

We
examined
this
theory
using
the
exo
utero
development
system
that
allows
direct
and
sequential
observations
of
mid-
to
late
-
gestation
mouse
embryos
.

We
observed
the
exencephaly
induced
by
5-azacytidine
at
embryonic
day
13.5

(
E13.5
)

,
let
the
embryos
develop
exo
utero
until
E18.5
,
and
re
-
observed
the
same
embryos
at
E18.5
.

We
confirmed
several
cases
of
transformation
from
exencephaly
to
anencephaly
.

However
,
in
many
cases
,
the
exencephalic
brain
tissue
was
preserved
with
more
or
less
reduction
during
this
period
.

To
analyze
the
transformation
patterns
,
we
classified
the
exencephaly
by
size
and
shape
of
the
exencephalic
tissue
into
several
types
at
E13.5
and
E18.5
.

It
was
found
that
the
transformation
of
exencephalic
tissue
was
not
simply
size
-
dependent
,
and
all
cases
of
anencephaly
at
E18.5
resulted
from
embryos
with
a
large
amount
of
exencephalic
tissue
at
E13.5
.

Microscopic
observation
showed
the
configuration
of
exencephaly
at
E13.5
,
frequent
hemorrhaging
and
detachment
of
the
neural
plate
from
surface
ectoderm
in
the
exencephalic
head
at
E15.5
,
and
multiple
modes
of
reduction
in
the
exencephalic
tissue
at
E18.5
.

From
observations
of
the
vasculature
,
altered
distribution
patterns
of
vessels
were
identified
in
the
exencephalic
head
.

These
findings
suggest
that
overgrowth
of
the
exencephalic
neural
tissue
causes
the
altered
distribution
patterns
of
vessels
,
subsequent
peripheral
circulatory
failure
and/or
hemorrhaging
in
various
parts
of
the
exencephalic
head
,
leading
to
the
multiple
modes
of
tissue
reduction
during
transformation
from
exencephaly
to
anencephaly
.

Acute
cocaine
-induced
seizures
:
differential
sensitivity
of
six
inbred
mouse
strains
.

Mature
male
and
female
mice
from
six
inbred
stains
were
tested
for
susceptibility
to
behavioral
seizures
induced
by
a
single
injection
of
cocaine
.

Cocaine
was
injected
ip
over
a
range
of
doses
(
50
-
100
mg
/
kg
)
and
behavior
was
monitored
for
20
minutes
.

Seizure
end
points
included
latency
to
forelimb
or
hindlimb
clonus
,
latency
to
clonic
running
seizure
and
latency
to
jumping
bouncing
seizure
.

A
range
of
strain
specific
sensitivities
was
documented
with
A
/
J
and
SJL
mice
being
most
sensitive
and
C57BL/6J
most
resistant
.

DBA/2J
,
BALB
/
cByJ
and
NZW
/
LacJ
strains
exhibited
intermediate
sensitivity
.

EEG
recordings
were
made
in
SJL
,
A
/
J
and
C57BL/6J
mice
revealing
a
close
correspondence
between
electrical
activity
and
behavior
.

Additionally
,
levels
of
cocaine
determined
in
hippocampus
and
cortex
were
not
different
between
sensitive
and
resistant
strains
.

Additional
studies
of
these
murine
strains
may
be
useful
for
investigating
genetic
influences
on
cocaine
-induced
seizures
.

Microangiopathic
hemolytic
anemia
complicating
FK506

(
tacrolimus
)
therapy
.

We
describe
3
episodes
of
microangiopathic
hemolytic
anemia

(
MAHA
)
in
2
solid
organ
recipients
under
FK506

(
tacrolimus
)
therapy
.

In
both
cases
,
discontinuation
of
FK506
and
treatment
with
plasma
exchange
,
fresh
frozen
plasma
replacement
,
corticosteroids
,
aspirin
,
and
dipyridamole
led
to
resolution
of
MAHA
.

In
one
patient
,
reintroduction
of
FK506
led
to
rapid
recurrence
of
MAHA
.

FK506
-associated

MAHA
is
probably
rare
but
physicians
must
be
aware
of
this
severe
complication
.

In
our
experience
and
according
to
the
literature
,
FK506
does
not
seem
to
cross
-
react
with
cyclosporin
A

(
CyA
)
,
an
immuno
-
suppressive
drug
already
known
to
induce
MAHA
.

Variant
ventricular
tachycardia
in
desipramine
toxicity
.

We
report
a
case
of
variant
ventricular
tachycardia
induced
by
desipramine
toxicity
.

Unusual
features
of
the
arrhythmia
are
repetitive
group
beating
,
progressive
shortening
of
the
R
-
R
interval
,
progressive
widening
of
the
QRS
complex
with
eventual
failure
of
intraventricular
conduction
,
and
changes
in
direction
of
the
QRS
axis
.

Recognition
of
variant
ventricular
tachycardia
is
important
because
therapy
differs
from
that
of
classic
ventricular
tachycardia
.

Desipramine
-induced
delirium
at
"
subtherapeutic
"
concentrations
:
a
case
report
.

An
elderly
patient
treated
with
low
dose

Desipramine
developed
a
delirium
while
her
plasma
level
was
in
the
"
subtherapeutic
"
range
.

Delirium
,
which
may
be
induced
by
tricyclic
drug
therapy
in
the
elderly
,
can
be
caused
by
tricyclics
with
low
anticholinergic
potency
.

Therapeutic
ranges
for
antidepressants
that
have
been
derived
from
general
adult
population
studies
may
not
be
appropriate
for
the
elderly
.

Further
studies
of
specifically
elderly
patients
are
now
required
to
establish
safer
and
more
appropriate
guidelines
for
drug
therapy
.

Mouse
strain
-
dependent
effect
of
amantadine
on
motility
and
brain
biogenic
amines
.

The
effect
of
amantadine
hydrochloride
,
injected
i.p
.

in
6
increments
of
100
mg
/
kg
each
over
30
hr
,
on
mouse
motility
and
whole
brain
content
of
selected
biogenic
amines
and
major
metabolites
was
studied
in
4
strains
of
mice
.

These
were
the
albino
Sprague
-
Dawley
ICR
and
BALB
/
C
,
the
black
C57BL/6
and
the
brown
CDF

-
I
mouse
strains
.

Amantadine
treatment
produced
a
biphasic
effect
on
mouse
motility
.

The
initial
dose
of
amantadine
depressed
locomotor
activity
in
all
mouse
strains
studied
with
the
BALB
/
C
mice
being
the
most
sensitive
.

Subsequent
amantadine
treatments
produced
enhancement
of
motility
from
corresponding
control
in
all
mouse
strains
with
the
BALB
/
C
mice
being
the
least
sensitive
.

The
locomotor
activity
was
decreased
from
corresponding
controls
in
all
strains
studied
,
except
for
the
ICR
mice
,
during
an
overnight
drug
-
free
period
following
the
fourth
amantadine
treatment
.

Readministration
of
amantadine
,
after
a
drug
-
free
overnight
period
,
increased
motility
from
respective
saline
control
in
all
strains
with
exception
of
the
BALB
/
C
mice
where
suppression
of
motility
occurred
.

Treatment
with
amantadine
did
not
alter
whole
brain
dopamine
levels
but
decreased
the
amounts
of
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid
in
the
BALB
/
C
mice
compared
to
saline
control
.

Conversely
,
brain
normetanephrine
concentration
was
increased
from
saline
control
by
amantadine
in
the
BALB
/
C
mice
.

The
results
suggest
a
strain
-
dependent
effect
of
amantadine
on
motility
and
indicate
a
differential
response
to
the
acute
and
multiple
dose
regimens
used
.

The
BALB
/
C
mouse
was
the
most
sensitive
strain
and
could
serve
as
the
strain
of
choice
for
evaluating
the
side
effects
of
amantadine
.

The
biochemical
results
of
brain
biogenic
amines
of
BALB
/
C
mouse
strain
suggest
a
probable
decrease
of
catecholamine
turnover
rate
and/or
metabolism
by
monoamine
oxidase
and
a
resulting
increase
in
O
-
methylation
of
norepinephrine
which
may
account
for
a
behavioral
depression
caused
by
amantadine
in
the
BALB
/
C
mice
.

No
enhancement
by
phenobarbital
of
the
hepatocarcinogenicity
of
a
choline
-devoid
diet
in
the
rat
.

An
experiment
was
performed
to
test
whether
inclusion
of
phenobarbital
in
a
choline
-devoid
diet
would
increase
the
hepatocarcinogenicity
of
the
diet
.

Groups
of
5-week
old
male
Fischer-344
rats
were
fed
for
7
-
25
months
semipurified

choline
-devoid
or
choline
-supplemented
diets
,
containing
or
not
0.06
%
phenobarbital
.

No
hepatic
preneoplastic
nodules
or
hepatocellular
carcinomas
developed
in
rats
fed
the
plain
choline
-supplemented
diet
,
while
one
preneoplastic
nodule
and
one
hepatocellular
carcinoma
developed
in
two
rats
fed
the
same
diet
containing
phenobarbital
.

The
incidence
of
preneoplastic
nodules
and
of
hepatocellular
carcinomas
was
10
%
and
37
%
,
respectively
,
in
rats
fed
the
plain
choline
-devoid
diet
,
and
17
%
and
30
%
,
in
rats
fed
the
phenobarbital
-containing

choline
-devoid
diet
.

The
results
evinced
no
enhancement
of
the
hepatocarcinogenicity
of
the
choline
-devoid
diet
by
phenobarbital
.

Sporadic
neoplastic
lesions
were
observed
in
organs
other
than
the

of
some
of
the
animals
,
irrespective
of

Effect
of
direct
intracoronary
administration
of
methylergonovine
in
patients
with
and
without
variant
angina
.

The
effects
of
intracoronary
administration
of
methylergonovine
were
studied
in
21
patients
with
variant
angina
and
22
patients
with
atypical
chest
pain
and
in
others
without
angina
pectoris

(

)
.

Methylergonovine
was
administered
continuously
at
a
rate
of
10
micrograms
/
min
up
to
50
micrograms
.

In
all
patients
with
variant
angina
,
coronary
spasm
was
provoked
at
a
mean
dose
of
28
+
/-
13
micrograms
(
mean
+
/-
SD
)
.

In
the
control
group
neither
ischemic
ST
change
nor
localized
spasm
occurred
.

The
basal
tone
of
the
right
coronary
artery
was
significantly
lower
than
that
of
the
left
coronary
artery
.

The
percentage
of
vasoconstriction
of
the
right
coronary
artery
was
significantly
higher
than
that
of
the
left
coronary
artery
.

These
results
suggest
that
spasm
provocation
tests
,
which
use
an
intracoronary
injection
of
a
relatively
low
dose
of
methylergonovine
,
have
a
high
sensitivity
in
variant
angina
and
the
vasoreactivity
of
the
right
coronary
artery
may
be
greater
than
that
of
the
other
coronary
arteries
.

Effects
of
aminophylline
on
the
threshold
for
initiating
ventricular
fibrillation
during
respiratory
failure
.

Cardiac
arrhythmias
have
frequently
been
reported
in
association
with
respiratory
failure
.

The
possible
additive
role
of
pharmacologic
agents
in
precipitating
cardiac
disturbances
in
patients
with
respiratory
failure
has
only
recently
been
emphasized
.

The
effects
of
aminophylline
on
the
ventricular
fibrillation
threshold
during
normal
acid
-
base
conditions
and
during
respiratory
failure
were
studied
in
anesthetized
open
chest
dogs
.

The
ventricular
fibrillation
threshold
was
measured
by
passing
a
gated
train
of
12
constant
current
pulses
through
the
ventricular
myocardium
during
the
vulnerable
period
of
the
cardiac
cycle
.

During
the
infusion
of
aminophylline
,
the
ventricular
fibrillation
threshold
was
reduced
by
30
to
40
percent
of
the
control
when
pH
and
partial
pressures
of
oxygen

(
PO2
)
and
carbon
dioxide

(
CO2
)
were
kept
within
normal
limits
.

When
respiratory
failure
was
produced
by
hypoventilation

(
pH
7.05
to
7.25
;
PC02

70
to
100
mm
Hg
:
P02
20
to
40
mm
Hg
)
,

infusion
of
aminophylline
resulted
in
an
even
greater
decrease
in
ventricular
fibrillation
threshold
to
60
percent
of
the
control
level
.

These
experiments
suggest
that
although
many
factors
may
contribute
to
the
increased
incidence
of
ventricular
arrhythmias
in
respiratory
failure
,
pharmacologic
agents
,
particularly
aminophylline
,
may
play
a
significant
role
.

Case
report
:
acute
unintentional
carbachol
intoxication
.

INTRODUCTION
:
Intoxications
with
carbachol
,
a
muscarinic
cholinergic
receptor
agonist

are
rare
.

We
report
an
interesting
case
investigating
a
(
near
)
fatal
poisoning
.

METHODS
:

The
son
of
an
84-year
-
old
male
discovered
a
newspaper
report
stating
clinical
success
with
plant
extracts
in
Alzheimer
's
disease
.

The
mode
of
action
was
said
to
be
comparable
to
that
of
the
synthetic
compound
'
carbamylcholin
'
;
that
is
,
carbachol
.

He
bought
25
g
of
carbachol
as
pure
substance
in
a
pharmacy
,
and
the
father
was
administered
400
to
500
mg
.

Carbachol
concentrations
in
serum
and
urine
on
day
1
and
2
of
hospital
admission
were
analysed
by
HPLC
-
mass
spectrometry
.

RESULTS
:

Minutes
after
oral
administration
,
the
patient
developed
nausea
,
sweating
and
hypotension
,
and
finally
collapsed
.

Bradycardia
,
cholinergic
symptoms
and
asystole
occurred
.

Initial
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
and
immediate
treatment
with
adrenaline

(
epinephrine
)
,

atropine
and
furosemide
was
successful
.

On
hospital
admission
,
blood
pressure
of
the
intubated
,
bradyarrhythmic
patient
was
100/65
mmHg
.

Further
signs
were
hyperhidrosis
,
hypersalivation
,
bronchorrhoea
,
and
severe
miosis
;
the
electrocardiographic
finding
was
atrio
-
ventricular
dissociation
.

High
doses
of
atropine
(
up
to
50
mg
per
24
hours
)
,
adrenaline
and
dopamine
were
necessary
.

The
patient
was
extubated
1
week
later
.

However
,
increased
dyspnoea
and
bronchospasm
necessitated
reintubation
.

Respiratory
insufficiency
was
further
worsened
by
Proteus
mirabilis
infection
and
severe
bronchoconstriction
.

One
week
later
,
the
patient
was
again
extubated
and
3
days
later
was
transferred
to
a
peripheral
ward
.

On
the
next
day
he
died
,
probably
as
a
result
of
heart
failure
.

Serum
samples
from
the
first
and
second
days
contained
3.6
and
1.9
mg
/
l
carbachol
,
respectively
.

The
corresponding
urine
concentrations
amounted
to
374
and
554
mg

/
l

.
CONCLUSION
:

This
case
started
with
a
media
report
in
a
popular
newspaper
,
initiated
by
published
,
peer
-
reviewed
research
on
herbals
,
and
involved
human
failure
in
a
case
history
,
medical
examination
and
clinical
treatment
.

For
the
first
time
,
an
analytical
method
for
the
determination
of
carbachol
in

by
a

Especially
in

intensivists
should
consider
intoxications

Crossover
comparison
of
efficacy
and
preference
for
rizatriptan

10
mg
versus
ergotamine
/
caffeine
in

migraine
.

Rizatriptan
is
a
selective
5-HT
(
1B/1D
)
receptor
agonist
with
rapid
oral
absorption
and
early
onset
of
action
in
the
acute
treatment
of
migraine
.

This
randomized
double-
blind
crossover
outpatient
study
assessed
the
preference
for
1
rizatriptan
10
mg
tablet
to
2
ergotamine
1
mg/
caffeine
100
mg
tablets
in
439
patients
treating
a
single
migraine
attack
with
each
therapy
.

Of
patients
expressing
a
preference
(
89.1
%
)
,
more
than
twice
as
many
preferred
rizatriptan
to
ergotamine
/
caffeine
(
69.9
vs.
30.1
%
,
p
or
=
0.001
)
.

Faster
relief
of
headache
was
the
most
important
reason
for
preference
,
cited
by
67.3
%
of
patients
preferring
rizatriptan
and
54.2
%
of
patients
who
preferred
ergotamine
/
caffeine
.

The
co
-
primary
endpoint
of
being
pain
free
at
2
h
was
also
in
favor
of
rizatriptan
.

Forty
-
nine
percent
of
patients
were
pain

free
2
h
after
rizatriptan
,
compared
with
24.3
%
treated
with
ergotamine
/
caffeine

(
p
or
=
0.001
)
,
rizatriptan
being
superior
within
1
h
of
treatment
.

Headache
relief
at
2
h
was
75.9
%
for
rizatriptan
and
47.3
%
for
ergotamine
/
caffeine

(
p
or
=
0.001
)
,
with
rizatriptan
being
superior
to
ergotamine
/
caffeine
within
30
min
of
dosing
.

Almost
36
%
of
patients
taking
rizatriptan
were
pain

free
at
2
h
and
had
no
recurrence
or
need
for
additional
medication
within
24
h
,
compared
to
20
%
of
patients
on
ergotamine
/
caffeine

(
p
or
=
0.001
)
.

Rizatriptan
was
also
superior
to
ergotamine
/
caffeine
in
the
proportions
of
patients
with
no
nausea
,
vomiting
,
phonophobia
or
photophobia
and
for
patients
with
normal
function
2
h
after
drug
intake
(
p
or
=
0.001
)
.

More
patients
were
(
completely
,
very
or
somewhat
)
satisfied
2
h
after
treatment
with
rizatriptan

(
69.8
%
)
than
at
2
h
after
treatment
with
ergotamine
/
caffeine

(
38.6
%
,
p
or
=
0.001
)
.

Recurrence
rates
were
31.4
%
with
rizatriptan
and
15.3
%
with
ergotamine
/
caffeine
.

Both
active
treatments
were
well
tolerated
.

The
most
common
adverse
events
(
incidence
>
or
=
5
%
in
one
group
)
after
rizatriptan
and
ergotamine
/
caffeine
,
respectively
,
were
dizziness

(
6.7
and
5.3
%
)
,

nausea
(
4.2
and
8.5
%
)
and
somnolence
(
5.5
and

)
.

Thrombotic
microangiopathy
and
renal
failure
associated
with
antineoplastic
chemotherapy
.

Five
patients
with
carcinoma
developed

thrombotic
microangiopathy
(
characterized
by
renal
insufficiency
,
microangiopathic
hemolytic
anemia
,
and
usually
thrombocytopenia
)
after
treatment
with
cisplatin
,
bleomycin
,
and
a
vinca
alkaloid
.

One
patient
had
thrombotic
thrombocytopenic
purpura
,
three
the
hemolytic
-
uremic
syndrome
,
and
one
an
apparent
forme
fruste
of
one
of
these
disorders
.

Histologic
examination
of
the
renal
tissue
showed
evidence
of
intravascular
coagulation
,
primarily
affecting
the
small
arteries
,
arterioles
,
and
glomeruli
.

Because
each
patient
was

tumor
-free
or

had
only
a
small
tumor
at
the
onset
of
this
syndrome
,
the
thrombotic
microangiopathy
may
have
been
induced
by
chemotherapy
.

Diagnosis
of
this
potentially
fatal
complication
may
be
delayed
or
missed
if
renal
tissue
or
the
peripheral
blood
smear
is
not
examined
,
because
renal
failure
may
be
ascribed
to
cisplatin
nephrotoxicity
and
the
anemia
and
thrombocytopenia
to
drug
-
induced
bone
marrow
suppression
.

Salvage
therapy
with
nelarabine
,
etoposide
,
and
cyclophosphamide
in
relapsed
/
refractory
paediatric
T
-
cell
lymphoblastic
leukaemia
and
lymphoma
.

A
combination
of
5
d
of
nelarabine

(
AraG
)
with
5
d
of
etoposide

(
VP
)
and
cyclophosphamide

(
CPM
)
and
prophylactic
intrathecal
chemotherapy
was
used
as
salvage
therapy
in
seven
children
with
refractory
or
relapsed
T
-
cell
leukaemia
or
lymphoma
.

The
most
common
side
effects
attributable
to
the
AraG
included
Grade
2
and
3
sensory
and
motor
neuropathy
and
musculoskeletal
pain
.

Haematological
toxicity
was
greater
for
the
combination
than
AraG
alone
,
although
median
time
to
neutrophil
and
platelet
recovery
was
consistent
with
other
salvage
therapies
.

All
patients
had
some
response
to
the
combined
therapy
and
five
of
the
seven
went
into
complete
remission
after
one
or
two
courses
of
AraG
/
VP
/
CPM
.

Our
experience
supports
the
safety
of
giving
AraG
as
salvage
therapy
in
synchrony
with
etoposide
and
cyclophosphamide
,
although
neurological
toxicity
must
be
closely
monitored
.

The
3-week
sulphasalazine
syndrome
strikes
again
.

A
34-year
-
old
lady
developed
a
constellation
of
dermatitis
,
fever
,

lymphadenopathy
and
hepatitis
,
beginning
on
the
17th
day
of
a
course
of
oral
sulphasalazine
for
sero
-
negative
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Cervical
and
inguinal
lymph
node
biopsies
showed
the
features
of
severe
necrotising
lymphadenitis
,
associated
with
erythrophagocytosis
and
prominent
eosinophilic
infiltrates
,
without
viral
inclusion
bodies
,
suggestive
of
an
adverse
drug
reaction
.A

week
later
,
fulminant
drug
-
induced
hepatitis
,
associated
with
the
presence
of
anti
-
nuclear
autoantibodies
(
but
not
with
other
markers
of
autoimmunity
)
,
and
accompanied
by
multi
-
organ
failure
and
sepsis
,
supervened
.

She
subsequently
died
some
5
weeks
after
the
commencement
of
her
drug
therapy
.

Post
-
mortem
examination
showed
evidence
of
massive
hepatocellular
necrosis
,
acute
hypersensitivity
myocarditis
,
focal
acute
tubulo
-
interstitial
nephritis
and
extensive
bone
marrow
necrosis
,
with
no
evidence
of
malignancy
.

It
is
thought
that
the
clinico
-
pathological
features
and
chronology
of
this
case
bore
the
hallmarks
of
the
so
-
called
"
3-week
sulphasalazine
syndrome
"
,
a
rare
,
but
often
fatal
,
immunoallergic
reaction
to
sulphasalazine
.

Bupropion
(
Zyban
)
toxicity
.

Bupropion
is
a
monocyclic
antidepressant
structurally
related
to
amphetamine
.

Zyban
,
a
sustained
-
release
formulation
of
bupropion
hydrochloride
,
was
recently
released
in
Ireland
,
as
a
smoking
cessation
aid
.

In
the
initial
6
months
since
it
's
introduction
,
12
overdose
cases
have
been
reported
to
The
National
Poisons
Information
Centre
.

8
patients
developed
symptoms
of
toxicity
.

Common
features
included
tachycardia
,
drowsiness
,
hallucinations
and
convulsions
.

Two
patients
developed
severe
cardiac
arrhythmias
,
including
one
patient
who
was
resuscitated
following
a
cardiac
arrest
.

All
patients
recovered
without
sequelae
.

We
report
a
case
of
a
31
year
old
female
who
required
admission
to
the
Intensive
Care
Unit
for
ventilation
and
full
supportive
therapy
,
following
ingestion
of
13.5
g
bupropion
.

Recurrent
seizures
were
treated
with
diazepam
and
broad
complex
tachycardia
was
successfully
treated
with
adenosine
.

Zyban
caused
significant
neurological
and
cardiovascular
toxicity
in
overdose
.

The
potential
toxic
effects
should
be
considered
when
prescribing
it
as
a
smoking
cessation
aid
.

Survey
of
complications
of
indocyanine
green
angiography
in
Japan
.

PURPOSE
:

We
evaluated
the
safety
of
indocyanine
green
for
use
in
fundus
angiography
.

METHODS
:

We
sent
a
questionnaire
concerning
complications
of
indocyanine
green
to
32
institutions
in
Japan
,
which
were
selected
on
the
basis
of
the
client
list
from
the
Topcon
Company
,
which
manufactures
the
indocyanine
green
fundus
camera
.

RESULTS
:

Ophthalmologists
at
15
institutions
responded
,
reporting
a
total
of
3,774
indocyanine
green
angiograms
performed
on
2,820
patients
between
June
1984
and
September
1992
.

Before
angiography
,
intradermal
or
intravenous
indocyanine
green
testing
,
or
both
was
performed
at
13
of
15
institutions
.

For
three
patients
,
the
decision
was
made
not
to
proceed
with
angiography
after
positive
preangiographic
testing
.

The
dosage
of
indocyanine
green
used
for
angiography
varied
from
25
to
75
mg
,
depending
upon
the
institution
.

There
were
13
cases
of
adverse
reactions
(
0.34
%
)
,
ten
of
which
were
mild
reactions
such
as
nausea
,
exanthema
,
urtication
,
itchiness
,
and
urgency
to
defecate
,
and
did
not
require
treatment
.

Also
recorded
were
one
case
of
pain
of
the
vein
,
which
required
treatment
,
and
two
cases
of
hypotension
.

The
two
hypotensive
patients
required
treatment
for
shock
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

A
comparison
of
frequency
of
adverse
reactions
to
indocyanine
green
with
the
previously
reported
frequency
of
such
reactions
to
fluorescein
sodium
indicated
that
indocyanine
green
is
a
safe
as
fluorescein
for
use
in
angiography
.

)
respectively
,
in
model
of
diabetic
(
streptozotocin
-
induced
)
and
toxic
(
vincristine
-
induced
)
neuropathy
was
investigated
.

METHODS
:

The
changes
in
pain
thresholds
were
determined
using
mechanical
stimuli
--
the
modification
of
the
classic
paw
withdrawal
test
described
by
Randall
-
Selitto
.

RESULTS
:

The
results
of
this
paper
confirm
that
inhibition
of
bradykinin
receptors
and
inducible
NO
synthase
but
not
neuronal
NO
synthase
activity
reduces
diabetic
hyperalgesia
.

Pretreatment
with
L
-
NOArg
and
L
-
NIL
but
not
7-NI
,
significantly
increases
antihyperalgesic
activity
both
HOE
140
and
des
Arg10
HOE
140
.

It
was
also
shown
that
both
products
of
inducible
NO
synthase
and
neuronal
NO

synthase
activation
as
well
as
bradykinin
are
involved
in
hyperalgesia
produced
by
vincristine
.

Moreover
,
L
-
NOArg
and
7-NI
but
not
L
-
NIL
intensify
antihyperalgesic
activity
of
HOE
140
or
des
-
Arg10HOE
140
in
toxic
neuropathy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Results
of
these
studies
suggest
that
B1
and
B2
receptors
are
engaged
in
transmission
of
nociceptive
stimuli
in
both
diabetic
and
toxic
neuropathy
.

In
streptozotocin
-induced
hyperalgesia
,
inducible
NO
synthase
participates
in
pronociceptive
activity
of
bradykinin
,
whereas
in
vincristine
-induced
hyperalgesia
bradykinin
seemed
to
activate
neuronal
NO
synthase
pathway
.

Therefore
,
concomitant
administration
of
small
doses
of
bradykinin
receptor
antagonists
and
NO
synthase
inhibitors
can
be
effective
in
alleviation
of
neuropathic
pain
,
even
in
hospital
care
.

Cardiac
toxicity
observed
in
association
with
high
-
dose
cyclophosphamide
-based
chemotherapy
for
metastatic
breast
cancer
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Cyclophosphamide
is
an
alkylating
agent
given
frequently
as
a
component
of
many
conditioning
regimens
.

In
high
doses
,
its
nonhematological
dose
-
limiting
toxicity
is
cardiomyopathy
.

STUDY
DESIGN
:

We
combined

paclitaxel
,
melphalan
and
high
-
dose
cyclophosphamide
,
thiotepa
,
and
carboplatin
in
a
triple
sequential
high
-
dose
regimen
for
patients
with
metastatic
breast
cancer
.

Analysis
was
performed
on
61
women
with
chemotherapy
-
responsive
metastatic
breast
cancer
receiving
96-h
infusional
cyclophosphamide
as
part
of
a
triple
sequential
high
-
dose
regimen
to
assess
association
between
presence
of
peritransplant
congestive
heart
failure

(
CHF
)
and
the
following
pretreatment
characteristics
:
presence
of
electrocardiogram
(
EKG
)
abnormalities
,
age
,
hypertension
,
prior
cardiac
history
,
smoking
,
diabetes
mellitus
,
prior
use
of
anthracyclines
,
and
left
-
sided
chest
irradiation
.

RESULTS
:

Six
of
61
women
(
10
%
)
developed
clinically
reversible
grade
3

CHF
following
infusional
cyclophosphamide
with
a
median
percent
decline
in
ejection
fraction
of
31
%
.

Incidence
of
transient
cyclophosphamide
-related
cardiac
toxicity
(
10
%
)
is
comparable
to
previous
recorded
literature
.

Older
age
was
significantly
correlated
with
the
CHF
development
;
with
median
ages
for
the
entire
group
and
for
patients
developing
CHF
of
45
and
59
,
respectively
.

No
association
was
found
with
other
pretreatment
characteristics
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

As
a
result
of
these
findings
,
oncologists
should
carefully
monitor
fluid
balance
in
older
patients
.

Routine
EKG
monitoring
during
infusional
cyclophosphamide
did
not
predict
CHF
development
.

Inappropriate
use
of
carbamazepine
and
vigabatrin
in
typical
absence
seizures
.

Carbamazepine
and
vigabatrin
are
contraindicated
in
typical
absence
seizures
.

Of
18
consecutive
referrals
of
children
with
resistant
typical
absences
only
,
eight
were
erroneously
treated
with
carbamazepine
either
as
monotherapy
or
as
an
add
-
on
.

Vigabatrin
was
also
used
in
the
treatment
of
two
children
.

Frequency
of
absences
increased
in
four
children
treated
with
carbamazepine
and
two
of
these
developed
myoclonic
jerks
,
which
resolved
on
withdrawal
of
carbamazepine
.

Absences
were
aggravated
in
both
cases
where
vigabatrin
was
added
on
to
concurrent
treatment
.

Optimal
control
of
the
absences
was
achieved
with
sodium
valproate
,
lamotrigine
,
or
ethosuximide
alone
or
in
combination
.

Hemolytic
anemia
associated
with
the
use
of
omeprazole
.

Omeprazole
is
the
first
drug
designed
to
block
the
final
step
in
the
acid
secretory
process
within
the
parietal
cell
.

It
has
been
shown
to
be
extremely
effective
in
the
treatment
of
peptic
ulcer
disease
,
reflux
esophagitis
,
and
the
Zollinger
-
Ellison
syndrome
.

Although
clinical
experience
with
omeprazole
is
still
limited
,
many
controlled
studies
have
established
the
short
-
term
safety
of
this
drug
.

We
report
the
first
case
of
a
serious
short
-
term
adverse
reaction
with
the
use
of
omeprazole
:
hemolytic
anemia
.

The
patient
developed
weakness
,
lethargy
,
and
shortness
of
breath
2
days
after
starting
therapy
with
omeprazole
.

Two
weeks
after
the
initiation
of
therapy
,
her
hematocrit
had
decreased
from
44.1
%
to
20.4
%
,
and
she
had
a
positive
direct
Coombs
antiglobulin
test
and
an
elevated
indirect
bilirubin
.

After
she
discontinued
the
omeprazole
,
her
hemoglobin
and
hematocrit
gradually
returned
to
normal
.

The
mechanism
by
which
omeprazole
caused
the
patient
's
hemolytic
anemia
is
uncertain
,
but
physicians
should
be
alerted
to
this
possible
adverse
effect
.

Seventy
patients
developed
major

infections
whilst
on
therapy
;
this
was
the
first
AIDS
diagnosis
in
17
.

Only
minor
changes
in

were
observed
in

,
although
a
more

occurred
in

.

Of
those
positive
for
p24
antigen
at
the
commencement
of
the
study
67
%
showed
a
positive
response
,
and
this
was
most
likely
in
those
with

.

A

.

Most
patients
showed
improvement
in
individual
parameters
and

.

Adverse
reactions
possibly
attributable
to
didanosine
were
common
.

The
most

was
diarrhoea
,
which
resulted
in

in
19
individuals
.

Peripheral

.

Thirteen

these
were

Can
angiogenesis
be
a
target
of
treatment
for
ribavirin

associated
hemolytic
anemia
?

BACKGROUND
/
AIMS
:

Recently
ribavirin
has
been
found
to
inhibit
angiogenesis
and
a
number
of
angiogenesis
inhibitors
such
as
sunitinib
and
sorafenib
have
been
found
to
cause
acute
hemolysis
.

We
aimed
to
investigate
whether
there
is
a
relation
between
hemoglobin
,
haptoglobin
and
angiogenesis
soluble
markers
which
are
modifiable
and
can
help
in
developing
strategies
against
anemia
.

METHODS
:
Fourteen
patients

chronically
infected
with
hepatitis
C
virus
were
treated
by
pegylated
interferon
alpha
2a
and
ribavirin
.

Serum
hemoglobin
,
haptoglobin
and
angiogenesis
markers
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
and
angiopoetin-2
were
investigated
before
and
after
therapy
.

RESULTS
:

We
observed
a
significant
decrease
in
haptoglobin
levels
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
period
.

Hemoglobin
levels
also
decreased
but
insignificantly
by
treatment
.

In
contrast
with
the
literature
,
serum
levels
of
angiogenesis
factors
did
not
change
significantly
by
pegylated
interferon
and
ribavirin
therapy
.

We
found
no
correlation
of
angiogenesis
soluble
markers
with
either
hemoglobin
or
haptoglobin
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
is
the
first
study
in
the
literature
investigating
a
link
between
angiogenesis
soluble
markers
and
ribavirin
induced
anemia
in
patients
with
hepatitis
C

and
we
could
not
find
any
relation
.

Future
research
with
larger
number
of
patients
is
needed
to
find
out
modifiable
factors
that
will
improve
the
safety
of
ribavirin
therapy
.

Cocaine
causes
memory
and
learning
impairments
in
rats
:
involvement
of
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
and
oxidative
stress
,
and
prevention
by
topiramate
.

Different
mechanisms
have
been
suggested
for
cocaine
toxicity
including
an
increase
in
oxidative
stress
but
the
association
between
oxidative
status
in
the
brain
and
cocaine
induced
-
behaviour
is
poorly
understood
.

Nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NFkappaB
)
is
a
sensor
of
oxidative
stress
and
participates
in
memory
formation
that
could
be
involved
in
drug
toxicity
and
addiction
mechanisms
.

Therefore
NFkappaB
activity
,
oxidative
stress
,
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
nNOS
)
activity
,
spatial
learning
and
memory
as
well
as
the
effect
of
topiramate
,
a
previously
proposed
therapy
for
cocaine
addiction
,
were
evaluated
in
an
experimental
model
of
cocaine
administration
in
rats
.

NFkappaB
activity
was
decreased
in
the
frontal
cortex
of

cocaine
treated
rats
,
as
well
as
GSH
concentration
and
glutathione
peroxidase
activity
in
the
hippocampus
,
whereas
nNOS
activity
in
the
hippocampus
was
increased
.

Memory
retrieval
of
experiences
acquired
prior
to
cocaine
administration
was
impaired
and
negatively
correlated
with
NFkappaB
activity
in
the
frontal
cortex
.

In
contrast
,
learning
of
new
tasks
was
enhanced
and
correlated
with
the
increase
of
nNOS
activity
and
the
decrease
of
glutathione
peroxidase
.

These
results
provide
evidence
for
a
possible
mechanistic
role
of
oxidative
and
nitrosative
stress
and
NFkappaB
in
the
alterations
induced
by
cocaine
.

Topiramate

the
alterations

Hyperbaric
oxygen
therapy
for
control
of
intractable
cyclophosphamide
-induced

.

We
report
a
case
of
intractable
hemorrhagic
cystitis
due
to
cyclophosphamide
therapy
for
Wegener
's
granulomatosis
.

Conservative
treatment
,
including
bladder
irrigation
with
physiological
saline
and
instillation
of
prostaglandin
F2
alpha
,
failed
to
totally
control
hemorrhage
.

We
then
used
hyperbaric
oxygen
at
an
absolute
pressure
of
2
atm
,
5
days
a
week
for
8
consecutive
weeks
.

The
bleeding
ceased
completely
by
the
end
of
treatment
and
the
patient
remained
free
of
hematuria
thereafter
.

No
side
effect
was
noted
during
the
course
of
therapy
.

In
future
,
this
form
of
therapy
can
offer
a
safe
alternative
in
the
treatment
of
cyclophosphamide

-induced
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

Further
studies
on
the
effects
of
certain

Clinical
experiences
in
an
open
and
a
double
-
blind
trial
.

A
total
of
sixty
patients
were
trated
with
bromperidol
first
in
open
conditions

(
20
patients
)
,
then
on
a
double
blind
basis
(
40
patients
)
with
haloperidol
as
the
reference
substance
.

The
open
study
lasted
for
four
weeks
;
the
drug
was
administrated
in
the
form
of
1
mg
tablets
.

The
daily
dose
(
initial
dose
:
1
mg
;
mean
dose
at
the
end
of
the
trial
:
4.47
mg
)
was
always
administered
in
one
single
dose
.

Nineteen
patients
finished
the
trial
,
and
in
18
cases
the
therapeutic
result
was
considered
very
good
to
good
.

These
results
were
confirmed
by
statistical
analysis
.

Nine
patients
exhibited
mild
to
moderate
extrapyramidal
concomitant
symptoms
;
no
other
side
effects
were
observed
.

The
results
of
detailed
laboratory
tests
and
evaluations
of
various
quantitative
and
qualitative
tolerability
parameters
were
not
indicative
of
toxic
effects
.

In
the
double
blind
study
with
haloperidol
,
both
substances
were
found
to
be
highly
effective
in
the
treatment
of
psychotic
syndromes
belonging
predominantly
to
the
schizophrenia
group
.

Certain
clues
,
including

Curcumin
ameliorates

cognitive
dysfunction
and
oxidative
damage
in
phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
administered
rats
.

The
antiepileptic
drugs
,
phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
are
well
known
to
cause
cognitive
impairment
on
chronic
use
.

The
increase
in
free
radical
generation
has
been
implicated
as
one
of
the
important
mechanisms
of
cognitive
impairment
by
antiepileptic
drugs
.

Curcumin
has
shown
antioxidant
,
anti
-
inflammatory
and
neuro
-
protective
properties
.

Therefore
,
the
present
study
was
carried
out
to
investigate
the
effect
of
chronic
curcumin
administration
on
phenobarbitone
-
and
carbamazepine
-induced

cognitive
impairment
and
oxidative
stress
in
rats
.

Pharmacokinetic
interactions
of
curcumin
with
phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
were
also
studied
.

Vehicle
/
drugs
were
administered
daily
for
21days
to
male
Wistar
rats
.

Passive
avoidance
paradigm
and
elevated
plus
maze
test
were
used
to
assess
cognitive
function
.

At
the
end
of
study
period
,
serum

phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
,
whole
brain
malondialdehyde
and
reduced
glutathione
levels
were
estimated
.

The
administration
of
phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
for
21days
caused
a
significant
impairment
of
learning
and
memory
as
well
as
an
increased
oxidative
stress
.

Concomitant
curcumin
administration
prevented
the
cognitive
impairment
and
decreased
the
increased
oxidative
stress
induced
by
these
antiepileptic
drugs
.

Curcumin
co
-
administration
did
not
cause
any
significant
alteration
in
the
serum
concentrations
of
both
phenobarbitone
as
well
as
carbamazepine
.

These
results
show
that
curcumin
has
beneficial
effect
in
mitigating
the
deterioration
of
cognitive
functions
and
oxidative
damage
in
rats
treated
with
phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
without
significantly
altering
their
serum
concentrations
.

The
findings
suggest
that
curcumin
can
be
considered
as
a
potential
safe
and
effective
adjuvant
to
phenobarbitone
and
carbamazepine
therapy
in
preventing
cognitive
impairment
associated
with
these
drugs
.

Pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate
protects
the
piriform
cortex
in
the
pilocarpine
status
epilepticus
model
.

Pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate

(
PDTC
)
has
a
dual
mechanism
of
action
as
an
antioxidant
and
an
inhibitor
of
the
transcription
factor
kappa
-
beta
.

Both
,
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
as
well
as
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
have
been
implicated
in
severe
neuronal
damage
in
different
sub
-
regions
of
the
hippocampus
as
well
as
in
the
surrounding
cortices
.

The
effect
of
PDTC
on
status
epilepticus
-associated
cell
loss
in
the
hippocampus
and
piriform
cortex
was
evaluated
in
the
rat
fractionated
pilocarpine
model
.

Treatment
with
150
mg
/
kg
PDTC
before
and
following

status
epilepticus
significantly
increased
the
mortality
rate
to
100
%
.

Administration
of
50
mg
/
kg
PDTC

(
low
-
dose
)
did
not
exert
major
effects
on
the
development
of
a
status
epilepticus
or
the
mortality
rate
.

In
vehicle
-
treated
rats
,
status
epilepticus
caused
pronounced

neuronal
damage
in
the
piriform
cortex
comprising
both
pyramidal
cells
and
interneurons
.

Low
-
dose
PDTC
treatment
almost
completely
protected
from
lesions
in
the
piriform
cortex
.

A
significant
decrease
in
neuronal
density
of
the
hippocampal
hilar
formation
was
identified
in
vehicle-
and
PDTC
-treated
rats
following
status
epilepticus
.

In
conclusion
,
the
NF
-
kappaB
inhibitor
and
antioxidant
PDTC
protected
the
piriform
cortex
,
whereas
it
did
not
affect
hilar
neuronal
loss
.

These
data
might
indicate
that
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
and
activation
of
NF
-
kappaB
plays
a
more
central
role
in
seizure

-associated

neuronal
damage
in
the
temporal
cortex
as
compared
to
the
hippocampal
hilus
.

However
,
future
investigations
are
necessary
to
exactly
analyze
the
biochemical
mechanisms
by
which
PDTC
exerted
its
beneficial
effects
in
the
piriform
cortex
.

Fewer

The
majority
of
patients
(

)
experienced
no

CONCLUSION
:

The

Development
of
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
in
parkinsonian
monkeys
may
depend
upon
rate
of
symptom
onset
and/or
duration
of
symptoms
.

Levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias

(
LIDs
)
present
a
major
problem
for
the
long
-
term
management
of
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
patients
.

Due
to
the
interdependence
of
risk
factors
in
clinical
populations
,
it
is
difficult
to
independently
examine
factors
that
may
influence
the
development
of
LIDs
.

Using
macaque
monkeys
with
different
types
of
MPTP

-induced

parkinsonism
,
the
current
study
evaluated
the
degree
to
which
rate
of
symptom
progression
,
symptom
severity
,
and
response
to
and
duration
of
levodopa
therapy
may
be
involved
in
the
development
of
LIDs
.

Monkeys
with
acute
(
short
-
term
)

MPTP
exposure
,
rapid
symptom
onset
and
short
symptom
duration
prior
to
initiation
of
levodopa
therapy
developed

dyskinesia
between
11
and
24
days
of
daily
levodopa
administration
.

In
contrast
,
monkeys
with
long
-
term
MPTP
exposure
,
slow
symptom
progression
and/or
long
symptom
duration
prior
to
initiation
of
levodopa
therapy
were
more
resistant
to
developing
LIDs

(
e.g.
,
dyskinesia
developed
no
sooner
than
146
days
of
chronic
levodopa
administration
)
.

All
animals
were
similarly
symptomatic
at
the
start
of
levodopa
treatment
and
had
similar
therapeutic
responses
to
the
drug
.

These
data
suggest
distinct
differences
in
the
propensity
to
develop
LIDs
in
monkeys
with
different
rates
of
symptom
progression
or
symptom
durations
prior
to
levodopa
and
demonstrate
the
value
of
these
models
for
further
studying
the
pathophysiology
of
LIDs
.

Propylthiouracil
-induced
perinuclear
-
staining
antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
autoantibody
-
positive
vasculitis
in
conjunction
with
pericarditis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
a
case
of
propylthiouracil
-induced
vasculitis
manifesting
with
pericarditis
.

METHODS
:

We
present
the
first
case
report
of
a
woman
with
hyperthyroidism
treated
with
propylthiouracil
in
whom
a
syndrome
of
pericarditis
,
fever
,
and
glomerulonephritis
developed
.

Serologic
testing
and
immunologic
studies
were
done
,
and
a
pericardial
biopsy
was
performed
.

RESULTS
:

A
25-year
-
old
woman
with
Graves
'
disease
had
a
febrile
illness
and
evidence
of
pericarditis
,
which
was
confirmed
by
biopsy
.

Serologic
evaluation
revealed
the
presence
of
perinuclear
-
staining
antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
autoantibodies
(
pANCA
)
against
myeloperoxidase
(
MPO
)
.

Propylthiouracil
therapy
was
withdrawn
,
and
she
was
treated
with
a
1-month
course
of
prednisone
,
which
alleviated
her
symptoms
.

A
literature
review
revealed
no
prior
reports
of
pericarditis
in
anti
-
MPO
pANCA
-
positive
vasculitis
associated
with
propylthio-
uracil
therapy
.

CONCLUSION
:

Pericarditis
may
be
the
initial
manifestation
of
drug
-
induced
vasculitis
attributable
to
propylthio-
uracil
therapy
.

Two

are
also
differentially
sensitive
to
various
pharmacological

.

Two
mouse
lines
were
selectively
bred
according
to
their

)
or
resistance
(

)
to
seizures
induced
by
a

)
,
an
inverse

)
receptor
benzodiazepine
site
.

Our
aim
was
to
characterize
both
lines
'
sensitivities
to
various
physiological
effects
of
other
ligands
of
the
GABA
(
A
)
receptor
.

We
measured

diazepam
-induced

anxiolysis
with
the
elevated
plus
-
maze
test
,
diazepam
-induced
sedation
by
recording
the
vigilance
states
,
and
picrotoxin
-
and
pentylenetetrazol
-induced
seizures
after
i.p
.
injections
.

Results
presented
here
show
that
the
differential
sensitivities
of
BS
and
BR
lines
to
beta
-
CCM
can
be
extended
to
diazepam
,
picrotoxin
,
and
pentylenetetrazol
,
suggesting
a
genetic
selection
of
a
general
sensitivity
and
resistance
to
several
ligands
of
the
GABA
(
A
)
receptor
.

Analgesic

patients
on

therapy
:
a
randomized
,

study
.

Pain
not
responsive
to
morphine
is
often
problematic
.

Animal
and
clinical
studies
have
suggested
that
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
antagonists
,
such
as
ketamine
,
may
be
effective
in
improving
opioid
analgesia
in
difficult
pain
syndromes
,
such
as
neuropathic
pain
.

A
slow
bolus
of
subhypnotic
doses
of
ketamine

(
0.25
mg
/
kg
or
0.50
mg
/
kg
)
was
given
to
10
cancer
patients
whose
pain
was
unrelieved
by
morphine
in
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
crossover
,
double
-
dose
study
.

Pain

on
a
0
to
10
numerical
scale
;
nausea
and
vomiting
,
drowsiness
,
confusion
,
and
dry

,
using
a
scale
from
0
to
3
(

)

;
Mini
-
Mental
State
Examination
(
MMSE
)
(
0
-
30
)
;
and
arterial
pressure
were
recorded
before
administration
of
drugs
(
T0
)
and
after
30
minutes
(
T30
)
,
60
minutes
(
T60
)
,
120
minutes
(
T120
)
,
and
180
minutes
(
T180
)
.

Ketamine
,
but
not
saline
solution
,
significantly
reduced
the
pain
intensity
in
almost
all
the
patients
at
both
doses
.

This
effect
was
more
relevant
in
patients
treated
with
higher
doses
.

Hallucinations
occurred
in
4
patients
,
and
an
unpleasant
sensation
(
"
empty
head
"
)
was
also
reported
by
2
patients
.

These
episodes
reversed
after
the
administration
of
diazepam

1
mg
intravenously
.

Significant
increases
in
drowsiness
were
reported
in
patients
treated
with
ketamine
in
both
groups
and
were
more
marked
with
ketamine
0.50
mg
/
kg
.

A
significant
difference
in
MMSE
was
observed
at
T30
in
patients
who
received
0.50
mg
/
kg
of
ketamine
.

Ketamine
can
improve
morphine

analgesia
in
difficult
pain
syndromes
,
such
as
neuropathic
pain
.

However
,
the
occurrence
of
central
adverse
effects
should
be
taken
into
account
,
especially
when
using
higher
doses
.

This
observation
should
be
tested
in
studies
of
prolonged
ketamine
administration
.

Endocrine
screening
in
1,022
men
with
erectile
dysfunction
:
clinical
significance
and
cost
-
effective
strategy
.

PURPOSE
:

We
reviewed
the
results
of
serum
testosterone
and
prolactin
determination
in
1,022
patients
referred
because
of
erectile
dysfunction
and
compared
the
data
with
history
,
results
of
physical
examination
,
other
etiological
investigations
and
effects
of
endocrine
therapy
to
refine
the
rules
of
cost
-
effective
endocrine
screening
and
to
pinpoint
actual
responsibility
for
hormonal
abnormalities
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

Testosterone
and
prolactin
were
determined
by
radioimmunoassay
.

Every
patient
was
screened
for
testosterone
and
451
were
screened
for
prolactin
on
the
basis
of

low
sexual
desire
,
gynecomastia
or
testosterone
less
than
4
ng./ml
.

Determination
was
repeated
in
case
of
abnormal
first
results
.

Prolactin
results
were
compared
with
those
of
a
previous
personal
cohort
of
1,340
patients
with
erectile
dysfunction
and
systematic
prolactin
determination
.

Main
clinical
criteria
tested
regarding
efficiency
in
hormone
determination
were

low
sexual
desire
,
small
testes
and
gynecomastia
.

Endocrine
therapy
consisted
of
testosterone
heptylate
or
human
chorionic
gonadotropin
for
hypogonadism
and
bromocriptine
for
hyperprolactinemia
.

RESULTS
:

Testosterone
was
less
than
3
ng./ml
.

in
107
patients
but
normal
in
40
%
at
repeat
determination
.

The
prevalence
of
repeatedly
low
testosterone
increased
with
age
(
4
%
before
age
50
years
and
9
%
50
years
or
older
)
.

Two
pituitary
tumors
were
discovered
after
testosterone
determination
.

Most
of
the
other
low
testosterone
levels
seemed
to
result
from
nonorganic
hypothalamic
dysfunction
because
of
normal
serum
luteinizing
hormone
and
prolactin
and
to
have
only
a
small
role
in
erectile
dysfunction

(
definite
improvement
in
only
16
of
44
[
36
%
]
after
androgen
therapy
,
normal
morning
or
nocturnal
erections
in
30
%
and
definite
vasculogenic
contributions
in
42
%
)
.

Determining
testosterone
only
in
cases
of
low
sexual
desire
or
abnormal
physical
examination
would
have
missed
40
%
of
the
cases
with
low
testosterone
,
including
37
%
of
those
subsequently
improved
by
androgen
therapy
.

Prolactin
exceeded
20
ng./ml
.

in
5
men
and
was
normal
in
2
at
repeat
determination
.

Only
1
prolactinoma
was
discovered
.

These
data
are
lower
than
those
we
found
during
the
last
2
decades
(
overall
prolactin
greater
than
20
ng./ml
.

in
1.86
%
of
1,821
patients
,
prolactinomas
in
7
,
0.38
%
)
.

Bromocriptine
was
definitely
effective
in
cases
with
prolactin
greater
than
35
ng./ml
.

(
8
of
12
compared
to
only
9
of
22
cases
with
prolactin
between
20
and
35
ng./ml
.
)
.

Testosterone
was
low
in
less
than
50
%
of
cases
with
prolactin
greater
than
35
ng./ml
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Low
prevalences
and
effects
of
low
testosterone
and
high
prolactin
in
erectile
dysfunction
can
not
justify
their
routine
determination
.

However
,
cost
-
effective
screening
strategies
recommended
so
far
missed
40
to
50
%
of
cases
improved
with
endocrine
therapy
and
the
pituitary
tumors
.

We
now
advocate
that
before
age
50
years

testosterone
be
determined
only
in
cases
of
low
sexual
desire
and
abnormal
physical
examination
but
that
it
be
measured
in
all
men
older
than
50
years
.

Prolactin
should
be
determined
only
in
cases
of

low
sexual
desire
,
gynecomastia
and/or
testosterone
less
than
4
ng./ml
.

Thiopentone
pretreatment
for
propofol
injection

pain
in
ambulatory
patients
.

This
study
investigated

propofol
injection
pain
in
patients
undergoing
ambulatory
anaesthesia
.

In
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
trial
,
90
women
were
allocated
to
receive
one
of
three
treatments
prior
to
induction
of
anaesthesia
with
propofol
.

Patients
in
Group
C
received
2
ml
normal
saline
,
Group
L
,
2
ml
,

lidocaine
2
%
(
40
mg
)
and
Group
T
,
2
ml

thiopentone
2.5
%
(
50
mg
)
.

Venous
discomfort
was
assessed
with
a
visual
analogue
scale
(
VAS
)
5
-
15
sec
after
commencing
propofol
administration
using
an
infusion
pump
(
rate
1000
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
)
.

Loss
of
consciousness
occurred
in
60
-
90
sec
.

Visual
analogue
scores
(
mean
+
/-
SD
)
during
induction
were
lower
in
Groups
L
(
3.3
+
/-

2.5
)
and
T
(
4.1
+
/-
2.7
)
than
in
Group
C
(
5.6
+
/-
2.3
)
;
P
=
0.0031
.

The
incidence
of
venous
discomfort
was
lower
in
Group
L
(
76.6
%
;
P
0.05
)
than
in
Group
C
(
100
%
)
but
not
different
from
Group
T
(
90
%
)
.

The
VAS
scores
for
recall
of
pain
in
the
recovery
room
were
correlated
with
the
VAS
scores
during
induction
(
r
=
0.7045
;
P
0.0001
)
.

Recovery
room
discharge
times
were
similar
:
C
(
75.9
+
/-

19.4
min
)
;
L
73.6
+
/-

21.6
min
)
;
T
(
77.1
+
/-

18.9
min
)
.

Assessing
their
overall
satisfaction
,
89.7
%
would
choose
propofol
anaesthesia
again
.

We
conclude
that
lidocaine
reduces
the
incidence
and
severity
of
propofol
injection

pain
in
ambulatory
patients
whereas
thiopentone
only
reduces
its
severity
.

immediately
before
the
induction
of
anaesthesia
,
to
prevent

arrhythmia
and
bradycardia
following
repeated
doses
of
suxamethonium
in
children
,
was
studied
.

A
control
group
was
included
for
comparison
with
the
lower
dose
range
of
glycopyrrolate
and
atropine
.

A
frequency
of
bradycardia
of
50
%
was
noted
in
the
control
group
,
but
this
was
not
significantly
different
from
the
frequency
with
the
active
drugs
.

Bradycardia
(
defined
as
a
decrease
in
heart
rate
to
less
than
50
beat
min-1
)
was
prevented
when
the
larger
dose
of
either
active
drug
was
used
.

It
is
recommended
that
either
glycopyrrolate

10
micrograms
kg-1
or
atropine

20
micrograms
kg-1
i.v
.

should
immediately
precede
induction
of

,
if
the
repeated

Reduction
in
caffeine

toxicity
by
acetaminophen
.

A
patient
who
allegedly
consumed
100
tablets
of
an
over
-
the
-
counter
analgesic
containing
sodium
acetylsalicylate
,
caffeine
,
and
acetaminophen
displayed
no
significant
CNS
stimulation
despite
the
presence
of
175
micrograms
of
caffeine
per
mL
of
serum
.

Because
salicylates
have
been
reported
to
augment
the
stimulatory
effects
of
caffeine
on
the
CNS
,
attention
was
focused
on
the
possibility
that
the
presence
of
acetaminophen

(
52
micrograms
/
mL
)
reduced
the
CNS
toxicity
of
caffeine
.

Studies
in
DBA/2J
mice
showed
that
:
1
)
pretreatment
with
acetaminophen

(
100
mg
/
kg
)
increased
the
interval
between
the
administration
of
caffeine

(
300
to
450
mg
/
kg
IP
)
and
the
onset
of
fatal
convulsions
by
a
factor
of
about
two
;
and
2
)
pretreatment
with
acetaminophen

(
75
mg
/
kg
)
reduced
the
incidence
of
audiogenic
seizures
produced
in
the
presence
of
caffeine
(
12.5
to
75
mg
/
kg
IP
)
.

The
frequency
of
sound
-
induced
seizures
after
12.5
or
25
mg
/
kg
caffeine
was
reduced
from
50
to
5
%
by
acetaminophen
.

In
the
absence
of
caffeine
,
acetaminophen
(
up
to
300
mg
/
kg
)
did
not
modify
the
seizures
induced
by
maximal
electroshock
and
did
not
alter
the
convulsant
dose
of
pentylenetetrezol
in
mice
(
tests
performed
by
the
Anticonvulsant
Screening
Project
of
NINCDS
)
.

Acetaminophen
(
up
to
150
micrograms
/
mL
)
did
not
retard
the
incorporation
of
radioactive
adenosine
into
ATP
in
slices
of
rat
cerebral
cortex
.

Thus
the
mechanism
by
which
acetaminophen
antagonizes
the
actions
of
caffeine
in
the
CNS
remains
unknown
.

.

Flestolol
is
metabolized
by
plasma
esterases
and
has
an
elimination
half

life
of
approximately
6.5
minutes
.

This
agent
was
well
tolerated
in
healthy
volunteers
at
doses
up
to
100
micrograms
/

.

In
long

,
flestolol
was
well
tolerated
at
the
effective
beta

dose
(
5
micrograms

)
for
up
to
seven
days
.

Flestolol
blood
concentrations
increased
linearly
with
increasing
dose
and
good
correlation
exists
between
blood
concentrations
of
flestolol
and
beta
-
adrenergic
blockade
.

Flestolol
produced
a
dose

dependent
attenuation
of
isoproterenol
-induced

tachycardia
.

Electrophysiologic
and
hemodynamic
effects
of
flestolol
are
similar
to
those
of
other
beta
blockers
.

In
contrast
with
other
beta
blockers
,
flestolol
-induced
effects
reverse
rapidly
(
within
30
minutes
)
following
discontinuation
because
of
its
short
half

life
.

Flestolol
effectively
reduced
heart
rate
in
patients
with
supraventricular
tachyarrhythmia
.

In
patients
with
unstable
angina
,
flestolol
infusion
was
found
to
be
safe
and
effective
in
controlling
chest

.

It
is
concluded
that
flestolol
is
a
potent
,
well

Treatment
of
tinnitus
by
intratympanic
instillation
of
lignocaine

(
lidocaine
)
2
per
cent
through
ventilation
tubes
.

Idiopathic
subjective
tinnitus

(
IST
)
is
one
of
the
most
obscure
otological
pathologies
.

This
paper
presents
the
results
of
treating
IST
by
intratympanic
instillation
of
lignocaine

(
lidocaine
)
2
per
cent
through
a
grommet
,
for
five
weekly
courses
.

Fifty
-
two
patients
suffering
from
intractable
tinnitus
entered
this
therapeutic
trial
,
but
only
nine
finished
all
five
courses
.

In
one
patient
,
the
tinnitus
was
almost
completely
abolished
,
but
in
all
the
nine
patients
the
decompensated
tinnitus
changed
to
a
compensated
one
.

We
suggest
this
mode
of
treatment
for
patients
that
were
previously
treated
by
drugs
,
acupuncture
and
biofeedback
,
with
disappointing
results
.

Patients
should
be
warned
about
the
side
effects
of
vertigo
and
vomiting
,
which
subsides
gradually
with
every
new
instillation
,
and
that
the
tinnitus
may
not
disappear
but
will
be
alleviated
,
enabling
them
to
cope
more
easily
with
the
disease
and
lead
a
more
normal
life
.

Perhexiline
maleate
and
peripheral
neuropathy
.

Peripheral
neuropathy
has
been
noted
as
a
complication
of
therapy
with
perhexiline
maleate
,
a
drug
widely
used
in
France
(
and
in
clinical
trials
in
the
United
States
)
for
the
prophylactic
treatment
of
angina
pectoris
.

In
24
patients
with
this
complication
,
the
marked
slowing
of
motor
nerve
conduction
velocity
and
the
electromyographic
changes
imply
mainly
a
demyelinating
disorder
.

Improvement
was
noted
with
cessation
of
therapy
.

In
a
few
cases
the
presence
of
active
denervation
signified
a
poor
prognosis
,
with
only
slight
improvement
.

The
underlying
mechanism
causing
the
neuropathy
is
not
yet
fully
known
,
although
some
evidence
indicates
that
it
may
be
a
lipid
storage
process
.

Effect
of
humoral
modulators
of
morphine
-induced

increase
in
locomotor
activity
of
mice
.

The
effect
of
humoral
modulators
on
the
morphine
-induced
increase
in
locomotor
activity
of
mice
was
studied
.

The
subcutaneous
administration
of
10
mg
/
kg
of
morphine
-HC1
produced
a
marked
increase
in
locomotor
activity
in
mice
.

The
morphine
-induced
hyperactivity
was
potentiated
by
scopolamine
and
attenuated
by
physostigmine
.

In
contrast
,
both
methscopolamine
and
neostigmine
,
which
do
not
penetrate
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
,
had
no
effect
on
the
hyperactivity
produced
by
morphine
.

Pretreatment
of
mice
with
alpha
-
methyltyrosine

(
20
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
,
one
hour
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
tyrosine
hydroxylase
,
significantly
decreased
the
activity
-
increasing
effects
of
morphine
.

On
the
other
hand
,
pretreatment
with
p
-
chlorophenylalamine

(
3
X
320
mg
/
kg
i.p
.

,
24
hr
)
,
a
serotonin
depletor
,
caused
no
significant
change
in
the
hyperactivity
.

The
study
suggests
that
the
activity
-
increasing
effects
of
morphine
are
mediated
by
the
release
of
catecholamines
from
adrenergic
neurons
in
the
brain
.

And
the
results
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
morphine
acts
by
retarding
the
release
of
acetylcholine
at
some
central
cholinergic
synapses
.

It
is
also
suggested
from
collected
evidence
that
the
activity
-
increasing
effects
of
morphine
in
mice
are
mediated
by
mechanisms
different
from
those
which
mediate
the
activity
-
increasing
effects
of
morphine
in
rats
.

Mechanisms
of
FK
506
-induced

hypertension
in
the
rat
.

-
Tacrolimus

(
FK
506
)
is
a
powerful
,
widely
used
immunosuppressant
.

The
clinical
utility
of
FK
506
is
complicated
by
substantial
hypertension
and
nephrotoxicity
.

To
clarify
the
mechanisms
of
FK
506

-induced

hypertension
,
we
studied
the
chronic
effects
of
FK
506
on
the
synthesis
of
endothelin-1
(
ET-1
)
,
the
expression
of
mRNA
of
ET-1
and
endothelin
-
converting
enzyme-1
(
ECE-1
)
,
the
endothelial
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
eNOS
)
activity
,
and
the
expression
of
mRNA
of
eNOS
and
C
-
type
natriuretic
peptide
(
CNP
)
in
rat
blood
vessels
.

In
addition
,
the
effect
of
the
specific
endothelin
type
A
receptor
antagonist
FR
139317
on
FK
506
-induced

in
rats
was
studied
.

FK
506
,
5
mg

kg-1
.

d-1
given
for
4
weeks
,
elevated
blood
pressure
from
102+/-13
to
152+/-15
mm
Hg
and
increased
the
synthesis
of
ET-1
and
the
levels
of
ET-1
mRNA
in
the
mesenteric
artery
(
240
%
and
230
%
,
respectively
)
.

Little
change
was
observed
in
the
expression
of
ECE-1
mRNA
and
CNP
mRNA
.

FK
506
decreased
eNOS
activity
and
the
levels
of
eNOS
mRNA
in
the
aorta
(
48
%
and
55
%
,
respectively
)
.

The
administration
of
FR
139317

(
10
mg
.

kg-1
.

d-1
)
prevented
FK
506

-induced

hypertension
in
rats
.

These
results
indicate
that
FK
506
may
increase
blood
pressure
not
only
by
increasing
ET-1
production
but
also
by
decreasing
NO
synthesis
in
the
vasculature
.

Suxamethonium

Here
,
we
present
a
similar
incident
in
a
severely
depressed
patient
who
received
electroconvulsive

)
.

Prolonged

OBJECTIVE
:

To
determine
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
adjunctive
bupropion

(
SR
)
on
male
sexual
dysfunction

(
SD

and
the
most
effective
treatments
have
yet
to
be
determined
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

The
randomized
sample
consisted
of
234
euthymic
men
who
were
receiving
some
type
of
SSRI
.

The
men
were
randomly
assigned
to
bupropion
SR

(
150
mg
twice
daily
,
117
)
or
placebo
(
twice
daily
,
117
)
for
12
weeks
.

Efficacy
was
evaluated
using
the
Clinical
Global
Impression
-
Sexual
Function
(
CGI
-
SF
;
the
primary
outcome
measure
)
,
the
International
Index
of
Erectile

(
IIEF
)
,
Arizona
Sexual

(
ASEX
)
,
and
Erectile

(
EDITS
)
(
secondary
outcome
measures
)
.

Participants
were
followed
biweekly
during
study
period
.

RESULTS
:

After
12
weeks
of
treatment
,
the
mean
(
sd
)
scores
for
CGI
-
SF
were
significantly
lower
,
i.e.
better
,
in
patients
on
bupropion
SR
,
at
2.4
(
1.2
)
,
than
in
the
placebo
group
,
at
3.9
(
1.1
)

(
P=
0.01
)
.

Men
who
received
bupropion
had
a
significant
increase
in
the
total
IIEF
score
(
54.4
%
vs
1.2
%
;
P=
0.003
)
,
and
in
the
five
different
domains
of
the
IIEF
.

Total
ASEX
scores
were
significantly
lower
,
i.e.
better
,
among
men
who
received
bupropion
than
placebo
,
at
15.5
(
4.3
)
vs
21.5
(
4.7
)

(
P=
0.002
)
.

The
EDITS
scores
were
67.4
(
10.2
)
for
the
bupropion
and
36.3
(
11.7
)
for
the
placebo
group
(
P=
0.001
)
.

The
ASEX
score
and
CGI
-
SF
score
were
correlated
(
P=
0.003
)
.

In
linear
regression
analyses
the
CGI
-
SF
score
was
not
affected
significantly
by
the
duration
of
SD
,
type
of
SSRI
used
and
age
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Bupropion
is
an
effective
treatment
for
male
SD
induced
by
SSRIs
.

These
results
provide
empirical
support
for
conducting
a
further
study
of
bupropion
.

Lamivudine
for

B
virus
reactivation
in
hepatitis
-
B
surface
antigen

(
HBSAG
)
seropositive

cancer
patients
undergoing
cytotoxic
chemotherapy
.

Hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
is
one
of
the
major
causes
of
chronic
liver
disease
worldwide
.

Cancer
patients
who
are
chronic
carriers
of
HBV
have
a
higher
hepatic
complication
rate
while
receiving
cytotoxic
chemotherapy
(
CT
)
and
this
has
mainly
been
attributed
to
HBV
reactivation
.

In
this
study
,
cancer
patients
who
have
solid
and
hematological
malignancies
with
chronic
HBV
infection
received
the
antiviral
agent
lamivudine
prior
and
during
CT
compared
with
historical
control
group
who
did
not
receive
lamivudine
.

The
objectives
were
to
assess
the
efficacy
of
lamivudine
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
HBV
reactivation
,
and
diminishing
morbidity
and
mortality
during
CT
.

Two
groups
were
compared
in
this
study
.

The
prophylactic
lamivudin
group
consisted
of
37
patients
who
received
prophylactic
lamivudine
treatment
.

The
historical
controls
consisted
of
50
consecutive
patients
who
underwent
CT
without
prophylactic
lamivudine
.

They
were
followed
up
during
and
for
8
weeks
after
CT
.

The
outcomes
were
compared
for
both
groups
.

Of
our
control
group
(
n=
50
)
,
21
patients
(
42
%
)
were
established

hepatitis
.

Twelve
(
24
%
)
of
them
were
evaluated
as
severe
hepatitis
.

In
the
prophylactic
lamivudine
group
severe
hepatitis
were
observed
only
in
1
patient
(
2.7
%
)
of
37
patients
(
p
0.006
)
.

Comparison
of
the
mean
ALT
values
revealed
significantly
higher
mean
alanine
aminotransferase
(
ALT
)
values
in
the
control
group
than
the
prophylactic
lamivudine
group
;
154:64
(
p
0.32
)
.

Our
study
suggests
that
prophylactic
lamivudine
significantly
decreases
the
incidence
of
HBV
reactivation
and
overall
morbidity
in
cancer
patients
during
and
after
immunosuppressive
therapy
.

Further
studies
are
needed
to
determine
the
most
appropriate
nucleoside
or
nucleotide
analogue
for
antiviral
prophylaxis
during
CT
and
the
optimal
duration
of
administration
after
completion
of
CT
.

Ginsenoside
Rg1
restores
the
impairment
of
learning
induced
by
chronic
morphine
administration
in
rats
.

Rg1
,
as
a
ginsenoside
extracted
from
Panax
ginseng
,
could
ameliorate
spatial
learning
impairment
.

Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
Rg1
might
be
a
useful
agent
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
the
adverse
effects
of
morphine
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
effect
of
Rg1
on
learning
impairment
by
chronic
morphine
administration
and
the
mechanism
responsible
for
this
effect
.

Male
rats
were
subcutaneously
injected
with
morphine

(
10
mg
/
kg
)
twice
a
day
at
12
hour
intervals
for
10
days
,
and
Rg1
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
was
intraperitoneally
injected
2
hours
after
the
second
injection
of
morphine
once
a
day
for
10
days
.

Spatial
learning
capacity
was
assessed
in
the
Morris
water
maze
.

The
results
showed
that
rats
treated
with
Morphine
/
Rg1
decreased
escape
latency
and
increased
the
time
spent
in
platform
quadrant
and
entering
frequency
.

By
implantation
of
electrodes
and
electrophysiological
recording
in
vivo
,
the
results
showed
that
Rg1
restored
the
long
-
term
potentiation
(
LTP
)
impaired
by
morphine
in
both
freely
moving
and
anaesthetised
rats
.

The
electrophysiological
recording
in
vitro
showed
that
Rg1
restored
the
LTP
in
slices
from
the
rats
treated
with
morphine
,
but
not
changed
LTP
in
the
slices
from
normal
saline-
or
morphine
/
Rg1

-treated
rats
;
this
restoration
could
be
inhibited
by
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptor
antagonist
MK801
.

We
conclude
that
Rg1
may
significantly
improve
the
spatial
learning
capacity
impaired
by
chonic
morphine
administration
and
restore
the
morphine
-inhibited
LTP
.

This
effect
is
NMDA

A
study
on
the
effect
of
the
duration
of
subcutaneous
heparin
injection
on
bruising
and
pain
.

AIM
:
This
study
was
carried
out
to
determine
the
effect
of
injection
duration
on
bruising
and
pain
following
the
administration
of
the
subcutaneous
injection
of
heparin
.

BACKGROUND
:

Although
different
methods
to
prevent
bruising
and
pain
following
the
subcutaneous
injection
of
heparin
have
been
widely
studied
and
described
,
the
effect
of
injection
duration
on
the
occurrence
of
bruising
and
pain
is
little
documented
.

DESIGN
:

This
study
was
designed
as
within
-
subject
,
quasi
-
experimental
research
.

METHOD
:

The
sample
for
the
study
consisted
of
50
patients
to
whom
subcutaneous
heparin
was
administered
.

Heparin
was
injected
over
10
seconds
on
the
right
abdominal
site
and
30
seconds
on
the
left
abdominal
site
.

Injections
areas
were
assessed
for
the
presence
of
bruising
at
48
and
72
hours
after
each
injection
.

Dimensions
of
the
bruising
on
the
heparin
applied
areas
were
measured
using
transparent
millimetric
measuring
paper
.

The
visual
analog
scale
(
VAS
)
was
used
to
measure
pain
intensity
and
a
stop
-
watch
was
used
to
time
the
pain
period
.

Data
were
analysed
using
chi
-
square
test
,
Mann
-
Whitney
U
,
Wilcoxon
signed
ranks
tests
and
correlation
.

RESULTS
:

The
percentage
of
bruising
occurrence
was
64
%
with
the
injection
of
10
seconds
duration
and
42
%
in
the
30-second
injection
.

It
was
determined
that
the
size
of
the
bruising
was
smaller
in
the
30-second
injection
.

Pain
intensity
and
pain
period
were
statistically
significantly
lower
for
the
30-second
injection
than
for
the
10-second
injection
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

It
was
determined
that
injection
duration
had
an
effect
on
bruising
and
pain
following
the
subcutaneous
administration
of
heparin
.

This
study
should
be
repeated
on
a
larger
sample
.

RELEVANCE
TO
CLINICAL
PRACTICE
:

When
administering
subcutaneous
heparin
injections
,
it
is
important
to
extend
the
duration
of
the
injection
.

Acute
reserpine
and
subchronic
haloperidol
treatments
change
synaptosomal
brain
glutamate
uptake
and
elicit
orofacial
dyskinesia
in
rats
.

Reserpine
-
and
haloperidol
-induced
orofacial
dyskinesia
are
putative
animal
models
of
tardive
dyskinesia

(
TD
)
whose
pathophysiology
has
been
related
to
free
radical
generation
and
oxidative
stress
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
authors
induced
orofacial
dyskinesia
by
acute
reserpine
and
subchronic
haloperidol
administration
to
rats
.

Reserpine
injection
(
one
dose
of
1
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)

every
other
day
for
3
days
caused
a
significant
increase
in
vacuous
chewing
,
tongue
protrusion
and
duration
of
facial
twitching
,
compared
to
the
control
.

Haloperidol
administration
(
one
dose
of
12
mg
/
kg
once
a
week
s.c
.
)

for
4
weeks
caused
an
increase
in
vacuous
chewing
,
tongue
protrusion
and
duration
of
facial
twitching
observed
in
four
weekly
evaluations
.

After
the
treatments
and
behavioral
observation
,
glutamate
uptake
by
segments
of
the
brain
was
analyzed
.

A
decreased
glutamate
uptake
was
observed
in
the
subcortical
parts
of
animals
treated
with
reserpine
and
haloperidol
,
compared
to
the
control
.

Importantly
,
a
decrease
in
glutamate
uptake
correlates
negatively
with
an
increase
in
the
incidence
of
orofacial
diskinesia
.

These
results
indicate
that
early
changes
in
glutamate
transport
may
be
related
to
the
development
of
vacuous
chewing
movements
in
rats
.

Acute
psychosis
due
to
treatment
with
phenytoin
in
a
nonepileptic
patient
.

The
development
of
psychosis
related
to
antiepileptic
drug
treatment
is
usually
attributed
to
the
interaction
between
the
epileptic
brain
substratum
and
the
antiepileptic
drugs
.

The
case
of
a
nonepileptic
patient
who
developed
psychosis
following
phenytoin
treatment
for
trigeminal
neuralgia
is
described
.

This
case
suggests
that
the
psychotic
symptoms
that
occur
following
phenytoin
treatment
in
some
epileptic
patients
may
be
the
direct
result
of
medication
,
unrelated
to
seizures
.

The
effect
of
treatment
with
gum
Arabic
on
gentamicin
nephrotoxicity
in
rats
:
a
preliminary
study
.

In
the
present
work
we
assessed
the
effect
of
treatment
of
rats
with
gum
Arabic
on
acute
renal
failure
induced
by
gentamicin

(
GM
)
nephrotoxicity
.

Rats
were
treated
with
the
vehicle
(
2
mL
/
kg
of
distilled
water
and
5
%
w
/
v
cellulose
,
10
days
)
,
gum
Arabic
(
2
mL
/
kg
of
a
10
%
w
/
v
aqueous
suspension
of
gum
Arabic
powder
,
orally
for
10
days
)
,
or
gum
Arabic
concomitantly
with
GM

(
80mg
/
kg
/
day
intramuscularly
,
during
the
last
six
days
of
the
treatment
period
)
.

Nephrotoxicity
was
assessed
by
measuring
the
concentrations
of
creatinine
and
urea
in
the
plasma
and
reduced
glutathione

(
GSH
)
in
the
kidney
cortex
,
and
by
light
microscopic
examination
of
kidney
sections
.

The
results
indicated
that
concomitant
treatment
with
gum
Arabic
and
GM
significantly
increased
creatinine
and
urea
by
about
183
and
239
%
,
respectively
(
compared
to
432
and
346
%
,
respectively
,
in
rats
treated
with
cellulose
and
GM
)
,
and
decreased
that
of
cortical
GSH
by
21
%
(
compared
to
27
%
in
the
cellulose
plus
GM
group
)

The
GM
-induced
proximal
tubular
necrosis
appeared
to
be
slightly
less
severe
in
rats
given
GM
together
with

gum
Arabic
than
in
those
given
GM
and
cellulose
.

It
could
be
inferred
that
gum
Arabic
treatment
has
induced
a
modest
amelioration
of
some
of
the
histological
and
biochemical
indices
of
GM

nephrotoxicity
.

Further
work
is
warranted
on
the
effect
of
the
treatments
on
renal
functional
aspects
in
models
of
chronic
renal
failure
,
and
on
the
mechanism(s
)
involved
.

Visual
hallucinations
associated
with
zonisamide
.

Zonisamide
is
a
broad
-
spectrum
antiepileptic
drug
used
to
treat
various
types
of
seizures
.

Although
visual
hallucinations
have
not
been
reported
as
an
adverse
effect
of
this
agent
,
we
describe
three
patients
who
experienced
complex
visual
hallucinations
and
altered
mental
status
after
zonisamide
treatment
was
begun
or
its
dosage
increased
.

All
three
had
been
diagnosed
earlier
with
epilepsy
,
and
their
electroencephalogram
(
EEG
)
findings
were
abnormal
.

During
monitoring
,
visual
hallucinations
did
not
correlate
with
EEG
readings
,
nor
did
video
recording
capture
any
of
the
described
events
.

None
of
the
patients
had
experienced
visual
hallucinations
before
this
event
.

The
only
recent
change
in
their
treatment
was
the
introduction
or
increased
dosage
of
zonisamide
.

With
either
discontinuation
or
decreased
dosage
of
the
drug
the
symptoms
disappeared
and
did
not
recur
.

Further
observations
and
reports
will
help
clarify
this
adverse
effect
.

Until
then
,
clinicians
need
to
be
aware
of
this
possible
complication
associated
with
zonisamide
.

GLEPP1
receptor
tyrosine
phosphatase
(
Ptpro
)
in
rat
PAN
nephrosis
.

A
marker
of
acute
podocyte
injury
.

Glomerular
epithelial
protein
1
(
GLEPP1
)
is
a
podocyte
receptor
membrane
protein

tyrosine
phosphatase
located
on
the
apical
cell
membrane
of
visceral
glomerular
epithelial
cell
and
foot
processes
.

This
receptor
plays
a
role
in
regulating
the
structure
and
function
of
podocyte
foot
process
.

To
better
understand
the
utility
of
GLEPP1
as
a
marker
of
glomerular
injury
,
the
amount
and
distribution
of
GLEPP1
protein
and
mRNA
were
examined
by
immunohistochemistry
,
Western
blot
and
RNase
protection
assay
in
a
model
of
podocyte
injury
in
the
rat
.

Puromycin
aminonucleoside

nephrosis
was
induced
by
single
intraperitoneal
injection
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
,
20
mg/100
g
BW
)
.

Tissues
were
analyzed
at
0
,
5
,
7
,
11
,
21
,
45
,
80
and
126
days
after
PAN
injection
so
as
to
include
both
the
acute
phase
of
proteinuria
associated
with
foot
process
effacement
(
days
5
-
11
)
and
the
chronic
phase
of
proteinuria
associated
with
glomerulosclerosis

(
days
45
-
126
)
.

At
day
5
,
GLEPP1
protein
and
mRNA
were
reduced
from
the
normal
range
(
265.2
+
/-

79.6
x
10(6
)
moles
/
glomerulus
and
100
%
)
to
15
%
of
normal
(
41.8
+
/-

4.8
x
10(6
)
moles
/
glomerulus
,
p
0.005
)
.

This
occurred
in
association
with
an
increase
in
urinary
protein
content
from
1.8
+
/-
1
to
99.0
+
/-

61
mg
/
day
(
p
0.001
)
.

In
contrast
,
podocalyxin
did
not
change
significantly
at
this
time
.

By
day
11
,
GLEPP1
protein
and
mRNA
had
begun
to
return
towards
baseline
.

By
day
45
-
126
,
at
a
time
when
glomerular
scarring
was
present
,
GLEPP1
was
absent
from
glomerulosclerotic
areas
although
the
total
glomerular
content
of
GLEPP1
was
not
different
from
normal
.

We
conclude
that
GLEPP1
expression
,
unlike
podocalyxin
,
reflects
podocyte
injury
induced
by
PAN
.

GLEPP1
expression
may
be
a
useful
marker
of
podocyte
injury
.

Ticlopidine
-induced
aplastic
anemia
:
report
of
three
Chinese
patients
and
review
of
the
literature
.

In
this
study
,
three
Chinese
patients
with
ticlopidine
-induced

aplastic
anemia
were
reported
and
another
13
patients
in
the
English
literature
were
reviewed
.

We
attempted
to
find
underlying
similarities
,
evaluate
the
risk
factors
,
and
identify
appropriate
treatment
for
this
complication
.

All
but
one
of
the
patients
were
over
60
years
old
,
and
the
6
who
died
were
all
older
than
65
.

Therefore
,
old
age
may
be
a
risk
factor
for
developing
this
complication
.

Agranulocytosis
occurred
3
-
20
weeks
after
initiation
of
ticlopidine
,
so
frequent
examination
of
white
cell
count
during
treatment
is
recommended
.

There
seemed
to
be
no
direct
correlation
between
the
dose
or
duration
used
and
the
severity
of
bone
marrow
suppression
.

Treatment
for
ticlopidine

-induced

aplastic
anemia
with
colony
-
stimulating
factors
seemed
to
have
little
effect
.

The
fact
that
5
of
the
6
patients
who
received
concurrent
calcium
channel
blockers
died
,
should
alert
clinicians
to
be
more
cautious
when
using
these
two
drugs
simultaneously
.

Facilitation
of
memory
retrieval
by
pre
-
test
morphine
and
its
state
dependency
in
the
step
-
through
type
passive
avoidance
learning
test
in
mice
.

Amnesia
produced
by
scopolamine
and
cycloheximide
were
reversed
by
morphine
given
30
min
before
the
test
trial
(
pre
-
test
)
,
and
pre
-
test
morphine
also
facilitated
the
memory
retrieval
in
the
animals
administered
naloxone
during
the
training
trial
.

Similarly
,
pre
-
test
scopolamine
partially
reversed
the
scopolamine
-induced
amnesia
,
but
not
significantly
;
and
pre
-
test
cycloheximide
failed
to
reverse
the
cycloheximide
-induced
amnesia
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
facilitation
of
memory
retrieval
by
pre
-
test
morphine
might
be
the
direct
action
of
morphine
rather
than
a
state
dependent
effect
.

Test
conditions
influence
the
response
to
a
drug
challenge
in
rodents
.

These
studies
were
conducted
to
examine
the
differential
response
to
a
drug
challenge
under
varied
experimental
test
conditions
routinely
employed
to
study
drug
-
induced
behavioral
and
neurophysiological
responses
in
rodents
.

Apomorphine
,
a
nonselective
dopamine
agonist
,
was
selected
due
to
its
biphasic
behavioral
effects
,
its
ability
to
induce
hypothermia
,
and
to
produce
distinct
changes
to
dopamine
turnover
in
the
rodent
brain
.

From
such
experiments
there
is
evidence
that
characterization
and
detection
of
apomorphine
-induced
activity
in
rodents
critically
depends
upon
the
test
conditions
employed
.

In
rats
,
detection
of
apomorphine
-induced

hyperactivity
was
facilitated
by
a
period
of
acclimatization
to
the
test
conditions
.

Moreover
,
test
conditions
can
impact
upon
other
physiological
responses
to
apomorphine
such
as
drug
-
induced
hypothermia
.

In
mice
,
apomorphine
produced
qualitatively
different
responses
under
novel
conditions
when
compared
to
those
behaviors
elicited
in
the
home
test
cage
.

Drug
-
induced
gross
activity
counts
were
increased
in
the
novel
exploratory
box
only
,
while
measures
of
stereotypic
behavior
were
similar
in
both
.

By
contrast
,
apomorphine
-induced
locomotion
was
more
prominent
in
the
novel
exploratory
box
.

Dopamine
turnover
ratios
(
DOPAC
:
DA
and
HVA
:
DA
)
were
found
to
be
lower
in
those
animals
exposed
to
the
exploratory
box
when
compared
to
their
home
cage
counterparts
.

However
,
apomorphine
-induced
reductions
in
striatal
dopamine
turnover
were
detected
in
both
novel
and
home
cage
environments
.

The
implications
of
these
findings
are
discussed
with
particular
emphasis
upon
conducting
psychopharmacological
challenge
tests
in
rodents
.

Tricuspid
valve
regurgitation
and
lithium
carbonate

toxicity
in
a
newborn
infant
.

A
newborn
with
massive
tricuspid
regurgitation
,
atrial
flutter
,
congestive
heart
failure
,
and
a
high
serum
lithium
level
is
described
.

This
is
the
first
patient
to
initially
manifest
tricuspid
regurgitation
and
atrial
flutter
,
and
the
11th
described
patient
with
cardiac
disease
among
infants
exposed
to
lithium
compounds
in
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy
.

Sixty
-
three
percent
of
these
infants
had
tricuspid
valve
involvement
.

Lithium
carbonate
may
be
a
factor
in
the
increasing
incidence
of
congenital
heart
disease
when
taken
during
early
pregnancy
.

It
also
causes
neurologic
depression
,
cyanosis
,
and
cardiac
arrhythmia
when
consumed
prior
to
delivery
.

Phenobarbital
-induced
dyskinesia
in
a
neurologically
-
impaired
child
.

A
2-year
-
old
child
with
known
neurologic
impairment
developed
a
dyskinesia
soon
after
starting
phenobarbital
therapy
for
seizures
.

Known
causes
of
movement
disorders
were
eliminated
after
evaluation
.

On
repeat
challenge
with
phenobarbital
,
the
dyskinesia
recurred
.

Phenobarbital
should
be
added
to
the
list
of
anticonvulsant
drugs
that
can
cause
movement
disorders
.

Acute
changes
of
blood
ammonia
may
predict
short
-
term
adverse
effects
of
valproic
acid
.

Valproic
acid

(
VPA
)
was
given
to
24
epileptic
patients
who
were
already
being
treated
with
other
antiepileptic
drugs
.

A
standardized
loading
dose
of

VPA
was
administered
,
and
venous
blood
was
sampled
at
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
and
4
hours
.

Ammonia

(
NH3
)
was
higher
in
patients
who
,
during
continuous
therapy
,
complained
of
drowsiness

(
7
patients
)
than
in
those
who
were
symptom
-
free
(
17
patients
)
,
although
VPA
plasma
levels
were
similar
in
both
groups
.

By
measuring
VPA
-induced
changes
of
blood
NH3
content
,
it
may
be
possible
to
identify
patients
at
higher
risk
of
obtundation
when
VPA
is
given
chronically
.

Effects
of
calcitonin
on
rat
extrapyramidal
motor
system
:
behavioral
and
biochemical
data
.

The
effects
of
i.v.c
.
injection
of
human
and
salmon
calcitonin
on
biochemical
and
behavioral
parameters
related
to
the
extrapyramidal
motor
system
,
were
investigated
in
male
rats
.

Calcitonin
injection
resulted
in
a
potentiation
of
haloperidol

-induced

catalepsy
and
a
partial
prevention
of
apomorphine
-induced
hyperactivity
.

Moreover
calcitonin
induced
a
significant
decrease
in
nigral
GAD
activity
but
no
change
in
striatal
DA
and
DOPAC
concentration
or
GAD
activity
.

The
results
are
discussed
in
view
of
a
primary
action
of
calcitonin
on
the
striatonigral
GABAergic
pathway
mediating
the
DA
-related
behavioral
messages
of
striatal
origin
.

Development
of
isoproterenol

-induced

cardiac
hypertrophy
.

The
development
of
cardiac
hypertrophy
was
studied
in
adult
female
Wistar
rats
following
daily
subcutaneous
injections
of
isoproterenol

(
ISO
)
(
0.3
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
.

A
time
course
was
established
for
the
change
in
tissue
mass
,
RNA
and
DNA
content
,
as
well
as
hydroxyproline
content
.

Heart
weight
increased
44
%
after
8
days
of
treatment
with
a
half
time
of
3.4
days
.

Ventricular
RNA
content
was
elevated
26
%
after
24
h
of
a
single
injection
and
reached
a
maximal
level
following
8
days
of
therapy
.

The
half
time
for
RNA
accumulation
was
2.0
days
.

The
total
content
of
hydroxyproline
remained
stable
during
the
first
2
days
of
treatment
but
increased
46
%
after
4
days
of
therapy
.

Ventricular
DNA
content
was
unchanged
during
the
early
stage
(
1
-
4
days
)
of
hypertrophic
growth
but
increased
to
a
new
steady
-
state
level
19
%
above
the
controls
after
8
days
of
treatment
.

Intraventricular
pressures
and
coronary
flow
measures
were
similar
for
control
and
experimental
animals
following
4
days
of
developed
hypertrophy
.

However
,
dP
/
dt
in
the
ISO

-treated

hearts
was
slightly
but
significantly
(
P
less
than
0.05
)
elevated
.

These
data
indicate
that
the
adaptive
response
to
ISO
shows
an
early
hypertrophic
phase
(
1
-
4
days
)
characterized
by
a
substantial
increase
in
RNA
content
and
cardiac
mass
in
the
absence
of
changes
in
DNA
.

However
,
prolonged
stimulation
(
8
-
12
days
)
appears
to
represent
a
complex
integration
of
both
cellular
hypertrophy
and
hyperplasia
within
the
heart
.

Co-
carcinogenic
effect
of
retinyl

carcinogenesis
of
male
F344
rats
induced
with
butylated

.

The
potential
modifying
effect
of
retinyl
acetate

(
RA
)
on
butylated
hydroxyanisole

(
BHA
)
-induced

rat
forestomach
tumorigenesis
was
examined
.

Male
F344
rats
,
5
weeks
of
age
,
were
maintained
on
diet
containing
1
%
or
2
%
BHA
by
weight
and
simultaneously
on
drinking
water
supplemented
with
RA
at
various
concentrations
(
w
/
v
)
for
52
weeks
.

In
groups
given
2
%
BHA
,
although
marked
hyperplastic
changes
of
the
forestomach
epithelium
were
observed
in
all
animals
,
co
-
administration
of
0.25
%

RA
significantly
(
P
less
than
0.05
)
increased
the
incidence
of
forestomach
tumors

(
squamous
cell
papilloma
and
carcinoma
)
to
60
%
(
9/15
,
2
rats
with
carcinoma
)
from
15
%
(
3/20
,
one
rat
with
carcinoma
)
in
the
group
given
RA
-free
water
.

In
rats
given
1
%
BHA
,

RA
co
-
administered
at
a
dose
of
0.05
,
0.1
,
0.2
or
0.25
%
showed
a
dose
-
dependent
enhancing
effect
on
the
development
of
the
BHA
-induced
epithelial
hyperplasia
.

Tumors
,
all
papillomas
,
were
induced
in
3
rats
(
17
%
)
with
0.25
%
RA
and
in
one
rat
(
10
%
)
with
0.05
%
RA
co
-
administration
.

RA
alone
did
not
induce
hyperplastic
changes
in
the
forestomach
.

These
findings
indicate
that
RA
acted
as
a
co
-
carcinogen
in
the
BHA
forestomach
carcinogenesis
of
the
rat
.

Ketanserin
pretreatment
reverses
alfentanil

-induced

muscle
rigidity
.

Systemic
pretreatment
with
ketanserin
,
a
relatively
specific
type-2
serotonin
receptor
antagonist
,
significantly
attenuated
the
muscle
rigidity
produced
in
rats
by
the
potent
short
-
acting
opiate
agonist
alfentanil
.

Following
placement
of
subcutaneous
electrodes
in
each
animal
's
left
gastrocnemius
muscle
,
rigidity
was
assessed
by
analyzing
root
-
mean
-
square
electromyographic
activity
.

Intraperitoneal
ketanserin
administration
at
doses
of
0.63
and
2.5

mg
/
kg
prevented

the
alfentanil
-induced
increase
in
electromyographic
activity
compared
with
animals
pretreated
with
saline
.

Chlordiazepoxide
at
doses
up
to
10
mg
/
kg
failed
to
significantly
influence
the
rigidity
produced
by
alfentanil
.

Despite
the
absence
of
rigidity
,
animals
that
received
ketanserin

(
greater
than
0.31
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

followed
by

alfentanil
were
motionless
,
flaccid
,
and
less
responsive
to
external
stimuli
than
were
animals
receiving
alfentanil
alone
.

Rats
that
received
ketanserin
and
alfentanil
exhibited
less
rearing
and
exploratory
behavior
at
the
end
of
the
60-min
recording
period
than
did
animals
that
received
ketanserin
alone
.

These
results
,
in
combination
with
previous
work
,
suggest
that
muscle
rigidity
,
a
clinically
relevant
side
-
effect
of
parenteral
narcotic
administration
,
may
be
partly
mediated
via
serotonergic
pathways
.

Pretreatment
with
type-2
serotonin
antagonists
may
be
clinically
useful
in
attenuating
opiate
-
induced
rigidity
,
although
further
studies
will
be
necessary
to
assess
the
interaction
of
possibly
enhanced
CNS
,
cardiovascular
,
and
respiratory
depression
.

Glycopyrronium
requirements
for
antagonism
of
the
muscarinic
side
effects
of
edrophonium
.

We
have
compared
,
in
60
adult
patients
,
the
cardiovascular
effects
of
glycopyrronium
5
micrograms
kg-1
and
10
micrograms
kg-1
given
either
simultaneously
or
1
min
before
edrophonium

1
mg
kg-1
.

Significant
differences
between
the
four
groups
were
detected
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
.

Both
groups
receiving
10
micrograms
kg-1
showed
increases
in
heart
rate
of
up
to
30
beat
min-1

(
95
%
confidence
limits
28
-
32
beat
min-1
)
.

Use
of
glycopyrronium
5
micrograms
kg-1
provided
greater
cardiovascular
stability
and
,
given
1
min
before
the
edrophonium
,
was
sufficient
to
minimize
early
,
edrophonium

-induced
bradycardias
.

This
low
dose
of
glycopyrronium
provided
good
control
of
oropharyngeal
secretions
.

Involvement
of
locus
coeruleus
and
noradrenergic
neurotransmission
in
fentanyl

-induced

muscular
rigidity
in
the
rat
.

Whereas
muscular
rigidity
is
a
well
-
known
side
effect
that
is
associated
with
high
-
dose
fentanyl
anesthesia
,
a
paucity
of
information
exists
with
regard
to
its
underlying
mechanism(s
)
.

We
investigated
in
this
study
the
possible
engagement
of
locus
coeruleus
of
the
pons
in
this
phenomenon
,
using
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
anesthetized
with
ketamine
.

Under
proper
control
of
respiration
,
body
temperature
and
end
-
tidal
CO2
,
intravenous
administration
of
fentanyl

(
50
or
100
micrograms
/
kg
)
consistently
promoted
an
increase
in
electromyographic
activity
recorded
from
the
gastrocnemius
and
abdominal
rectus
muscles
.

Such
an
induced
muscular
rigidity
by
the
narcotic
agent
was
significantly
antagonized
or
even
reduced
by
prior
electrolytic
lesions
of
the
locus
coeruleus
or
pretreatment
with
the
alpha
-
adrenoceptor
blocker
,
prazosin
.

Microinjection
of
fentanyl
(
2.5
micrograms/50
nl
)
directly
into
this
pontine
nucleus
,
on
the
other
hand
,
elicited
discernible
electromyographic
excitation
.

It
is
speculated
that
the
induction
of
muscular
rigidity
by
fentanyl
may
involve
the
coerulospinal
noradrenergic
fibers
to
the
spinal
motoneurons
.

Cerebral
sinus
thrombosis
as
a
potential
hazard
of
antifibrinolytic
treatment
in
menorrhagia
.

We
describe
a
42-year
-
old
woman
who
developed
superior
sagittal
and
left
transverse
sinus
thrombosis
associated
with
prolonged
epsilon
-
aminocaproic
acid
therapy
for
menorrhagia
.

This
antifibrinolytic
agent
has
been
used
in
women
with
menorrhagia
to
promote
clotting
and
reduce
blood
loss
.

Although
increased
risk
of
thromboembolic
disease
has
been
reported
during
treatment
with
epsilon
-
aminocaproic
acid
,

cerebral
sinus
thrombosis
has
not
been
previously
described
.

Careful
use
of
epsilon
-
aminocaproic
acid

therapy
is
recommended
.

Hemorrhagic
cystitis
complicating
bone
marrow
transplantation
.

Hemorrhagic
cystitis
is
a
potentially
serious
complication
of
high
-
dose
cyclophosphamide
therapy
administered
before
bone
marrow
transplantation
.

As
standard
practice
at
our
institution
,
patients
who
are
scheduled
to
receive
a
bone
marrow
transplant
are
treated
prophylactically
with
forced
hydration
and
bladder
irrigation
.

In
an
attempt
to
obviate
the
inconvenience
of
bladder
irrigation
,
we
conducted
a
feasibility
trial
of
uroprophylaxis
with
mesna
,
which
neutralizes
the
hepatic
metabolite
of
cyclophosphamide
that
causes
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

Of
97
patients
who
received
standard
prophylaxis
,
4
had
symptomatic
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

In
contrast
,
two
of
four
consecutive
patients
who
received
mesna
uroprophylaxis
before
allogeneic
bone
marrow
transplantation
had
severe
hemorrhagic
cystitis
for
at
least
2
weeks
.

Because
of
this
suboptimal
result
,
we
resumed
the
use
of
bladder
irrigation
and
forced
hydration
to
minimize
the
risk
of
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

Reversal

by
flumazenil
after
intravenous
conscious

with
diazepam
and
opioids
:
report
of

blind
multicenter
study
.

The
Flumazenil
in
Intravenous
Conscious
Sedation
with
Diazepam

Multicenter
Study
Group
II
.

The
efficacy
and
safety
of
a
new
benzodiazepine
antagonist
,
flumazenil
,
were
assessed
in
a
double
-
blind
multicenter
study
.

Flumazenil

(
mean
dose
,
0.76
mg
)
or
placebo
(
mean
dose
,
8.9
ml
)
was
administered
intravenously
to
130
and
67
patients
,
respectively
,
who
had
been
given
diazepam
in
conjunction
with
an
opioid
(
fentanyl
,
meperidine
,
or
morphine
)
for
the
induction
and
maintenance
of
intravenous
conscious
sedation
for
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
surgical
procedures
.

The
group
assessable
for
efficacy
comprised
122
patients
treated
with
flumazenil
and
64
patients
given
placebo
.

After
5
minutes
,
80/115
(
70
%
)

flumazenil

-treated
patients
,
compared
with
21/63
(
33
%
)
placebo
-
treated
patients
,
were
completely
awake
and
alert
,
as
indicated
by
a
score
of
5
on
the
Observer
's
Assessment
of
Alertness
/
Sedation
Scale
.

Ninety
-
five
percent
of
patients
in
each
group
who
attained
a
score
of
5
at
the
5-minute
assessment
showed
no
loss
of
alertness
throughout
the
180-minute
assessment
period
.

Flumazenil

-treated
patients
also
performed
significantly
better
on
the
Finger
-
to
-
Nose
Test
and
the
recall
of
pictures
shown
at
the
5-minute
assessment
.

Flumazenil
was
well
tolerated
,
with
no
serious
adverse
effects
reported
.

Thirty
-
nine
(
30
%
)
of

flumazenil

-treated
patients
,
compared
with
17
(
25
%
)
of
placebo
-
treated
patients
had
one
or
more
drug
-
related
adverse
experiences
.

The
most
common
adverse
effects
were
nausea
and
vomiting
in
the
flumazenil
group
and
nausea
and
injection
-
site
pain
in
the
placebo
group
.

Flumazenil
was
found
to
promptly
reverse
sedation
induced
by
diazepam
in
the
presence
of
opioids
.

Hepatic

Two
cases
of
hepatic
adenoma
and
one
of
focal
nodular
hyperplasia
presumably
associated
with
the
use
of
oral
contraceptives
,
are
reported
.

Special
reference
is
made
to
their
clinical
presentation
,
which
may
be
totally
asymptomatic
.

Liver

tests
are
of
little
diagnostic
value
,
but
valuable
information
may
be
obtained
from
both

Arterial
thromboembolism
in
patients
receiving
systemic
heparin
therapy
:
a
complication
associated
with

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
.

Arterial

thromboembolism
is
a
recognized
complication
of
systemic
heparin
therapy
.

Characteristic
of
the
entity
is
arterial
occlusion
by
platelet
-
fibrin
thrombi
with
distal
ischemia
occurring
four
to
twenty
days
after
the
initiation
of
heparin
therapy
,
preceded
by
profound
thrombocytopenia
with
platelet
counts
in
the
range
of
30,000
to
40,000
per
cubic
millimeter
.

The
clinically
apparent
occlusion
may
be
preceded
by
gastrointestinal
and
musculoskeletal
symptoms
that
appear
to
be
ischemic
in
origin
,
and
might
serve
to
warn
the
clinician
of
these
complications
.

Previous
reports
of
these
phenomena
as
well
as
recent
studies
of
the
effect
of
heparin
are
reviewed
.

The
common
factor
relating
thromboembolism
and
thrombocytopenia
is
heparin

-induced

platelet
aggregation
.

Appropriate
treatment
consists
of
discontinuation
of
heparin
,
and
anticoagulation
with
sodium
warfarin
if
necessary
.

Vascular
procedures
are
performed
as
indicated
.

Long
-
term
prognosis
for
transplant
-
free
survivors
of
paracetamol

-induced

acute
liver
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
prognosis
for
transplant
-
free
survivors
of
paracetamol

-induced

acute
liver
failure
remains
unknown
.

AIM
:
To
examine
whether
paracetamol
-induced
acute
liver
failure
increases
long
-
term
mortality
.

METHODS
:
We
followed
up
all
transplant
-
free
survivors
of
paracetamol

-induced

acute
liver
injury
,
hospitalized
in
a
Danish
national
referral
centre
during
1984
-
2004
.

We
compared
age
-
specific
mortality
rates
from
1
year
post
-
discharge
through
2008
between
those
in
whom
the
liver
injury
led
to
an
acute
liver
failure
and
those
in
whom
it
did
not
.

RESULTS
:

We
included
641
patients
.

On
average
,
age
-
specific
mortality
rates
were
slightly
higher
for
the
101
patients
whose
paracetamol
-induced
liver
injury
had
caused
an
acute
liver
failure
(
adjusted
mortality
rate
ratio
=
1.70
,
95
%
CI
1.02
-
2.85
)
,
but
the
association
was
age
-
dependent
,
and
no
survivors
of
acute
liver
failure
died
of
liver
disease
,
whereas
suicides
were
frequent
in
both
groups
.

These
observations
speak
against
long
-
term
effects
of
acute
liver
failure
.

More
likely
,
the
elevated
mortality
rate
ratio
resulted
from
incomplete
adjustment
for
the
greater
prevalence
of
substance
abuse
among
survivors
of
acute
liver
failure
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Paracetamol
-induced

acute
liver
failure
did
not
affect
long
-
term
mortality
.

Clinical
follow
-
up
may
be
justified
by
the
cause
of
the
liver
failure
,
but
not
by
the
liver
failure
itself
.

Serotonin
6
receptor
gene
is
associated
with
methamphetamine
-induced
psychosis
in
a
Japanese
population
.

BACKGROUND
:

Altered
serotonergic
neural
transmission
is
hypothesized
to
be
a
susceptibility
factor
for
psychotic
disorders
such
as
schizophrenia
.

The
serotonin
6
(
5-HT
6
)
receptor
is
therapeutically
targeted
by
several
second
generation
antipsychotics
,
such
as
clozapine
and
olanzapine
,
and
d
-
amphetamine
-induced

hyperactivity
in
rats
is
corrected
with
the
use
of
a
selective
5-HT
6
receptor
antagonist
.

In
addition
,
the
disrupted
prepulse
inhibition
induced
by
d
-
amphetamine
or
phencyclidine
was
restored
by
5-HT
6
receptor
antagonist
in
an
animal
study
using
rats
.

These
animal
models
were
considered
to
reflect
the
positive
symptoms
of
schizophrenia
,
and
the
above
evidence
suggests
that
altered
5-HT
6
receptors
are
involved
in
the
pathophysiology
of
psychotic
disorders
.

The
symptoms
of
methamphetamine

(
METH
)
-induced

psychosis
are
similar
to
those
of
paranoid
type
schizophrenia
.

Therefore
,
we
conducted
an
analysis
of
the
association
of
the
5-HT
6
gene
(
HTR6
)
with

METH
-induced

psychosis
.

METHOD
:

Using
five
tagging
SNPs
(
rs6693503
,
rs1805054
,
rs4912138
,
rs3790757
and
rs9659997
)
,
we
conducted
a
genetic
association
analysis
of
case
-
control
samples
(
197
METH
-induced
psychosis
patients
and
337
controls
)
in
the
Japanese
population
.

The
age
and
sex
of
the
control
subjects
did
not
differ
from
those
of
the
methamphetamine
dependence
patients
.

RESULTS
:

rs6693503
was
associated
with

METH
-induced

psychosis
patients
in
the
allele
/
genotype
-
wise
analysis
.

Moreover
,
this
association
remained
significant
after
Bonferroni
correction
.

In
the
haplotype
-
wise
analysis
,
we
detected
an
association
between
two
markers
(
rs6693503
and
rs1805054
)
and
three
markers
(

Effect
of
increasing
intraperitoneal
infusion
rates
on
bupropion
hydrochloride
-induced

seizures
in
mice
.

BACKGROUND
:

It
is
not
known
if
there
is
a
relationship
between
input
rate
and
incidence
of
bupropion

-induced

seizures
.

This
is
important
,
since
different
controlled
release
formulations
of
bupropion
release
the
active
drug
at
different
rates
.

METHODS
:
We
investigated
the
effect
of
varying
the
intraperitoneal
infusion
rates
of
bupropion
HCl
120
mg
/
kg
,
a
known
convulsive
dose
50
(
CD50
)
,
on
the
incidence
and
severity
of
bupropion
-induced
convulsions
in
the
Swiss
albino
mice
.

A
total
of
69
mice
,
approximately
7
weeks
of
age
,
and
weighing
21.0
to
29.1
g
were
randomly
assigned
to
bupropion
HCl
120
mg
/
kg
treatment
by
intraperitoneal
(
IP
)
administration
in
7
groups
(
9
to
10
animals
per
group
)
.

Bupropion
HCl
was
infused
through
a
surgically
implanted
IP
dosing
catheter
with
infusions
in
each
group
of
0
min
,
15
min
,
30
min
,
60
min
,
90
min
,
120
min
,
and
240
min
.

The
number
,
time
of
onset
,
duration
and
the
intensity
of
the
convulsions
or
absence
of
convulsions
were
recorded
.

RESULTS
:

The
results
showed
that
IP
administration
of
bupropion
HCl
120
mg
/
kg
by
bolus
injection
induced
convulsions
in
6
out
of
10
mice
(
60
%
of
convulsing
mice
)
in
group
1
.

Logistic
regression
analysis
revealed
that
infusion
time
was
significant
(
p
=
0.0004
;
odds
ratio
=
0.974
)
and
increasing
the
IP
infusion
time
of
bupropion
HCl
120
mg
/
kg
was
associated
with
a
91
%
reduced
odds
of
convulsions
at
infusion
times
of
15
to
90
min
compared
to
bolus
injection
.

Further
increase
in
infusion
time
resulted
in
further
reduction
in
the
odds
of
convulsions
to
99.8
%
reduction
at
240
min
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
conclusion
,
the
demonstration
of
an
inverse
relationship
between
infusion
time
of
a
fixed
and
convulsive
dose
of
bupropion
and
the
risk
of
convulsions
in
a
prospective
study
is
novel
.

Detailed
spectral
profile
analysis
of
penicillin
-induced
epileptiform
activity
in
anesthetized
rats
.

Penicillin
model
is
a
widely
used
experimental
model
for
epilepsy
research
.

In
the
present
study
we
aimed
to
portray
a
detailed
spectral
analysis
of
penicillin
-induced

epileptiform
activity
in
comparison
with
basal
brain
activity
in
anesthetized
Wistar
rats
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
anesthetized
with
i.p
.

urethane
and
connected
to
an
electrocorticogram
setup
.

After
a
short
period
of
basal
activity
recording
,
epileptic
focus
was
induced
by
injecting
400IU/2
microl

penicillin
-
G
potassium
into
the
left
lateral
ventricle
while
the
cortical
activity
was
continuously
recorded
.

Basal
activity
,
latent
period
and
the
penicillin
-induced

epileptiform
activity
periods
were
then
analyzed
using
both
conventional
methods
and
spectral
analysis
.

Spectral
analyses
were
conducted
by
dividing
the
whole
spectrum
into
different
frequency
bands
including
delta
,
theta
(
slow
and
fast
)
,
alpha
-
sigma
,
beta
(
1
and
2
)
and
gamma
(
1
and
2
)
bands
.

Our
results
show
that
the
most
affected
frequency
bands
were
delta
,
theta
,
beta-2
and
gamma-2
bands
during
the
epileptiform
activity
and
there
were
marked
differences
in
terms
of
spectral
densities
between
three
investigated
episodes
(
basal
activity
,
latent
period
and
epileptiform
activity
)
.

Our
results
may
help
to
analyze
novel
data
obtained
using
similar
experimental
models
and
the
simple
analysis
method
described
here
can
be
used
in
similar
studies
to
investigate
the
basic
neuronal
mechanism
of
this
or
other
types
of
experimental
epilepsies
.

High
dose

dexmedetomidine
as
the
sole
sedative
for
pediatric
MRI
.

OBJECTIVE
:

This
large
-
scale
retrospective
review
evaluates
the
sedation
profile
of
dexmedetomidine
.

AIM
:
To
determine
the
hemodynamic
responses
,
efficacy
and
adverse
events
associated
with
the
use
of
high
dose
dexmedetomidine
as
the
sole
sedative
for
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
MRI
)
studies
.

BACKGROUND
:

Dexmedetomidine
has
been
used
at
our
institution
since
2005
to
provide
sedation
for
pediatric
radiological
imaging
studies
.

Over
time
,
an
effective
protocol
utilizing
high
dose
dexmedetomidine
as
the
sole
sedative
agent
has
evolved
.

METHODS
/
MATERIALS
:

As
part
of
the
ongoing
Quality
Assurance
process
,
data
on
all
sedations
are
reviewed
monthly
and
protocols
modified
as
needed
.

Data
were
analyzed
from
all
747
consecutive
patients
who
received
dexmedetomidine
for
MRI
sedation
from
April
2005
to
April
2007
.

RESULTS
:

Since
2005
,
the
10-min
loading
dose
of
our
dexmedetomidine
protocol
increased
from
2
to
3
microg.kg(-1
)
,
and
the
infusion
rate
increased
from
1
to
1.5
to
2
microg.kg(-1).h(-1
)
.

The
current
sedation
protocol
progressively
increased
the
rate
of
successful
sedation
(
able
to
complete
the
imaging
study
)
when
using
dexmedetomidine
alone
from
91.8
%
to
97.6
%
(
P
=
0.009
)
,
reducing
the
requirement
for
adjuvant
pentobarbital
in
the
event
of
sedation
failure
with
dexmedetomidine
alone
and
decreased
the
mean
recovery
time
by
10
min
(
P
0.001
)
.

Although
dexmedetomidine
sedation
was
associated
with
a
16
%
incidence
of
bradycardia
,
all
concomitant
mean
arterial
blood
pressures
were
within
20
%
of
age
-
adjusted
normal
range
and
oxygen
saturations
were
95
%
or
higher
.

CONCLUSION
:

Dexmedetomidine
in
high
doses
provides
adequate
sedation
for
pediatric
MRI
studies
.

While
use
of
high
dose

dexmedetomidine
is
associated
with
decreases
in
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
outside
the
established
'
awake
'
norms
,
this
deviation
is
generally
within
20
%
of
norms
,
and
is
not
associated
with
adverse
sequelae
.

Dexmedetomidine
is
useful
as
the
sole
sedative
for
pediatric
MRI
.

Methamphetamine
causes
alterations
in
the
MAP
kinase
-
related
pathways
in
the
brains
of
mice
that
display
increased

aggressiveness
.

Aggressive
behaviors
have
been
reported
in
patients
who
suffer
from
some
psychiatric
disorders
,
and
are
common
in
methamphetamine

(
METH
)
abusers
.

Herein
,
we
report
that
multiple
(
but
not
single
)
injections
of
METH
significantly
increased
aggressiveness
in
male
CD-1
mice
.

This
increase
in
aggressiveness
was
not
secondary
to
METH

-induced

hyperactivity
.

Analysis
of
protein
expression
using
antibody
microarrays
and
Western
blotting
revealed
differential
changes
in
MAP
kinase
-
related
pathways
after
multiple
and
single
METH
injections
.

There
were
statistically
significant
(
p<0.05
)
decreases
in
MEK1
,
Erk2p
,
GSK3alpha
,
14
-
3
-
3e
,
and
MEK7
in
the
striata
of
mice
after
multiple
injections
of
METH
.

MEK1
was
significantly
decreased
also
after
a
single
injection
of
METH
,
but
to
a
much
lesser
degree
than
after
multiple
injections
of
METH
.

In
the
frontal
cortex
,
there
was
a
statistically
significant
decrease
in
GSK3alpha
after
multiple
(
but
not
single
)
injections
of
METH
.

These
findings
suggest
that
alterations
in
MAP
kinase
-
related
pathways
in
the
prefronto
-
striatal
circuitries
might
be
involved
in
the
manifestation
of
aggressive
behaviors
in
mice
.

Lamotrigine
associated
with
exacerbation
or
de

myoclonus
in
idiopathic
generalized
epilepsies
.

Five
patients
with
idiopathic
generalized
epilepsies

(
IGE
)
treated
with
lamotrigine

(
LTG
)
experienced
exacerbation
or
de
novo
appearance
of
myoclonic
jerks

(
MJ
)
.

In
three
patients
,
LTG
exacerbated

MJ
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
with
early
aggravation
during
titration
.

MJ
disappeared
when
LTG
dose
was
decreased
by
25
to
50
%
.

In
two
patients
,
LTG
exacerbated

MJ
in
a
delayed
but
more
severe
manner
,
with
myoclonic
status
that
only
ceased
after
LTG
withdrawal
.

rTMS
of
supplementary
motor
area
modulates
therapy
-
induced
dyskinesias
in
Parkinson
disease
.

The
neural
mechanisms
and
circuitry
involved
in
levodopa

-induced

dyskinesia
are
unclear
.

Using
repetitive
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
(
rTMS
)
over
the
supplementary
motor
area
(
SMA
)
in
a
group
of
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson
disease
,
the
authors
investigated
whether
modulation
of
SMA
excitability
may
result
in
a
modification
of
a
dyskinetic
state
induced
by
continuous
apomorphine
infusion
.

rTMS
at
1

Hz
was
observed
to
markedly
reduce
drug
-
induced
dyskinesias
,
whereas
5-Hz
rTMS
induced
a
slight
but
not
significant
increase
.

Assessment
of
the
onset
and
persistence
of
amnesia
during
procedural
sedation
with
propofol
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
assess
patients
'
ability
to
repeat
and
recall
words
presented
to
them
while
undergoing
procedural
sedation
with
propofol
,
and
correlate
their
recall
with
their
level
of
awareness
as
measured
by
bispectral
index
(
BIS
)
monitoring
.

METHODS
:

This
was
a
prospective
,
single
-
intervention
study
of
consenting
adult
patients
undergoing
procedural
sedation
with
propofol
between
December
28
,
2002
,
and
October
31
,
2003
.

BIS
monitoring
was
initiated
starting
3
minutes
before
the
procedure
and
continuing
until
the
patient
had
regained
baseline
mental
status
.

At
1-minute
intervals
during
the
procedural
sedation
,
until
the
patient
regained
baseline
mental
status
at
the
end
of
the
procedure
,
a
word
from
a
standardized
list
was
read
aloud
,
and
the
patient
was
asked
to
immediately
repeat
the
word
to
the
investigator
.

The
BIS
score
at
the
time
the
word
was
read
and
the
patient
's
ability
to
repeat
the
word
were
recorded
.

After
the
procedure
,
the
patient
was
asked
to
state
all
of
the
words
from
the
list
that
he
or
she
could
recall
,
and
to
identify
the
last
word
recalled
from
prior
to
the
start
of
the
procedure
and
the
first
word
recalled
from
after
the
procedure
was
completed
.

RESULTS
:

Seventy
-
five
consenting
patients
were
enrolled
;
one
patient
was
excluded
from
data
analysis
for
a
protocol
violation
.

No
serious
adverse
events
were
noted
during
the
procedural
sedations
.

The
mean
(
+
/-standard
deviation
)
time
of
data
collection
was
16.4
minutes
(
+
/-7.1
;
range
5
to
34
minutes
)
.

The
mean
initial
(
preprocedure
)

BIS
score
was
97.1
(
+
/-2.3
;
range
92
to
99
)
.

The
mean
lowest
BIS
score
occurring
during
these
procedural
sedations
was
66.9
(
+
/-14.4
;
range
33
to
91
)
.

The
mean
lowest
BIS
score
corresponding
to
the
ability
of
the
patient
to
immediately
repeat
words
read
from
the
list
was
77.1
(
95
%
CI
=
74.3
to
80.0
)
.

The
mean
highest
BIS
score
corresponding
to
the
inability
to
repeat
words
was
81.5
(
95
%
CI
=
78.1
to
84.8
)
.

The
mean
BIS
score
corresponding
to
the
last
word
recalled
from
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
sedation
was
96.7
(
+
/-2.4
;
range
84
to
98
)
.

The
mean
BIS
score
corresponding
to
the
first
word
recalled
after
the
procedure
was
completed
was
91.2
(
95
%
CI
=
88.1
to
94.3
)
.

All
patients
recalled
at
least
one
word
that
had
been
read
to
them
during
the
protocol
.

The
mean
lowest
BIS
score
for
any
recalled
word
was
91.5
(
+
/-11.1
;
range
79
to
98
)
,
and
no
words
were
recalled
when
the
corresponding
BIS
score
was
less
than
90
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

There
is
a
range
of
BIS
scores
during
which
sedated
patients
are
able
to
repeat
words
read
to
them
but
are
not
able
to
subsequently
recall
these
words
.

Furthermore
,
patients
had
no
recall
of
words
repeated
prior
to
procedural
sedation
in
BIS
ranges
associated
with
recall
after
procedural
sedation
,
suggestive
of

Assessment
of
perinatal
hepatitis
B
and
rubella
prevention
in
New
Hampshire
delivery
hospitals
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
evaluate
current
performance
on
recommended
perinatal
hepatitis
B
and
rubella
prevention
practices
in
New
Hampshire
.

METHODS
:
Data
were
extracted
from
2021
paired
mother
-
infant
records
for
the
year
2000
birth
cohort
in
New
Hampshire
's
25
delivery
hospitals
.

Assessment
was
done
on
the
following
:
prenatal
screening
for
hepatitis
B
and
rubella
,
administration
of
the
hepatitis
B
vaccine
birth
dose
to
all
infants
,
administration
of
hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
to
infants
who
were
born
to
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen
-positive
mothers
,
rubella
immunity
,
and
administration
of
in
-
hospital
postpartum
rubella
vaccine
to
rubella
nonimmune
women
.

RESULTS
:

Prenatal
screening
rates
for
hepatitis
B
(
98.8
%
)
and
rubella
(
99.4
%
)
were
high
.

Hepatitis
B
vaccine
birth
dose
was
administered
to
76.2
%
of
all
infants
.

All
infants
who
were
born
to
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen
-positive
mothers
also
received
hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
.

Multivariate
logistic
regression
showed
that
the
month
of
delivery
and
infant
birth
weight
were
independent
predictors
of
hepatitis
B
vaccination
.

The
proportion
of
infants
who
were
vaccinated
in
January
and
February
2000
(
48.5
%
and
67.5
%
,
respectively
)
was
less
than
any
other
months
,
whereas
the
proportion
who
were
vaccinated
in
December
2000
(
88.2
%
)
was
the
highest
.

Women
who
were
born
between
1971
and
1975
had
the
highest
rate
of
rubella
nonimmunity
(
9.5
%
)
.

In
-
hospital
postpartum
rubella

vaccine
administration
was
documented
for
75.6
%
of
nonimmune
women
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
study
documents
good
compliance
in
New
Hampshire
's
birthing
hospitals
with
national
guidelines
for
perinatal
hepatitis
B
and
rubella
prevention
and
highlights
potential
areas
for
improvement

Expression
of
p300
protects
cardiac
myocytes
from
apoptosis
in
vivo
.

Doxorubicin
is
an
anti-
tumor
agent
that
represses
cardiac
-
specific
gene
expression
and
induces
myocardial
cell
apoptosis
.

Doxorubicin
depletes
cardiac
p300
,
a
transcriptional
coactivator
that
is
required
for
the
maintenance
of
the
differentiated
phenotype
of
cardiac
myocytes
.

However
,
the
role
of
p300
in
protection
against
doxorubicin
-induced
apoptosis
is
unknown
.

Transgenic
mice
overexpressing
p300
in
the
heart
and
wild
-
type
mice
were
subjected
to
doxorubicin
treatment
.

Compared
with
wild
-
type
mice
,
transgenic
mice
exhibited
higher
survival
rate
as
well
as
more
preserved
left
ventricular
function
and
cardiac
expression
of
alpha
-
sarcomeric
actin
.

Doxorubicin
induced
myocardial
cell
apoptosis
in
wild
-
type
mice
but
not
in
transgenic
mice
.

Expression
of
p300
increased
the
cardiac
level
of
bcl-2
and
mdm-2
,
but
not
that
of
p53
or
other
members
of
the
bcl-2
family
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
overexpression
of
p300
protects
cardiac
myocytes
from

doxorubicin
-induced
apoptosis
and
reduces
the
extent
of
acute
heart
failure
in
adult
mice
in
vivo
.

Mitochondrial
DNA
and
its
respiratory
chain
products
are
defective
in
doxorubicin
nephrosis
.

BACKGROUND
:

Doxorubicin
induces
a
self
-
perpetuating
nephropathy
characterized
by
early
glomerular
and
late
-
onset
tubular
lesions
in
rats
.

We
investigated
the
potential
role
of
mitochondrial
injury
in
the
onset
of
these
lesions
.

METHODS
:
Rats
were
treated
with
intravenous
doxorubicin

(
1
mg
kg(-1
)
week(-1
)
)
for
7
weeks
and
were
sacrificed
either
1
week
(
'
short
-
term
'
)
or
30
weeks
(
'
long
-
term
'
)
following
the
last
dose
.

Additional
rats
received
a
single
dose
either
6
days
or
2
h
prior
to
euthanasia
.

All
rats
were
killed
at
48
weeks
of
age
.

Glomerular
and
tubular
injury
was
monitored
and
correlated
to
the
activity
or
expression
of
respiratory
chain
components
.

Finally
,
we
quantified
both
nuclear
and
mitochondrial
DNA
(
mtDNA
)
as
well
as
superoxide
production
and
the
4834
base
pair
'
common
'
mtDNA
deletion
.

RESULTS
:

The
'
long
-
term
'
group
had
significant
glomerular
and
tubular
lesions
,
depressed
activities
of
mtDNA
-
encoded
NADH
dehydrogenase
and
cytochrome
-
c
oxidase
(
COX
)
and
increased
citrate
synthase
activity
.

In
addition
,
expression
of
the
mtDNA
-
encoded
COX
subunit
I
was
reduced
and
mtDNA
levels
were
decreased
.

In
'
short
-
term
'
rats
,
there
were
fewer
tubular
lesions
,
but
similar
numbers
of
glomerular
lesions
activity
.

Among
all
animals
,
glomerular
and
tubular
injury
were
inversely
correlated
with
mtDNA
levels
,
mtDNA
-
encoded
respiratory
chain
activities
and
with
the
expression
of
the
mtDNA
-
encoded
respiratory
chain
subunit
COX
-
I.
Injury
was
positively
correlated
with
superoxide
production
and
the
activities
of
nucleus
-
encoded
mitochondrial
or
cytoplasmic
enzymes
.

Kidneys
from
the
'
long
-
term
'
group
showed
more
mtDNA
deletions
than
in
'
short
-
term
'
animals
and
these
were
not
observed
in
the
other
groups
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
results
suggest
an
important
role
for
quantitative
and
qualitative
mtDNA
alterations
through
the
reduction
of
mtDNA
-
encoded
respiratory
chain
function
and
induction
of
superoxide
in
doxorubicin

Amphotericin
B
-induced
seizures
in
a
patient
with
AIDS
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
multiple
episodes
of
seizure
activity
in
an
AIDS
patent
following
amphotericin
B
infusion
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
46-year
-
old
African
-
American
man
experienced
recurrent
grand
mal
seizures
during
intravenous
infusion
of
amphotericin
B
,
then
petit
mal
seizures
as
the
infusion
was
stopped
and
the
drug
concentrations
decreased
with
time
.

The
patients
concurrent
medications
included
didanosine
,
hydroxyzine
,
promethazine
,
hydrocortisone
,
and
prochlorperazine
.

Despite
administration
of
phenytoin
and
lorazepam
,
the
seizures
persisted
and
occurred
only
during
amphotercin
B
administration
.

DISCUSSION
:

AIDS
and
cryptococcal
meningitis
,
both
of
which
the
patient
had
,
can
potentially
cause
seizures
.

The
patient
had
a
history
of
alcohol
abuse
;
alcohol
intake
as
well
as
withdrawal
can
also
cause
seizures
.

Didanosine
also
has
a
potential
for
inducing
seizures
.

However
,
these
other
potential
causes
of
seizure
were
ruled
out
.

The
time
course
of
events
suggested
that
amphotericin
B
was
the
cause
of
the
seizures
in
this
AIDS
patient
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Amphotericin
B
seems
to
be
the
probable
cause
of
the
seizures
.

To
date
,
only
three
cases
of
seizures
associated
with
amphotericin
B
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
,
but
healthcare
providers
should
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
this
rare
adverse
effect
.

Therapeutic
drug
monitoring
of
tobramycin
:

once

daily
versus
twice
-
daily
dosage
schedules
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
evaluate
the
effect
of
dosage
regimen
(
once
-
daily
vs.
twice
-
daily
)
of

tobramicyn
on
steady
-
state
serum
concentrations
and
toxicity
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

Patients
undergoing
treatment
with
i.v
.

tobramycin
(
4
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
were
randomised
to
two
groups
.

Group
OD
(
n
=
22
)
received
a
once
-
daily
dose
of
tobramycin
and
group
TD

(
n
=
21
)
received
the
same
dose
divided
into
two
doses
daily
.

Tobramycin
serum
concentrations
(
peak
and
trough
)
were
measured
by
enzyme
multiplied
immunoassay
.

The
renal
and
auditory
functions
of
the
patients
were
monitored
before
,
during
and
immediately
after
treatment
.

RESULTS
:

The
two
groups
were
comparable
with
respect
to
sex
,
age
,
body
weight
and
renal
function
.

No
statistically
significant
differences
were
found
in
mean
daily
dose
,
duration
of
treatment
,
or
cumulative
dose
.

Trough
concentrations
were
2
g
/
ml
in
the
two
groups
(
100
%
)
.

Peak
concentrations
were
>
6
microg
/
ml
in
100
%
of
the
OD
group
and
in
67
%
of
the
TD
group
(
P
0.01
)
.

Mean
peak
concentrations
were
markedly
different
:

11.00+/-2.89
microg
/
ml
in
OD
vs.
6.53+/-1.45
microg
/
ml
in
TD
(
P
0.01
)
.

The
pharmacokinetics
parameters
were
:
Ke
,
(
0.15+/-0.03/h
in
OD
vs.
0.24+/-0.06/h
in
TD
)
,
t1/2
,
(
4.95+/-1.41
h
in
OD
vs.
3.07+/-0.71
h
in
TD
)
,
Vd
(
0.35+/-0.11
l
/
kg
in
OD
vs.
0.33+/-0.09
l
/
kg
in
TD
)
,
Cl

(
0.86+/-0.29
ml
/
min
/
kg
in
OD
vs.
1.28+/-0.33
ml
/
min
/
kg
in
TD
)
.

Increased
serum

creatinine
was
observed
in
73
%
of
patients
in
OD
versus
57
%
of
patients
in
TD
,
without
evidence
of
nephrotoxicity
.

In
TD
group
,
three
patients
developed
decreased
auditory
function
,
of
which
one
presented
with
an
auditory
loss
of
-30
dB
,
whereas
in
the
OD
group
only
one
patient
presented
decreased
auditory
function
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
small
study
suggests
that
a
once
-
daily
dosing
regimen
of
tobramycin
is
at
least
as
effective
as
and
is
no
more
and
possibly
less
toxic
than
the
twice
-
daily
regimen
.

Using
a
single
-
dose
therapy
,
peak
concentration
determination
is
not
necessary
,
only
trough
samples
should
be
monitored
to
ensure
levels
below
2
microg

.

Chronic
effects
of
a
novel
synthetic
anthracycline
derivative
(
SM-5887
)
on
normal
heart
and

doxorubicin
-induced

cardiomyopathy
in
beagle
dogs
.

This
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
chronic
cardiotoxic
potential
of
SM-5887
and
a
possible
deteriorating
effect
of
SM-5887
on
low
-
grade
cardiotoxicity
pre
-
induced
by
doxorubicin
in
beagle
dogs
.

In
the
chronic
treatment
,
beagle
dogs
of
each
sex
were
given
intravenously
once
every
3
weeks
,
either
a
sublethal
dose
of
doxorubicin

(
1.5
mg
/
kg
)
or
SM-5887
(
2.5
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
experiment
was
terminated
3
weeks
after
the
ninth
dosing
.

Animals
which
received
over
six
courses
of
doxorubicin
demonstrated
the
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
changes
,
decrease
of
blood
pressure
and
high
-
grade
histopathological
cardiomyopathy
,
while
animals
which
were
terminally
sacrificed
after
the
SM-5887
administration
did
not
show
any
changes
in
ECG
,
blood
pressure
and
histopathological
examinations
.

To
examine
a
possibly
deteriorating
cardiotoxic
effect
of
SM-5887
,
low
-
grade

cardiomyopathy
was
induced
in
dogs
by
four
courses
of
doxorubicin

(
1.5
mg
/
kg
)
.

Nine
weeks
after
pre
-
treatment
,
dogs
were
given
four
courses
of
either
doxorubicin

(
1.5
mg
/
kg
)
or
SM-5887
(
2.5
mg
/
kg
)
once
every
3
weeks
.

The
low
-
grade
cardiotoxic
changes
were
enhanced
by
the
additional
doxorubicin
treatment
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
SM-5887
treatment
did
not
progress
the
grade
of
cardiomyopathy
.

In
conclusion
,
SM-5887
does
not
have
any
potential
of
chronic
cardiotoxicity
and
deteriorating
effect
on
doxorubicin
-induced

Posteroventral
medial
pallidotomy
in
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
.

BACKGROUND
:

Posteroventral
medial
pallidotomy
sometimes
produces
striking
improvement
in
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
,
but
the
studies
to
date
have
involved
small
numbers
of
patients
and
short
-
term
follow
-
up
.

METHODS
:

Forty
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease

underwent
serial
,
detailed
assessments
both
after
drug
withdrawal
(
"
off
"
period
)
and
while
taking
their
optimal
medical
regimens
(
"
on
"
period
)
.

All
patients
were
examined
preoperatively
and
39
were
examined
at
six
months
;
27
of
the
patients
were
also
examined
at
one
year
,
and
11
at
two
years
.

RESULTS
:

The
percent
improvements
at
six
months
were
as
follows
:
off
-
period
score
for
overall
motor
function
,
28
percent
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
19
to
38
percent
)
,
with
most
of
the
improvement
in
the
contralateral
limbs
;
off
-
period
score
for
activities
of
daily
living
,
29
percent
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
19
to
39
percent
)
;
on
-
period
score
for
contralateral
dyskinesias
,
82
percent
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
72
to
91
percent
)
;
and
on
-
period
score
for
ipsilateral
dyskinesias
,
44
percent
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
29
to
59
percent
)
.

The
improvements
in
dyskinesias
and
the
total
scores
for
off
-
period
parkinsonism
,
contralateral
bradykinesia
,
and
rigidity
were
sustained
in
the
11
patients
examined
at
two
years
.

The
improvement
in
ipsilateral
dyskinesias
was
lost
after
one
year
,
and
the
improvements
in
postural
stability
and
gait
lasted
only
three
to
six
months
.

Approximately
half
the
patients
who
had
been
dependent
on
assistance
in
activities
of
daily
living
in
the
off
period
before
surgery
became
independent
after
surgery
.

The
complications
of
surgery
were
generally
well
tolerated
,
and
there
were
no
significant
changes
in
the
use
of
medication
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
late
-
stage
Parkinson
's
disease
,
pallidotomy
significantly
reduces
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
and
off
-
period
disability
.

Much
of
the
benefit
is
sustained
at
two
years
,
although
some
improvements
,
such
as
those
on
the
ipsilateral
side
and
in
axial
symptoms
,
wane
within
the
first
year
.

The
on
-
period
symptoms
that
are
resistant
to
dopaminergic
therapy
do
not
respond
to
pallidotomy
.

Neuropeptide
-
Y
immunoreactivity
in
the
pilocarpine
model
of
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
.

Neuropeptide
-
Y
(
NPY
)
is
expressed
by
granule
cells
and
mossy
fibres
of
the
hippocampal
dentate
gyrus
during
experimental
temporal
lobe
epilepsy

(
TLE
)
.

This
expression
may
represent
an
endogenous
damping
mechanism
since
NPY
has
been
shown
to
block
seizure
-like
events
following
high
-
frequency
stimulation
in
hippocampal
slices
.

The
pilocarpine

(
PILO
)
model
of
epilepsy
is
characterized
by
an
acute
period
of
status
epilepticus
followed
by
spontaneous
recurrent
seizures
and
related
brain
damage
.

We
report
peroxidase
-
antiperoxidase
immunostaining
for
NPY
in
several
brain
regions
in
this
model
.

PILO
-injected
animals
exhibited
NPY
immunoreactivity
in
the
region
of
the
mossy
fibre
terminals
,
in
the
dentate
gyrus
inner
molecular
layer
and
,
in
a
few
cases
,
within
presumed
granule
cells
.

NPY
immunoreactivity
was
also
dramatically
changed
in
the
entorhinal
cortex
,
amygdala
and
sensorimotor
areas
.

In
addition
,
PILO
injected
animals
exhibited
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
NPY
-
immunoreactive
interneurons
compared
with
controls
.

The
results
demonstrate
that
changes
in
NPY
expression
,
including
expression
in
the
granule
cells
and
mossy
fibres
and
the
loss
of
vulnerable
NPY
neurons
,
are
present
in
the
PILO
model
of
TLE
.

However
,
the
significance
of
this
changed
synthesis
of
NPY
remains
to
be
determined
.

Effect
of
myopic
excimer
laser
photorefractive
keratectomy
on
the
electrophysiologic
function
of
the
retina
and
optic
nerve
.

PURPOSE
:

To
assess
by
electrophysiologic
testing
the
effect
of
photorefractive
keratectomy
(
PRK
)
on
the
retina
and
optic
nerve
.

SETTING
:

Eye
Clinic
,
S.
Salvatore
Hospital
,
L'Aquila
University
,
Italy
.

METHODS
:

Standard
pattern
electroretinograms
(
P
-
ERGs
)
and
standard
pattern
visual
evoked
potentials
(
P
-
VEPs
)
were
done
in
25
eyes
of
25
patients
who
had
myopic
PRK
for
an
attempted
correction
between
5.00
and
15.00
diopters
(
D
)

(
mean
8.00
D
)
.

Testing
was
done
preoperatively
and
3
,
6
,
12
,
and
18
months
postoperatively
.

The
contralateral
eyes
served
as
controls
.

During
the
follow
-
up
,
3
patients
(
12
%
)
developed

steroid
-induced

elevated
intraocular
pressure

(
IOP
)
that
resolved
after
corticosteroid

therapy
was
discontinued
.

RESULTS
:

No
statistically
significant
differences
were
seen
between
treated
and
control
eyes
nor
between
treated
eyes
preoperatively
and
postoperatively
.

CONCLUSION
:

Myopic
excimer
laser
PRK
did
not
seem
to
affect
the
posterior
segment
.

The
transient
steroid
-induced
IOP
rise
did
not
seem
to
cause
functional
impairment
.

Liposomal
daunorubicin
in
advanced
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
:
a
phase
II
study
.

We
report
a
non
-
randomized
Phase
II
clinical
trial
to
assess
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
liposomal
daunorubicin

(
DaunoXome
)
in
the
treatment
of

AIDS
related
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
.

Eleven
homosexual
men
with
advanced
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
were
entered
in
the
trial
.

Changes
in
size
,
colour
and
associated
oedema
of
selected
'
target
'
lesions
were
measured
.

Clinical
,
biochemical
and
haematological
toxicities
were
assessed
.

Ten
subjects
were
evaluated
.

A
partial
response
was
achieved
in
four
,
of
whom
two
subsequently
relapsed
.

Stabilization
of
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
occurred
in
the
remaining
six
,
maintained
until
the
end
of
the
trial
period
in
four
.

The
drug
was
generally
well
tolerated
,
with
few
mild
symptoms
of
toxicity
.

The
main
problem
encountered
was
haematological
toxicity
,
with
three
subjects
experiencing
severe
neutropenia

(
neutrophil
count
0.5
x
10(9)/l
)
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
cardiotoxicity
.

In
this
small
patient
sample
,
liposomal
daunorubicin
was
an
effective
and
well
tolerated
agent
in
the
treatment
of
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
.

Failure
of
ancrod
in
the
treatment
of
heparin
-induced
arterial
thrombosis
.

The
morbidity
and
mortality
associated
with

heparin
-induced

thrombosis
remain
high
despite
numerous
empirical
therapies
.

Ancrod
has
been
used
successfully
for
prophylaxis
against
development
of
thrombosis
in
patients
with
heparin
induced
platelet
aggregation
who
require
brief
reexposure
to
heparin
,
but
its
success
in
patients
who
have
developed
the
thrombosis
syndrome
is
not
well
defined
.

The
authors
present
a
case
of
failure
of
ancrod
treatment
in
a
patient
with
heparin
-induced
thrombosis
.

Seizure
after
flumazenil
administration
in
a
pediatric
patient
.

Flumazenil
is
a
benzodiazepine
receptor
antagonist
used
to
reverse
sedation
and
respiratory
depression
induced
by
benzodiazepines
.

Seizures
and
cardiac
arrhythmias
have
complicated
its
use
in
adult
patients
.

Overdose
patients
who
have
coingested
tricyclic
antidepressants
have
a
higher
risk
of
these
complications
.

Little
information
exists
concerning
adverse
effects
of
flumazenil
in
children
.

We
report
the
occurrence
of
a
generalized
tonic
-
clonic
seizure
in
a
pediatric
patient
following
the
administration
of
flumazenil
.

distinguishable
from
the

There
was
also
evidence
of
a
subtle

on
the
entire

Induction
of
ventricular
fibrillation
and
decrease
of
aortic
pressure
.

In
twenty
beagle
dogs
selective
injections
were
made
into
the
left
coronary
artery
with
iopentol
,

iohexol
and
metrizoate
in
doses
of
4
ml
,
8
ml
and
16
ml
.

Thirty
-
six

iopentol
injections
,
35
iohexol
injections
and
37
metrizoate
injections
were
made
.

Frequencies
of
ventricular

were
significantly
lower
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
after
iopentol
(
0
%
)
and
iohexol
(
3
%
)
than
after
metrizoate
(
22
%
)
.

Iopentol
and
iohexol
also
produced
significantly
less
decrease
in
aortic
blood
pressure
than
metrizoate
at
the
different

.

Magnetic

imaging
of
cerebral
venous
thrombosis
secondary
to
"
low

.

The
clinical
and
radiographic
features
of
cerebral
deep
venous
thrombosis
in
a
21-year
-
old
white
woman
are
presented
.

This
nulliparous
patient
presented
with
relatively
mild
clinical
symptoms
and
progressing
mental
status
changes
.

The
only
known
risk
factor
was
"
low
-

"
oral
contraceptive
pills
.

The
magnetic

image
(
MRI
)
showed
increased
signal
intensity
from
the
internal
cerebral
veins
,
vein
of
Galen
,
and
straight
sinus
.

The
diagnosis
was
confirmed
by
arterial
angiography

Relation
of
perfusion
defects
observed
with
myocardial
contrast
echocardiography
to
the
severity
of
coronary
stenosis
:
correlation
with
thallium
-201
single
-
photon
emission
tomography
.

It
has
been
previously
shown
that
myocardial
contrast
echocardiography
is
a
valuable
technique
for
delineating
regions
of
myocardial
underperfusion
secondary
to
coronary
occlusion
and
to
critical
coronary
stenoses
in
the
presence
of
hyperemic
stimulation
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
myocardial
contrast
echocardiography
performed
with
a
stable
solution
of
sonicated
albumin
could
detect
regions
of
myocardial
underperfusion
resulting
from
various
degrees
of
coronary
stenosis
.

The
perfusion
defect
produced
in
16
open
chest
dogs
was
compared
with
the
anatomic
area
at
risk
measured
by
the
postmortem
dual
-
perfusion
technique
and
with
thallium
-201
single
-
photon
emission
tomography
(
SPECT
)
.

During
a
transient
(
20-s
)
coronary
occlusion
,
a
perfusion
defect
was
observed
with
contrast
echocardiography
in
14
of
the
15
dogs
in
which
the
occlusion
was
produced
.

The
perfusion
defect
correlated
significantly
with
the
anatomic
area
at
risk
(
r
=
0.74
;
p
less
than
0.002
)
.

During
dipyridamole

-induced

hyperemia
,
12
of
the
16
dogs
with
a
partial
coronary
stenosis
had
a
visible
area
of
hypoperfusion
by
contrast
echocardiography
.

The
four
dogs
without
a
perfusion
defect
had
a
stenosis
that
resulted
in
a
mild
(
0
%
to
50
%
)
reduction
in
dipyridamole
-induced
hyperemia
.

The
size
of
the
perfusion
defect
during
stenosis
correlated
significantly
with
the
anatomic
area
at
risk
(
r
=
0.61
;
p
=
0.02
)
.

Thallium
-201
SPECT
demonstrated
a
perfusion
defect
in
all
14
dogs
analyzed
during
dipyridamole

-induced

hyperemia
;
the
size
of
the
perfusion
defect
correlated
with
the
anatomic
area
at
risk
(
r
=
0.58
;
p
less
than
0.03
)
and
with
the
perfusion
defect
by
contrast
echocardiography
(
r
=
0.58
;
p
less
than
0.03
)
.

Thus
,
myocardial
contrast
echocardiography
can
be
used
to
visualize
and
quantitate
the
amount
of
jeopardized
myocardium
during
moderate
to
severe
degrees
of
coronary
stenosis
.

The
results
obtained
show
a
correlation
with
the
anatomic
area
at
risk
similar
to
that
obtained
with

thallium
-201
SPECT
.

Potential
deleterious
effect
of
furosemide
in
radiocontrast
nephropathy
.

The
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
furosemide
in
addition
to
intravenous
fluids
in
the
prevention
of
radiocontrast
nephropathy
.

18
patients
,
referred
to
a
radiocontrast
study
,
considered
at
risk
because
of
preexisting
renal
insufficiency
,
were
enrolled
in
a
prospective
,
randomized
,
controlled
trial
,
performed
at
the
secondary
care
center
of
a
1,100-bed
private
university
hospital
.

In
addition
to
fluids
,
the
treatment
group
received
furosemide

(
mean
dose
110
mg
)

intravenously
30
min
prior
to
the
injection
of
contrast
material
.

The
control
group
received
fluids
(
mean
3
liters
)
.

Radiological
studies
were
mostly
angiographies
performed
with
both
ionic
and
non

ionic
contrast
material
,
at
an
average
dose
of
245
ml
.

Renal
function
significantly
deteriorated
in
the
group
pretreated
with
furosemide

(
p
0.005
by
ANOVA
)
,
with
a
rise
in

the
control
group
(
from
141
+
/-
6
to
142
+
/-
7
mumol
/

)
.

Renal
failure
was
associated
with
weight
loss
in
the
furosemide

in
the
pathogenesis
of
liver
tumors
associated
with
oral

.

Within
the
last
several
years
,
previously
rare
liver
tumors
have
been
seen
in
young
women
using
oral

steroids
.

The
Registry
for
Liver
Tumors

Associated
with
Oral
Contraceptives
at
the
University
of
California
,
Irvine
,
has
clearly
identified
27
cases
.

The
recent
literature
contains
44
case
reports
.

Common
to
these
71
cases
has
been
a
histopathologic
diagnosis
of
focal

,
adenoma
,
hamartoma
,
and

.

Significant
statistical
etiologic
factors
include
prolonged
uninterrupted

in
24
patients
(

occurred
in

patients
(
29
%

,
with
2
cases
of

.

The
study
was
terminated
prematurely
because
an
additional
6
patients
(
25

Although
this
new

appears
to
be
effective
as
a

Effect
of
some
convulsants
on
the
protective
activity
of
loreclezole
and
its
combinations
with
valproate
or
clonazepam
in
amygdala
-
kindled
rats
.

Loreclezole
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
exerted
a
significant
protective
action
in
amygdala
-
kindled
rats
,
reducing
both
seizure
and
afterdischarge
durations
.

The
combinations
of
loreclezole
(
2.5
mg
/
kg
)
with
valproate
,
clonazepam
,
or
carbamazepine
(
applied
at
their
subprotective
doses
)
also
exhibited
antiseizure
effect
in
this
test
.

However
,
only
two
first
combinations
occurred
to
be
of
pharmacodynamic
nature
.

Among

methyl
-
D
-
aspartic
acid
and
BAY
k-8644
(
the
opener
of
L
-
type
calcium
channels
)
reversed
the
protective
activity
of
loreclezole
alone
and
its
combination
with
valproate
.

On
the
other
hand
,
bicuculline
,
aminophylline
and
BAY
k-8644
inhibited
the
anticonvulsive
action
of
loreclezole
combined
with
clonazepam
.

The
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
protective
activity
of
loreclezole
and
its
combinations
with
other
antiepileptics
may
involve
potentiation
of
GABAergic

Acute
liver
failure
with
concurrent
bupropion
and
carbimazole
therapy
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
fatal
liver
failure
possibly
associated
with
concurrent
use
of
bupropion
and
carbimazole
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
41-year
-
old
Chinese
man
with
a
history
of
hyperthyroidism
had
been
treated
with
carbimazole
and
propranolol
for
the
past
5
years
.

He
received
a
10-day
course
of
bupropion
as
an
aid
for
smoking
cessation
10
weeks
prior
to
presentation
.

He
developed
acute
liver
failure
with
rapid
deterioration
of
renal
function
.

Liver
biopsy
showed
evidence
of
nonspecific
drug
-
induced
acute
liver
injury
.

His
condition
was
further
complicated
by
sepsis
and
coagulopathy
.

Death
resulted
19
days
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
.

The
likelihood
that
bupropion
induced
hepatotoxicity
in
our
patient
was
possible
,
based
on
the
Naranjo
probability
scale
.

DISCUSSION
:

Although
there
is
increasing
evidence
of
hepatotoxicity
induced
by
bupropion
,
this
is
the
first
case
of
fatality
that
could
have
resulted
from
acute
liver
failure
in
a
patient
receiving
bupropion
while
on
concomitant
treatment
with
carbimazole
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Clinicians
should
be
aware
of
the
possibility
of
acute
liver
insult
induced
by
bupropion
given
concurrently
with
other
hepatotoxic
drugs
.

Long
term
hormone
therapy
for
perimenopausal
and
postmenopausal
women
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hormone
therapy
(
HT
)
is
widely
used
for
controlling
menopausal
symptoms
and
has
also
been
used
for
the
management
and
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease
,
osteoporosis
and
dementia
in
older
women
.

This
is
an
updated
version
of
the
original
Cochrane
review
first
published
in
2005
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
assess
the
effect
of
long
-
term
HT
on
mortality
,
cardiovascular
outcomes
,
cancer
,
gallbladder
disease
,
cognition
,
fractures
and
quality
of
life
.

SEARCH
STRATEGY
:

We
searched
the
following
databases
to
November
2007
:
Trials

,
MEDLINE
,
EMBASE
,
Biological

.

Also
relevant
non

.

SELECTION
CRITERIA
:

Randomised
double
-
blind
trials
of
HT
versus
placebo
,
taken
for
at
least
one
year
by
perimenopausal
or
postmenopausal

.

HT
included
oestrogens
,
with
or
without
progestogens
,
via
oral

routes
.

DATA
COLLECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
:

Two
authors
independently
assessed
trial
quality
and
extracted
data
.

MAIN
RESULTS
:

Nineteen
trials
involving
41,904
women
were
included
.

In
relatively
healthy
women
,
combined
continuous
HT
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
venous
thrombo
-
embolism
or
coronary
event
(
after
one
year
's
use
)
,
stroke

(
after
three
years
)
,

breast
cancer
and

.

Long
-
term

oestrogen

-only

HT
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
venous
thrombo

embolism
,
stroke
and
gallbladder
disease
(
after
one
to
two
years
,
three
years
and
seven
years
'
use
respectively
)
,
but
did
not
significantly
increase
the
risk
of
breast
cancer
.

The
only
statistically
significant
benefits
of
HT
were
a
decreased
incidence
of
fractures
and
(
for
combined
HT
)

colon
cancer
,
with
long
-
term
use
.

Among
women
aged
over
65
who
were
relatively
healthy
(
i.e.
generally
fit
,
without
overt
disease
)
and
taking
continuous
combined
HT
,
there
was
a
statistically
significant
increase
in
the
incidence
of
dementia
.

Among
women
with
cardiovascular
disease
,
long
-
term
use
of
combined
continuous
HT
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
venous
thrombo
-
embolism

.One

trial
analysed
subgroups
of
2839
relatively
healthy
50
to
59
year
old
women
taking
combined
continuous
HT
and
1637
taking
oestrogen

-only

HT
,
versus
similar
-
sized
placebo
groups
.

The
only
significantly
increased
risk
reported
was
for
venous
thrombo
-
embolism
in
women
taking
combined
continuous
HT
:
their
absolute
risk
remained
low
,
at
less
than
1/500
.

However
,
this
study
was
not
powered
to
detect
differences
between
groups
of
younger

CONCLUSIONS
:
HT
is
not
indicated
for
the
routine
management
of

disease
.

We
need
more
evidence
on
the
safety
of
HT
for
menopausal
symptom
control
,
though
short

use
appears
to
be
relatively
safe
for

Passage
of
mannitol
into
the
brain
around
gliomas
:
a
potential
cause
of
rebound
phenomenon
.

A
study
on
21
patients
.

AIM
:
Widespread
use
of
mannitol
to
reduce
brain
edema
and
lower
elevated
ICP
in

brain
tumor
patients
continues
to
be
afflicted
by
the
so
-
called
rebound
phenomenon
.

Leakage
of
mannitol
into
the
brain
parenchyma
through
an
altered
BBB
and
secondary
reversal
of
osmotic
gradient
is
considered
the
major
cause
of
rebound
.

This
has
only
been
demonstrated
experimentally
in
animals
.

As
a
contribution
to
this
issue
we
decided
to
research
the
possible
passage
of
mannitol
into
the
brain
after
administration
to
21

brain
tumor
patients
.

METHODS
:
Mannitol

(
18
%
solution
;
1
g
/
kg
)
was
administered
as
a
bolus
to
patients
(
ten
had
malignant
glioma
,
seven
brain
metastases
and
four
meningioma
)
about
30
minutes
before
craniotomy
.

During
resection
,
a
sample
of
the
surrounding
edematous

white
matter
was
taken
at
the
same
time
as
a
10
ml
venous
blood
sample
.

Mannitol
concentrations
were
measured
in
plasma
and
white
matter
by
a
modified
version
of
the
enzyme
assay
of
Blonquist
et
al
.

RESULTS
:

In
most
glioma
patients
,
mannitol
concentrations
in
white
matter
were
2
to
6
times
higher
than
in
plasma
(
mean
3.5
times
)
.

In
meningioma
and
metastases
patients
plasma
concentrations
of
mannitol
were
higher
than
white
matter
concentrations
except
in
three
cases
with
infiltration
by
neoplastic
cells
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
results
of
our
study
show
that
even
after
a
single
bolus
,
mannitol
may
leak
through
the
altered
BBB
near
gliomas
,
reversing
the
initial
plasma
-
to
-
blood
osmotic
gradient
,
aggravating
peritumoral
edema
and
promoting
rebound
of
ICP
.

Can

of
lidocaine
pretreatment
on
reduction
of
succinylcholine
-induced

myalgia
in
patients
undergoing
general
anesthesia
for
gynecological
surgery
.

One
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
patients
were
assigned
to
one
of
three
groups
in
a
prospective
,
double
blind
,
randomized
manner
.

Group
PS
,
the
control
group
,
received
normal
saline
and
succinylcholine
1.5
mg
x
kg(-1
)
;
Group
LS
,
lidocaine
1.5
mg
x
kg(-1
)
and
succinylcholine
1.5
mg
x
kg(-1
)
;
Group
PR
,
normal
saline
and
rocuronium
0.6
mg
x
kg(-1
)
.

Morphine
0.1
mg
x
kg(-1

)
iv
was
given
for
premedication
and
all
patients
were
monitored
with
a
noninvasive
blood
pressure
monitor
,
ECG
and
pulse
oximetry
.

Anesthesia
was
induced
with
5
mg.kg(-1
)

thiopental
iv
.
followed
by
succinylcholine

(
Group
PS
,
LS
)
or
rocuronium
(
Group
PR
)
for
tracheal
intubation
.

Following
administration
of
these
agents
,
the
presence
,
and
degree
of
fasciculation
were
assessed
visually
on
a
four
point
scale
by
one
investigator
who
was
blinded
to
the
drug
administered
.

The
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
of
each
patient
were
monitored
on
nine
occasions
.

Twenty
-
four
hours
later
,
any
myalgia
experienced
was
assessed
according
to
a
structured
questionaire
and
graded
by
a
four
point
scale
by
one
investigator
blinded
to
the
intraoperative
management
.

The
results
indicate
that
muscle
fasciculation
was
not
found
in
Group
PR
while
the
patients
in
Group
LS
had
a
lower
incidence
of
muscle
fasciculation
than
those
in
Group
PS
(
p
0.001
)
.

At
24
h
,
the
incidence
of
myalgia
was
higher
in
Group
PS
than
in
Group
LS
and
PR
(
p
0.05
)
.

A
correlation
was
not
found
between
the
incidence
of
myalgia
and
the
occurrence
of
muscle
fasciculation
.

The
changes
in
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
were
not
significant
among
the
three
groups
.

In
conclusion
,
where
succinylcholine
is
used
,
lidocaine
is
proven
to
be
the
useful
pretreatment
agent
for
the
reduction
of
postoperative
myalgia
.

Open
-
label
assessment
of
levofloxacin
for
the
treatment
of
acute
bacterial
sinusitis
in
adults
.

PURPOSE
:
To
evaluate
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
levofloxacin

(
500
mg
orally
once
daily
for
10
to
14
days
)
in
treating
adult
outpatients
with
acute
bacterial
sinusitis
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

A
total
of
329
patients
enrolled
in
the
study
at
24
centers
.

All
patients
had
a
pre
-
therapy
Gram
's
stain
and
culture
of
sinus
exudate
obtained
by
antral
puncture
or
nasal
endoscopy
.

Clinical
response
was
assessed
on
the
basis
of
signs
and
symptoms
and
sinus
radiograph
or
computed
tomography
results
.

Microbiologic
cure
rates
were
determined
on
the
basis
of
presumed
plus
documented
eradication
of
the
pre
-
therapy
pathogen(s
)
.

RESULTS
:

The
most
common
pathogens
were
Haemophilus
influenzae
,
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
,
Staphylococcus
aureus
,
and
Moraxella
catarrhalis
.

Of
300
clinically
evaluable
patients
,
175
(
58
%
)
were
cured
and
90
(
30
%
)
were
improved
at
the
post
-
therapy
evaluation
,
resulting
in
a
clinical
success
rate
of
88
%
.

Thirty
-
five
patients
(
12
%
)
clinically
failed
treatment
.

The
microbiologic
eradication
rate
(
presumed
plus
documented
)
among
138
microbiologically
evaluable
patients
was
92
%
.

Microbiologic
eradication
rates
(
presumed
plus
documented
)
of
the
most
common
pathogens
ranged
from
93
%
(
M.
catarrhalis
)
to
100
%
(
S.
pneumoniae
)
at
the
post
-
therapy
visit
.

All
but
one
of
the
265
patients
who
were
cured
or
improved
at
post
-
therapy
returned
for
a
long
-
term
follow
-
up
visit
;
243
(
92
%
)
remained
well
4
to
6
weeks
after
therapy
;
and
21
(
8
%
)
had
a
relapse
of
symptoms
.

Adverse
events
considered
to
be
related
to
levofloxacin
administration
were
reported
by
29
patients
(
9
%
)
.

The
most
common
drug
-
related
adverse
events
were
diarrhea
,
flatulence
,
and
nausea
;
most
adverse
events
were
mild
to
moderate
in
severity
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
levofloxacin
500
mg
once
daily
is
an
effective
and
safe
treatment
for
acute
bacterial
sinusitis
.

Clinical
evaluation
on
combined
administration
of
oral
prostacyclin
analogue

beraprost
and
phosphodiesterase
inhibitor
cilostazol
.

Among
various
oral
antiplatelets
,
a
combination
of
a
novel
prostacyclin
analogue
beraprost

(
BPT
)
and
a
potent
phosphodiesterase
inhibitor
cilostazol

(
CLZ
)
may
result
in
untoward
clinical
effects
due
to
possible
synergistic
elevation
of
intracellular
cAMP

(
cyclic
adenosine
3',5'-monophosphate
)
.

Thereby
,
a
clinical
study
of
the
combined
administration
of
the
two
agents
was
attempted
.

Twelve
healthy
volunteers
were
assigned
to
take
BPT
/
CLZ
in
the
following
schedule
;
BPT
:
40
micrograms
at
day
1
and
120
micrograms
t.i.d
.

from
day
7
to
14
,
CLZ
:
200
mg
t.i.d
.

from
day
3
to
14
.

At
various
time
intervals
,
physical
examination
and
blood
collection
for
ex
vivo
platelet
aggregation
and
determination
of
intraplatelet
cAMP
were
performed
.

Throughout
the
observation
period
,
no
significant
alteration
in
vital
signs
was
observed
.

Seven
out
of
12
subjects
experienced
headache
of
a
short
duration
accompanying
facial
flush
in
one
and
nausea
in
one
,
especially
after
ingestion
of
CLZ
.

All
of
these
symptoms
,
probably
caused
by
the
vasodilating
effect
of
the
two
agents
,
were
of
mild
degree
and
no
special
treatment
was
required
.

Intraplatelet
cAMP
content
was
gradually
but
significantly
increased
to
9.84
+
/-

4.59
pmol
per
10(9
)
platelets
at
day
14
in
comparison
with
the
initial
value
(
6.87
+
/-

2.25
pmol
)
.

The
platelet
aggregability
was
significantly
suppressed
at
various
time
intervals
but
no
additive
or
synergistic
inhibitory
effect
by
the
combined
administration
was
noted
.

In
conclusion
,
the
combined
administration
of
BPT
/
CLZ
is
safe
at
doses
used
in
the
study
,
though
the
beneficial
clinical
effect
of
the
combined
administration
has
yet
to
be
elucidated
.

.

OBJECTIVE
:

A
randomised
,
double

study
to
compare
the
gastrointestinal
(
GI
)
tolerability
,
safety
and
efficacy
of
etoricoxib
and
diclofenac
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis

(
RA
)
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

A
total
of
4086
patients
(
mean
age
60.8
years
)
diagnosed
with
RA
were
enrolled
and
received
etoricoxib

90
mg
daily
(
n
=
2032
)
or
diclofenac
75
mg
twice
daily
(
n
=
2054
)
.

Use
of
gastroprotective
agents
and
low
-
dose

aspirin
was
allowed
.

The
prespecified
primary
end
point
consisted
of
the
cumulative
rate
of
patient
discontinuations
due
to
clinical
and
laboratory
GI
adverse
experiences
(
AEs
)
.

General
safety
was
also
assessed
,
including
adjudicated
thrombotic
cardiovascular
event
data
.

Efficacy
was
evaluated
using
the
Patient
Global
Assessment
of
Disease
Status
(
PGADS
;
0
-
4
point
scale
)
.

RESULTS
:

Mean
(
SD
;
maximum
)
duration
of
treatment
was
19.3
(
10.3
;
32.9
)
and
19.1
(
10.4
;
33.1
)
months
in
the
etoricoxib
and
diclofenac
groups
,
respectively
.

The
cumulative
discontinuation
rate
due
to
GI
AEs
was
significantly
lower
with
etoricoxib
than
diclofenac
(
5.2
vs
8.5
events
per
100
patient
-
years
,
respectively
;
hazard
ratio
0.62
(
95
%
CI
:
0.47
,
0.81
;
p
or=0.001
)
)
.

The
incidence
of
discontinuations
for
hypertension
-related
and
oedema
-related
AEs
were
significantly
higher
with
etoricoxib

(
2.5
%
and
1.1
%
respectively
)
compared
with
diclofenac
(
1.5
%
and
0.4
%
respectively
;
p<0.001
for
hypertension
and
p<0.01
for
oedema
)
.

Etoricoxib
and
diclofenac
treatment
resulted
in
similar
efficacy
(
PGADS
mean
changes
from
baseline
-0.62
vs
-0.58
,
respectively
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Etoricoxib

90
mg
demonstrated
a
significantly
lower
risk
for
discontinuing
treatment
due
to
GI
AEs
compared
with
diclofenac
150
mg
.

Discontinuations
from
renovascular
AEs
,
although
less
common
than
discontinuations
from
GI
AEs
,
were
significantly
higher
with
etoricoxib
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
evaluate
extrapyramidal
symptoms

(
EPS
)
,
including
akathisia
,
with
quetiapine
in
patients
with
bipolar
mania
.

METHODS
:

Data
were
analyzed
from
four
similarly
designed
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,

3-
to
12-week
studies
.

Two
studies
evaluated
quetiapine
monotherapy
(
up
to
800
mg
/
day
)

(
n
=
209
)
versus
placebo
(
n
=
198
)
,
with
lithium
or
haloperidol
monotherapy
as
respective
active
controls
.

Two
studies
evaluated

quetiapine
(
up
to
800
mg
/
day
)
in
combination
with
a
mood
stabilizer
(
lithium
or
divalproex
,
QTP
+
Li
/
DVP
)
(
n
=
196
)
compared
to
placebo
and
mood
stabilizer
(
PBO
+
Li
/
DVP
)

(
n
=
203
)
.

Extrapyramidal
symptoms
were
evaluated
using
the
Simpson
-
Angus
Scale
(
SAS
)
,
the
Barnes
Akathisia
Rating
Scale
(
BARS
)
,
adverse
event
reports
and
anticholinergic
drug
usage
.

RESULTS
:

The
incidence
of
EPS
-related
adverse
events
,
including
akathisia
,
was
no
different
with
quetiapine
monotherapy
(
12.9
%
)
than
with
placebo
(
13.1
%
)
.

Similarly
,
EPS
-related
adverse
events
with
QTP
+
Li
/
DVP

(
21.4
%
)
were
no
different
than
with
PBO
+
Li
/
DVP
(
19.2
%
)
.

Adverse
events
related
to
EPS
occurred
in
59.6
%
of
patients
treated
with
haloperidol

(
n
=
99
)
monotherapy
,
whereas
26.5
%
of
patients
treated
with
lithium

(
n
=
98
)
monotherapy
experienced
adverse
events
related
to
EPS
.

The
incidence
of
akathisia
was
low
and
similar
with
quetiapine
monotherapy
(
3.3
%
)
and
placebo
(
6.1
%
)
,
and
with
QTP
+
Li
/
DVP

(
3.6
%
)
and
PBO
+
Li
/
DVP
(
4.9
%
)
.

Lithium
was
associated
with
a
significantly
higher
incidence
(
p
0.05
)
of
tremor
(
18.4
%
)
than
quetiapine
(
5.6
%
)
;
cerebellar
tremor
,
which
is
a
known
adverse
effect
of
lithium
,
may
have
contributed
to
the
elevated
rate
of
tremor
in
patients
receiving
lithium
therapy
.

Haloperidol
induced
a
significantly
higher
incidence
(
p
0.001
)
of

akathisia
(
33.3
%
versus
5.9
%
)
,
tremor

(
30.3
%
versus
7.8
%
)
,
and
extrapyramidal
syndrome
(
35.4
%
versus
5.9
%
)
than
quetiapine
.

No
significant
differences
were
observed
between
quetiapine
and
placebo
on
SAS
and
BARS
scores
.

Anticholinergic
use
was
low
and
similar
with
quetiapine
or
placebo
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
bipolar
mania
,
the
incidence
of
EPS
,
including
akathisia
,
with
quetiapine
therapy
is
similar
to
that
with
placebo
.

Contribution
of
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
to
salt
-
sensitivity
in
lifetime
captopril
-treated
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
test
the
hypothesis
that
,
in
lifetime
captopril
-treated
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
(
SHR
)
,
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
contributes
importantly
to
the
hypertensive
effect
of
dietary
sodium
chloride
supplementation
.

METHODS
:
Male
SHR
(
aged
6
weeks
)
that
had
been
treated
from
conception
onward
with
either
captopril
or
vehicle
remained
on
a
basal
sodium
chloride
diet
or
were
fed
a
high
sodium
chloride
diet
.

After
2
weeks
,
the
rats
were
subjected
to
ganglionic
blockade
and
2
days
later
,
an
infusion
of
clonidine
.

RESULTS
:

Lifetime
captopril
treatment
significantly
lowered
mean
arterial
pressure
in
both
groups
.

Intravenous
infusion
of
the
ganglionic
blocker
hexamethonium
resulted
in
a
rapid
decline
in
MAP
that
eliminated
the
dietary
sodium
chloride
-induced
increase
in
MAP
in
both
groups
.

Infusion
of
the
central
nervous
system
alpha2-adrenergic
receptor
agonist

clonidine
also
resulted
in
a
greater
reduction
in
MAP
in
both
groups
of
SHR
that
were
fed
the
high
(
compared
with
the
basal
)

sodium
chloride
diet
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
both
lifetime
captopril
-treated
and
control
SHR
,
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
contributes
to
the
pressor
effects
of
a
high
sodium
chloride
diet
.

,
were
administered
to
adult
White
Leghorn
chickens
24
hr
after
they
were
placed
on
diets
containing
0
to
300
ppm
corticosterone
.

Supplemented
diets
were
continued
until
clinical
signs
and
lesions
of
delayed
neuropathy
appeared
.

Although
low
concentrations
(
less
than
or
equal
to
50
ppm
)
of
corticosterone
had
beneficial
effects
on
TOTP

-induced

neuropathy
,
greater
than
or
equal
to
200
ppm
exacerbated
clinical
signs
in
chickens
given
either
TOTP
or
DFP
.

Neurotoxic
esterase
activities
24
hr
after
TOTP
or
DFP
were
less
than
20
%
of
values
measured
in
chickens
not
given
organophosphorous
compounds
.

Chickens
given
200
ppm
corticosterone
without
TOTP
or
DFP
had
significantly
elevated
activity
of
plasma
cholinesterase
and
significantly
inhibited
activity
of
liver
carboxylesterase
.

Degenerating
myelinated
fibers
were
also
evident
in
distal
levels
of
the
peripheral
nerves
of
chickens
given
TOTP

treatment
of
chronic
hepatitis
C
patients
with
interferon
and
ribavirin
,
a
lot
of
side
effects
are
described
.

Twenty
-
three
percent
to
44
%
of
patients
develop
depression
.

A
minority
of
patients
evolve
to
psychosis
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
no
cases
of
psychogenic
parasitosis
occurring
during
interferon
therapy
have
been
described
in
the
literature
.

We
present
a
49-year
-
old
woman
who
developed
a
delusional
parasitosis
during
treatment
with
pegylated
interferon
alpha-2b

weekly
and
ribavirin
.

She
complained
of
seeing
parasites
and
the
larvae
of
fleas
in
her
stools
.

This
could
not
be
confirmed
by
any
technical
examination
.

All
the
complaints
disappeared
after
stopping
pegylated
interferon
alpha-2b
and
reappeared
after
restarting
it
.

She
had
a
complete
sustained
viral
response
.

Possible
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
related
to
concomitant
treatment
with
paroxetine
and
alprazolam
.

A
74-year
-
old
man
with
depressive
symptoms
was
admitted
to
a
psychiatric
hospital
due
to
insomnia
,
loss
of
appetite
,
exhaustion
,
and
agitation
.

Medical
treatment
was
initiated
at
a
daily
dose
of
20
mg
paroxetine
and
1.2
mg
alprazolam
.

On
the
10th
day
of
paroxetine
and
alprazolam
treatment
,
the
patient
exhibited
marked
psychomotor
retardation
,
disorientation
,
and
severe
muscle
rigidity
with
tremors
.

The
patient
had
a
fever
(
38.2
degrees
C
)
,
fluctuating
blood
pressure
(
between
165/90
and
130/70
mg
mm
Hg
)
,
and
severe
extrapyramidal
symptoms
.

Laboratory
tests
showed
an
elevation
of
creatine
phosphokinase

(
2218
IU
/
L
)
,
aspartate
aminotransferase
(
134
IU
/
L
)
,
alanine
aminotransferase
(
78
IU
/
L
)
,
and
BUN
(
27.9
mg
/
ml
)
levels
.

The
patient
received
bromocriptine
and
diazepam
to
treat
his
symptoms
.

7
days
later
,
the
fever
disappeared
and
the
patient
's
serum

CPK
levels
were
normalized
(
175
IU
/
L
)
.

This
patient
presented
with
symptoms
of
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome

(
NMS
)
,
thus
demonstrating
that
NMS
-like
symptoms
can
occur
after
combined
paroxetine
and
alprazolam
treatment
.

The
adverse
drug
reaction
score
obtained
by
the
Naranjo
algorithm
was
6
in
our
case
,
indicating
a
probable
relationship
between
the
patient
's
NMS
-like
adverse
symptoms
and
the
combined
treatment
used
in
this
case
.

The
involvement
of
physiologic
and
environmental
aspects
specific
to
this
patient
was
suspected
.

Several
risk
factors
for
NMS
should
be
noted
in
elderly
depressive
patients
whose
symptoms
often
include
dehydration
,
agitation
,
malnutrition
,
and
exhaustion
.

Careful
therapeutic
intervention
is
necessary
in
cases
involving
elderly
patients
who
suffer
from
depression
.

Pilocarpine
seizures
cause
age
-
dependent
impairment
in
auditory
location
discrimination
.

Children
who
have
status
epilepticus
have
continuous
or
rapidly
repeating
seizures
that
may
be
life
-
threatening
and
may
cause
life
-
long
changes
in
brain
and
behavior
.

The
extent
to
which
status
epilepticus
causes
deficits
in
auditory
discrimination
is
unknown
.

A
naturalistic
auditory
location
discrimination
method
was
used
to
evaluate
this
question
using
an
animal
model
of
status
epilepticus
.

Male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
injected
with
saline
on
postnatal
day
(
P
)
20
,
or
a
convulsant
dose
of

pilocarpine
on
P20
or
P45
.

Pilocarpine
on
either
day
induced
status
epilepticus
;
status
epilepticus
at
P45
resulted
in
CA3
cell
loss
and
spontaneous
seizures
,
whereas
P20
rats
had
no
cell
loss
or
spontaneous
seizures
.

Mature
rats
were
trained
with
sound
-
source
location
and
sound
-
silence
discriminations
.

Control
(
saline
P20
)
rats
acquired
both
discriminations
immediately
.

In
status
epilepticus
(
P20
)
rats
,
acquisition
of
the
sound
-
source
location
discrimination
was
moderately
impaired
.

Status
epilepticus
(
P45
)
rats
failed
to
acquire
either
sound
-
source
location
or
sound
-
silence
discriminations
.

Status
epilepticus
in
rat
causes
an
age
-
dependent
,
long
-
term
impairment
in
auditory
discrimination
.

This
impairment
may
explain
one
cause
of
impaired
auditory
location
discrimination
in
humans
.

Cardiovascular
risk
with
cyclooxygenase
inhibitors
:
general
problem
with
substance
specific
differences
?

Randomised
clinical
trials
and
observational
studies
have
shown
an
increased
risk
of
myocardial
infarction
,
stroke
,

hypertension
and
heart
failure
during
treatment
with
cyclooxygenase
inhibitors
.

Adverse
cardiovascular
effects
occurred
mainly
,
but
not
exclusively
,
in
patients
with
concomitant
risk
factors
.

Cyclooxygenase
inhibitors
cause
complex
changes
in
renal
,
vascular
and
cardiac
prostanoid
profiles
thereby
increasing
vascular
resistance
and
fluid
retention
.

The
incidence
of
cardiovascular
adverse
events
tends
to
increase
with
the
daily
dose
and
total
exposure
time
.

A
comparison
of
individual
selective
and
unselective
cyclooxygenase
inhibitors
suggests
substance
-
specific
differences
,
which
may
depend
on
differences
in
pharmacokinetic
parameters
or
inhibitory
potency
and
may
be
contributed
by
prostaglandin
-independent
effects
.

Diagnostic
markers
such
as
N
-
terminal
pro
brain
natriuretic
peptide

(
NT
-
proBNP
)
or
high
-
sensitive
C
-
reactive
protein
might
help
in
the
early
identification
of
patients
at
risk
,
thus
avoiding
the
occurrence
of
serious
cardiovascular
toxicity
.

Predictors
of
decreased
renal
function
in
patients
with
heart
failure
during
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
therapy
:
results
from
the
studies
of
left
ventricular
dysfunction

(
SOLVD
)

BACKGROUND
:

Although
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
therapy
reduces
mortality
rates
in
patients
with
congestive
heart
failure

(
CHF
)
,
it
may
also
cause
decreased
renal
function
.

Little
information
is
available
to
predict
which
patients
are
at
highest
risk
for
this
complication
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
quantify
specific
clinical
predictors
of
reduction
in
renal
function
in
patients
with
CHF
who
are
prescribed
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
therapy
.

METHOD
:

We
analyzed
data
from
the
Studies
of
Left
Ventricular
Dysfunction

(
SOLVD
)
,
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
of
enalapril
for
the
treatment
of
CHF
.

There
were
3379
patients
randomly
assigned
to
enalapril
with
a
median
follow
-
up
of
974
days
and
3379
patients
randomly
assigned
to
placebo
with
a
mean
follow
-
up
of
967
days
.

Decreased
renal
function
was
defined
as
a
rise
in
serum
creatinine

>
/=0.5
mg
/
dL
(
44
micromol
/
L
)
from
baseline
.

We
used
time
-
to
-
event
analysis
to
identify
potential
predictors
of
decrease
in
renal
function
including
age
,
baseline
ejection
fraction
,
baseline
creatinine
,
low
systolic
blood
pressure
(
100
mm
Hg
)
,
history
of
hypertension
,
diabetes
,
and
use
of
antiplatelet
,
diuretic
,
and
beta
-
blocker
therapy
.

RESULTS
:

Patients
randomly
assigned
to
enalapril
had
a
33
%
greater
likelihood
of
decreased
renal
function
than
controls
(
P
=
.003
)
.

By
multivariate
analysis
,
in
both
the
placebo
and
enalapril
groups
older
age
,
diuretic
therapy
,
and
diabetes
were
associated
with
decreased
renal
function
,
whereas
beta
-
blocker
therapy
and
higher
ejection
fraction
were
renoprotective
.

Older
age
was
associated
with
a
greater
risk
of
developing
decreased
renal
function
in
both
groups
,
but
significantly
more
so
in
the
enalapril
group
(
enalapril

)
.

Diuretic
therapy
was
likewise
associated
with
a
greater
risk
of
decreased
renal
function
in
the
enalapril
group
(
RR
1.89
,
95

)
than
in
the
placebo
group
(
RR
1.35
,
95
%
CI
1.09
-
1.66
)
.

Conversely
,
enalapril
had
a
relative
renoprotective
effect
(
RR
1.33
,
95
%
CI
1.13
-
1.53
)
compared
with
placebo
(
RR
1.96
,
95
%
CI
1.57
-
2.44
)
in
patients
with
diabetes
.

A
lower
risk
of
renal
impairment
was
seen
in
both
groups
with
beta
-
blocker
therapy
(
RR
0.70
,
95
%
CI
0.57
-
0.85
)
and
higher
baseline
ejection

(
RR
0.93
per
5
%
increment
,
95
%
CI
0.91
-

)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Enalapril
use
caused
a
33
%
increase
in
the
risk
of
decreased
renal
function
in
patients
with
CHF
.

Diuretic
use
and
advanced
age
increased
this
risk
.

Diabetes
was
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
renal
impairment
in
all
patients
with
CHF
,
but
this
risk
was
reduced
in
the
enalapril
group
compared
with
the
placebo
group
.

beta

Pemoline
induced
acute
choreoathetosis
:
case
report
and
review
of
the
literature
.

BACKGROUND
:

Pemoline
is
an
oxazolidine
derivative
that
is
structurally
different
from
amphetamines
and
used
in
the
treatment
of
attention
deficit
disorder
.

Pemoline
has
not
been
commonly
associated
in
the
literature
as
a
cause
of
acute
movement
disorders
.

The
following
case
describes
two
children
acutely
poisoned
with
pemoline
who
experienced
profound
choreoathetosis
.

CASE
REPORT
:

Two
,
3-year
-
old
male
,
identical
twin
siblings
presented
to
the
emergency
department
after
found
playing
with
a
an
empty
bottle
of
pemoline
originally
containing
59
tablets
.

The
children
had
a
medical
history
significant
for
attention
deficit
disorder
previously
treated
with
methylphenidate
without
success
.

This
was
their
first
day
of
pemoline
therapy
.

The
choreoathetoid
movements
began
45
min
to
1
h
after
ingestion
.

The
children
gave
no
history
of
prior
movement
disorders

and
there
was
no
family
history
of
movement
disorders
.

The
children
received
gastrointestinal
decontamination
and
high
doses
of
intravenous
benzodiazepines
in
an
attempt
to
control
the
choreoathetoid
movements
.

Despite
treatment
,
the
children
continued
to
have
choreoathetosis
for
approximately
24
hours
.

Forty
-
eight
hours
after
admission
,
the
children
appeared
to
be
at
their
baseline
and
were
discharged
home
.

CONCLUSION
:

Pemoline
associated

movement
disorder
has
been
rarely
reported
in
the
acute
toxicology
literature
.

The
possibility
of
choreoathetoid
movements
should
be
considered
in
patients
presenting
after
pemoline
overdose
.

Continuous
subcutaneous
administration
of
mesna
to
prevent
ifosfamide
-induced
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

Hemorrhagic
cystitis
is
a
major
potential

toxicity
of
ifosfamide
that
can
be
prevented
by
administering
mesna
along
with
the
cytotoxic
agent
.

Mesna
is
generally
administered
by
the
intravenous
route
,
although
experience
with
oral
delivery
of
the
drug
has
increased
.

The
continuous
subcutaneous
administration
of
mesna
has
the
advantage
of
not
requiring
intravenous
access
.

In
addition
,
subcutaneous
delivery
of
the
neutralizing
agent
will
not
be
associated
with
the
risk
of
inadequate
urinary
mesna
concentrations
,
such
as
in
a
patient
taking
oral
mesna
who
experiences
severe
ifosfamide
-induced
emesis
and
is
unable
to
absorb
the
drug
.

Limited
clinical
experience
with
continuous
subcutaneous
mesna
administration
suggests
it
is
a
safe
,
practical
,
and
economic
method
of
drug
delivery
that
permits
ifosfamide
to
be
administered
successfully
in
the
outpatient
setting
.

Modification
of
drug
action
by
hyperammonemia
.

Pretreatment
with
ammonium
acetate

(
NH4Ac
)
(
6
mmol
/
kg
s.c
.
)
approximately
doubled
the
time

morphine

-treated
mice
remained
on
a
hot
surface
and
similarly
increased
muscular
incoordination
by
diazepam
,
but
NH4Ac
treatment
alone
had
no
effect
.

Thus
,
hyperammonemia
is
capable
of
altering
drug
action
and
must
be
considered
along
with
impaired
drug
metabolism
in
enhanced
drug
responses
associated
with
liver
disease
.

Experiments
in
vitro
showed
that
acetylcholine
-induced
catecholamine
release
from
bovine
adrenal
medulla
is
depressed
as
much
as
50
%
by
0.3
mM
NH4Ac
and
KCl
-induced
contractions
of
guinea
-
pig
ileum
were
inhibited
20
%
by
5
mM
NH4Ac
.

Addition
of
excess
calcium
reversed
the
depression
in
both
tissues
,
but
calcium
-independent

catecholamine
release
by
acetaldehyde
was
not
blocked
by
NH4Ac
.

These
results
suggested
that
ammonia
blocks
calcium
channels
.

Parallels
in
the
actions
of
NH4Ac
and
the
calcium
channel
blocker
verapamil
support
this
concept
.

Both
verapamil

(
10
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
and
NH4Ac
pretreatment
enhanced
morphine
analgesia
-
and
diazepam
-induced
muscular
incoordination
and
antagonized
amphetamine
-induced
motor
activity
,
and
neither
verapamil
nor
NH4Ac
affected
the
convulsant
action
of
metrazol
.

The
data
suggest
that
hyperammonemia
exerts
a
calcium
channel
blocking
action
which
enhances
the
effects
of
central
nervous
system
depressants
and
certain
opioid
analgesics
.

Risk
of
nephropathy
after
consumption
of
nonionic
contrast
media
by
children
undergoing
cardiac
angiography
:
a
prospective
study
.

Despite
increasing
reports
on
nonionic
contrast
media

-induced

nephropathy

(
CIN
)
in
hospitalized
adult
patients
during
cardiac
procedures
,
the
studies
in
pediatrics
are
limited
,
with
even
less
focus
on
possible
predisposing
factors
and
preventive
measures
for
patients
undergoing
cardiac
angiography
.

This
prospective
study
determined
the
incidence
of
CIN
for
two
nonionic
contrast
media

(
CM
)
,

iopromide
and
iohexol
,
among
80
patients
younger
than
18
years
and
compared
the
rates
for
this
complication
in
relation
to
the
type
and
dosage
of
CM
and
the
presence
of
cyanosis
.

The
80
patients
in
the
study
consecutively
received
either
iopromide

(
group
A
,
n
=
40
)
or
iohexol
(
group
B
,
n
=
40
)
.

Serum
sodium

(
Na
)
,
potassium

(
K
)
,
and
creatinine

(
Cr
)
were
measured
24
h
before
angiography
as
baseline
values
,
then
measured
again
at
12-
,
24-
,
and
48-h
intervals
after
CM
use
.

Urine
samples
for
Na
and
Cr
also
were
checked
at
the
same
intervals
.

Risk
of
renal
failure
,
Injury
to
the
kidney
,
Failure
of
kidney
function
,
Loss
of
kidney
function
,
and
End
-
stage

renal
damage
(
RIFLE
criteria
)
were
used
to
define
CIN
and
its
incidence
in
the
study
population
.

Accordingly
,
among
the
15
CIN
patients
(
18.75
%
)
,
7.5
%
of
the
patients
in
group
A
had
increased
risk
and
3.75
%
had
renal
injury
,
whereas
5
%
of
group
B
had
increased
risk
and
2.5
%
had

renal
injury
.

Whereas
33.3
%
of
the
patients
with
CIN
were
among
those
who
received
the
proper
dosage
of
CM
,
the
percentage
increased
to
66.6
%
among
those
who
received
larger
doses
,
with
a
significant
difference
in
the
incidence
of
CIN
related
to
the
different
dosages
of
CM

(
p
=
0.014
)
.

Among
the
15
patients
with
CIN
,
6
had
cyanotic
congenital
heart
diseases
,
but
the
incidence
did
not
differ
significantly
from
that
for
the
noncyanotic
patients
(
p
=
0.243
)
.

Although
clinically
silent
,
CIN
is
not
rare
in
pediatrics
.

The
incidence
depends
on
dosage
but
not
on
the
type
of
consumed
nonionic
CM
,
nor
on
the
presence
of
cyanosis
,
and
although
CIN
usually
is
reversible
,
more
concern
is
needed
for
the
prevention
of
such
a
complication
in
children
.

and
quality
in
such
patients
and
is
generally
well
tolerated
aside
from
occasional
reports
of
relatively
benign
ventricular
ectopy
.

We
describe
a
patient
with
no
previous
history
of
cardiac
disease
or
arrhythmia
who
developed
sustained
bigeminy
and
2
brief
runs
of
ventricular
tachycardia
after
caffeine
administration
.

Although
intravenous
caffeine
is
generally
well
tolerated
,
the
clinician
should
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
unpredictable
and
serious
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

Optical
coherence
tomography
can
measure
axonal
loss
in
patients
with
ethambutol

-induced

optic
neuropathy
.

PURPOSE
:

To
map
and
identify
the
pattern
,
in
vivo
,
of
axonal
degeneration
in
ethambutol
-induced
optic
neuropathy
using
optical
coherence
tomography
(
OCT
)
.

Ethambutol
is
an
antimycobacterial
agent
often
used
to
treat
tuberculosis
.

A
serious
complication
of
ethambutol
is
an
optic
neuropathy

that
impairs
visual
acuity
,
contrast
sensitivity
,
and
color
vision
.

However
,
early
on
,
when
the
toxic
optic
neuropathy
is
mild
and
partly
reversible
,
the
funduscopic
findings
are
often
subtle
and
easy
to
miss
.

METHODS
:

Three
subjects
with
a
history
of
ethambutol

(
EMB
)
-induced

optic
neuropathy
of
short-
,
intermediate-
,
and
long
-
term

visual
deficits
were
administered
a
full
neuro
-
ophthalmologic
examination
including
visual
acuity
,
color
vision
,
contrast
sensitivity
,
and
fundus
examination
.

In
addition
,
OCT
(
OCT
3000
,
Humphrey
-
Zeiss
,
Dublin
,
CA
)
was
performed
on
both
eyes
of
each
subject
using
the
retinal
nerve
fiber
layer
(
RNFL
)
analysis
protocol
.

OCT
interpolates
data
from
100
points
around
the
optic
nerve
to
effectively
map
out
the
RNFL
.

RESULTS
:

The
results
were
compared
to
the
calculated
average
RNFL
of
normal
eyes
accumulated
from
four
prior
studies
using
OCT
,
n=661
.

In
all
subjects
with
history
of
EMB

-induced

optic
neuropathy
,
there
was
a
mean
loss
of
72
%
nerve
fiber
layer
thickness
in
the
temporal
quadrant
(
patient
A
,
with
eventual
recovery
of
visual
acuity
and
fields
,
58
%
loss
;
patient
B
,
with
intermediate
visual
deficits
,
68
%
loss
;
patient
C
,
with
chronic
visual
deficits
,
90
%
loss
)
,
with
an
average
mean
optic
nerve
thickness
of
26+/-16
microm
.

There
was
a
combined
mean
loss
of
46
%
of
fibers
from
the
superior
,
inferior
,
and
nasal
quadrants
in
the
(
six
)
eyes
of
all
three
subjects
(
mean
average
thickness
of
55+/-29
microm
)
.

In
both
sets
(
four
)
of
eyes
of
the
subjects
with
persistent
visual
deficits

(
patients
B
and
C
)
,
there
was
an
average
loss
of
79
%
of
nerve
fiber
thickness
in
the
temporal
quadrant
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
OCT
results
in
these
patients
with

EMB
-induced

optic
neuropathy
show
considerable
loss
especially
of
the
temporal
fibers
.

This
is
consistent
with
prior
histopathological
studies
that
show
predominant
loss
of
parvo
-
cellular
axons
(
or
small
-
caliber
axons
)
within
the
papillo
-
macular
bundle
in
toxic
or
hereditary
optic
neuropathies
.

OCT
can
be
a
valuable
tool
in
the
quantitative
analysis
of
optic
neuropathies
.

Additionally
,
in
terms
of
management
of
EMB

-induced

optic
neuropathy
,
it
is
important
to
properly
manage
ethambutol
dosing
in
patients
with
renal
impairment
and
to
achieve
proper
transition
to
a
maintenance
dose
once
an
appropriate
loading
dose
has
been
reached
.

Effects
of
the
cyclooxygenase-2
specific
inhibitor
valdecoxib
versus
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
agents
and
placebo
on
cardiovascular
thrombotic
events
in
patients
with
arthritis
.

There
have
been
concerns
that
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
thrombotic
events
may
be
higher
with
cyclooxygenase
(
COX)-2-specific
inhibitors
than
nonselective
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
.

We
evaluated
cardiovascular
event
data
for
valdecoxib
,
a
new
COX-2-specific
inhibitor
in
approximately
8000
patients
with
osteoarthritis
and
rheumatoid
arthritis
treated
with
this
agent
in
randomized
clinical
trials
.

The
incidence
of
cardiovascular
thrombotic
events
(
cardiac
,
cerebrovascular
and
peripheral
vascular
,
or
arterial
thrombotic
)
was
determined
by
analyzing
pooled
valdecoxib

(
10
-
80
mg
daily
)
,

nonselective
NSAID
(
diclofenac
75
mg
bid
,
ibuprofen
800
mg
tid
,
or
naproxen
500
mg
bid
)
and
placebo
data
from
10
randomized
osteoarthritis
and
rheumatoid
arthritis
trials
that
were
6
-
52
weeks
in
duration
.

The
incidence
rates
of
events
were
determined
in
all
patients
(
n
=
7934
)
and
in
users
of
low
-
dose
(
or
=
325
mg
daily
)

aspirin
(
n
=
1051
)
and
nonusers
of
aspirin

(
n
=
6883
)
.

Crude
and
exposure
-
adjusted
incidences
of
thrombotic
events
were
similar
for
valdecoxib
,
NSAIDs
,
and
placebo
.

The
risk
of
serious
thrombotic
events
was
also
similar
for
each
valdecoxib
dose
.

Thrombotic
risk
was
consistently
higher
for
users
of
aspirin
users
than
nonusers
of
aspirin

(
placebo
,
1.4
%
vs.
0
%
;
valdecoxib
,
1.7
%
vs.
0.2
%
;
NSAIDs
,
1.9
%
vs.
0.5
%
)
.

The
rates
of
events
in
users
of
aspirin
were
similar
for
all
3
treatment
groups
and
across
valdecoxib
doses
.

Short-
and
intermediate
-
term
treatment
with
therapeutic
(
10
or
20
mg
daily
)
and
supratherapeutic
(
40
or
80
mg
daily
)

valdecoxib
doses
was
not
associated
with
an
increased
incidence
of
thrombotic
events
relative
to
nonselective
NSAIDs
or
placebo
in
osteoarthritis
and
rheumatoid
arthritis
patients
in
controlled
clinical
trials
.

A
randomized
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
crossover
study
of
ephedrine
for
SSRI
-
induced
female
sexual
dysfunction
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
ephedrine
,
an
alpha-
and
beta
-
adrenergic
agonist
previously
shown
to
enhance
genital
blood
flow
in
women
,
has
beneficial
effects
in
reversing
antidepressant
-
induced
sexual
dysfunction
.

Nineteen
sexually
dysfunctional

women
receiving
either
fluoxetine
,
sertraline
,
or
paroxetine
participated
in
an
eight
-
week
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
cross
-
over
study
of
the
effects
of
ephedrine

(
50
mg
)
on
self
-
report
measures
of
sexual
desire
,
arousal
,
orgasm
,
and
sexual
satisfaction
.

Although
there
were
significant
improvements
relative
to
baseline
in
sexual
desire
and
orgasm
intensity
/
pleasure
on
50
mg

ephedrine
1-hr
prior
to
sexual
activity
,
significant
improvements
in
these
measures
,
as
well
as
in
sexual
arousal
and
orgasmic
ability
also
were
noted
with
placebo
.

These
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
conducting
placebo
-
controlled
trials
for
this
condition
.

Erectile
dysfunction
occurs
following
substantia
nigra
lesions
in
the
rat
.

Erectile
function
was
assessed
6
weeks
following
uni-
and
bilateral
injections
of
6-hydroxydopamine
in
the
substantia
nigra
nucleus
of
the
brain
.

Behavioral
apomorphine

-induced
penile
erections
were
reduced
(
5/8
)
and
increased
(
3/8
)
in
uni-
and
bilateral
lesioned
animals
.

Intracavernous
pressures
,
following
electrical
stimulation
of
the
cavernous
nerve
,
decreased
in
lesioned
animals
.

Lesions
of
the
substantia
nigra
were
confirmed
by
histology
.

Concentration
of
dopamine
and
its
metabolites
were
decreased
in
the
striatum
of
substantia
nigra
lesioned
rats
.

Lesions
of
the
substantia
nigra
are
therefore
associated
with
erectile
dysfunction
in
rats
and
may
serve
as
a
model
to
study
erectile
dysfunction
in
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Potential
therapeutic
use
of
the
selective
dopamine
D1
receptor
agonist
,
A-86929
:
an
acute
study
in
parkinsonian
levodopa

-primed
monkeys
.

The
clinical
utility
of
dopamine

(
DA
)
D1
receptor
agonists
in
the
treatment
of
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
is
still
unclear
.

The
therapeutic
use
of
selective
DA
D1
receptor
agonists
such
as
SKF-82958

(
6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaze
pine
hydrobromide
)
and
A-77636

(
[
1R
,
3S
]
3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzo
pyran
hydrochloride
)
seems
limited
because
of
their
duration
of
action
,
which
is
too
short
for
SKF-82958

(
1
hr
)
and
too
long
for
A-77636

(
>
20
hr
,
leading
to
behavioral
tolerance
)
.

We
therefore
conducted
the
present
acute
dose
-
response
study
in
four
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine

(
MPTP
)
-exposed

cynomolgus
monkeys
primed
to
exhibit

levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias
to
evaluate
the
locomotor
and
dyskinetic
effects
on
challenge
with
four
doses
(
from
0.03
to
1.0
mg
/
kg
)
of
A-86929

(
[
-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b
-
hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+

+
azacyclopent-1-
ena[c]phenathrene-9
-
10-diol
)
,
a
selective
and
full
DA
D1-like
receptor
agonist
with
an
intermediate
duration
of
action
.

Levodopa
and
the

DA
D2-like
receptor
agonist
,
LY-171555

(
[
4aR
-
trans]-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-o
-
dihydro-5n
-
propyl-2H
-
pyrazo
lo-3
-
4-quinoline
hydrochloride
)
were
also
used
for
comparison
.

Acute
administration
of
A-86929
was
as
efficacious
in
alleviating
MPTP
-induced

parkinsonism
as
levodopa
and
LY-171555
,
but
was
less
likely
to
reproduce
the
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
in
these
animals
than
with
either
LY-171555
or
subsequent
challenge
of
levodopa
.

Selective
stimulation
of
the
DA
D1
receptor
may
provide
better
integration
of
neural
inputs
transmitted
to
the
internal
segment
of
the
globus
pallidus
(
referred
to
as
the
basal
ganglia
output
)
compared
with
levodopa
and
selective
DA
D2
receptor
agonist
.

Potent
DA

D1
receptor
agents
with
an
intermediate
duration
of
efficacy
such
as
A-86929

(
approximately
4
hr
at
higher
doses
tested
)
are
potential
therapeutic
tools
in
PD
and
merit
further
attention
.

Deaths
from
local
anesthetic
-
induced
convulsions
in
mice
.

Median
convulsant
(
CD50
)
and
median
lethal

(
LD50
)
doses
of
three
representative
local
anesthetics
were
determined
in
adult
mice
to
evaluate
the
threat
to
life
of
local
anesthetic
-
induced
convulsions
.

The
CD50
and
LD50
,
respectively
,
were
57.7
and
58.7
mg
/
kg
for

bupivacaine
,
111.0
and
133.1
mg
/
kg
for
lidocaine
,
and
243.4
and
266.5
mg
/
kg
for

chloroprocaine
.

When
given
intraperitoneally
,
bupivacaine
thus
was
only
about
twice
as
toxic
as
lidocaine
and
four
times
as
toxic
as
chloroprocaine
.

Convulsions
always
preceded
death
,
except
after
precipitous
cardiopulmonary
arrest
from
extreme
doses
.

A
CD50
dose
of
local
anesthetic
(
causing
convulsions
in
50
%
of
mice
)
was
fatal
in
90
%
of
bupivacaine

-induced

seizures
,
in
57
%
of
the
chloroprocaine
group
,
and
in
6
%
of
the
lidocaine
group
.

The
narrow
gap
between
convulsant
and
lethal
doses
of
local
anesthetics
indicates
that
untreated
convulsions
present

much
more
of
a
threat
to
life
than
heretofore
appreciated
.

Myoclonic
,
atonic
,
and
absence
seizures
following
institution
of
carbamazepine
therapy
in
children
.

Five
children
,
aged
3
to
11
years
,
treated
with
carbamazepine
for
epilepsy
,
had
an
acute
aberrant
reaction
characterized
by
the
onset
of
myoclonic
,
atypical
absence
and/or
atonic
(
minor
motor
)
seizures
within
a
few
days
.

When
the
carbamazepine
was
discontinued
,
two
of
the
children
returned
to
their
former
state
very
quickly
,
two
had
the
minor
motor
seizures
resolve
in
3
and
6
months
,
and
one
had
the
seizures
persist
.

The
child
in
whom
the
seizures
persisted
was
later
found
to
have
ceroid
lipofuscinosis
.

The
other
children
are
doing
well
on
other
anticonvulsants
.

Naloxone
reversal
of
hypotension
due
to
captopril
overdose
.

The
hemodynamic
effects
of
captopril
and
other
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
may
be
mediated
by
the
endogenous
opioid
system
.

The
opioid
antagonist
naloxone
has
been
shown
to
block
or
reverse
the
hypotensive
actions
of
captopril
.

We
report
a
case
of
an
intentional
captopril
overdose
,
manifested
by
marked
hypotension
,
that
resolved
promptly
with
the
administration
of
naloxone
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
reported
case
of
captopril
-induced

hypotension
treated
with
naloxone
.

Our
experience
demonstrates
a
possible
role
of
naloxone
in
the
reversal
of
hypotension
resulting
from
captopril
.

Carbamazepine
-induced
cardiac
dysfunction
.

Characterization
of
two
distinct
clinical
syndromes
.

A
patient
with
sinus
bradycardia
and
atrioventricular
block
,
induced
by
carbamazepine
,
prompted
an
extensive
literature
review
of
all
previously
reported
cases
.

From
the
analysis
of
these
cases
,
two
distinct
forms
of
carbamazepine
-associated
cardiac
dysfunction
emerged
.

One
patient
group
developed
sinus
tachycardias
in
the
setting
of
a
massive
carbamazepine
overdose
.

The
second
group
consisted
almost
exclusively
of
elderly
women
who
developed
potentially
life
-
threatening
bradyarrhythmias
or
atrioventricular
conduction
delay
,
associated
with
either
therapeutic
or
modestly
elevated
carbamazepine
serum
levels
.

Because
carbamazepine
is
widely
used
in
the
treatment
of
many
neurologic
and
psychiatric
conditions
,
the
recognition
of
the
latter
syndrome
has
important
implications
for
the
use
of
this
drug
in
elderly
patients
.

Glutamatergic
neurotransmission
mediated
by
NMDA
receptors
in
the
inferior
colliculus
can
modulate
haloperidol

-induced

catalepsy
.

The
inferior
colliculus
(
IC
)
is
primarily
involved
in
the
processing
of
auditory
information
,
but
it
is
distinguished
from
other
auditory
nuclei
in
the
brainstem
by
its
connections
with
structures
of
the
motor
system
.

Functional
evidence
relating
the
IC
to
motor
behavior
derives
from
experiments
showing
that
activation
of
the
IC
by
electrical
stimulation
or
excitatory
amino
acid
microinjection
causes
freezing
,
escape
-
like
behavior
,
and
immobility
.

However
,
the
nature
of
this
immobility
is
still
unclear
.

The
present
study
examined
the
influence
of
excitatory
amino
acid
-mediated
mechanisms
in
the
IC
on
the
catalepsy
induced
by
the
dopamine
receptor
blocker
haloperidol
administered
systemically
(
1
or
0.5
mg
/
kg
)
in
rats
.

Haloperidol
-induced

catalepsy
was
challenged
with
prior
intracollicular
microinjections
of
glutamate
NMDA
receptor
antagonists
,
MK-801
(
15
or
30
mmol/0.5
microl
)
and
AP7
(
10
or
20
nmol/0.5
microl
)
,
or
of
the
NMDA
receptor
agonist
N
-
methyl
-
d
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
,
20
or
30
nmol/0.5
microl
)
.

The
results
showed
that
intracollicular
microinjection
of
MK-801
and
AP7
previous
to
systemic
injections
of
haloperidol
significantly
attenuated
the
catalepsy
,
as
indicated
by
a
reduced
latency
to
step
down
from
a
horizontal
bar
.

Accordingly
,
intracollicular
microinjection
of
NMDA
increased
the
latency
to
step
down
the
bar
.

These
findings
suggest
that
glutamate
-mediated
mechanisms
in
the
neural
circuits
at
the
IC
level
influence

haloperidol
-induced

catalepsy
and
participate
in
the
regulation
of
motor
activity
.

Metabotropic
glutamate
7
receptor
subtype
modulates
motor
symptoms
in
rodent
models
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Metabotropic
glutamate

(
mGlu
)
receptors
modulate
synaptic
transmission
in
the
central
nervous
system
and
represent
promising
therapeutic
targets
for
symptomatic
treatment
of
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
.

Among
the
eight
mGlu
receptor
subtypes
,
mGlu7
receptor
is
prominently
expressed
in
the
basal
ganglia
,
but
its
role
in
restoring

.

The
effects
of
N
,
N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine
dihydrochloride

(
AMN082
)
,
the
first
selective
allosteric
activator
of
mGlu7
receptors
,
were
thus
tested
in
different
rodent
models
of
PD
.

Here
,
we
show
that
oral
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
or
intrastriatal
administration
(
0.1
and
0.5
nmol
)
of
AMN082
reverses

haloperidol
-induced

catalepsy
in
rats
.

AMN082
(
2.5
and
5
mg
/
kg
)
reduces
apomorphine
-induced
rotations
in
unilateral
6-hydroxydopamine

(
6-OHDA
)
-lesioned
rats
.

In
a
more
complex
task
commonly
used
to
evaluate
major
akinetic
symptoms
of
PD
patients
,
5
mg
/
kg
AMN082
reverses
the
increased
reaction
time
to
respond
to
a
cue
of
bilateral
6-OHDA
-lesioned
rats
.

In
addition
,
AMN082
reduces
the
duration
of
haloperidol
-induced

catalepsy
in
a
mGlu7
receptor
-
dependent
manner
in
wild
-
type
but
not
mGlu7
receptor
knockout
mice
.

Higher
doses
of
AMN082

(
10
and
20
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
)

have
no
effect
on
the
same
models
of
PD
.

Overall
these
findings
suggest
that
mGlu7
receptor
activation
can
reverse
motor
dysfunction
associated
with
reduced
dopamine
activity
.

Selective
ligands
of
mGlu7
receptor
subtypes
may
thus
be
considered
as
promising
compounds
for
the
development
of
antiparkinsonian
therapeutic
strategies
.

Nimodipine
prevents
memory
impairment
caused
by

nitroglycerin
-induced

hypotension
in
adult
mice
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hypotension
and
a
resultant
decrease
in
cerebral
blood
flow
have
been
implicated
in
the
development
of
cognitive
dysfunction
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
nimodipine

(
NIMO
)
administered
at
the
onset
of
nitroglycerin

(
NTG
)
-induced

hypotension
would
preserve
long
-
term
associative
memory
.

METHODS
:

The
passive
avoidance
(
PA
)
paradigm
was
used
to
assess
memory
retention
.

For
PA
training
,
latencies
(
seconds
)
were
recorded
for
entry
from
a
suspended
platform
into
a
Plexiglas
tube
where
a
shock
was
automatically
delivered
.

Latencies
were
recorded
48
h
later
for
a
testing
trial
.

Ninety

The
extent
of
hypotension
and
changes
in
brain
tissue
oxygenation
(
PbtO(2
)
)
and
in
cerebral
blood
flow
were
studied
in
a
separate
group
of
animals
.

RESULTS
:

All
groups
exhibited
similar
training
latencies
(
17.0
+
/-
4.6
s
)
.

Mice
subjected
to
hypotensive
episodes
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
latency

(
178

)
compared
with
those
injected
with
saline

.

A
Kruskal
-
Wallis
1-way
analysis
of
variance
indicated
a
significant
difference
among
the
4
treatment
groups
(
H
=
15.34
;
P
0.001
)
.

In
a
separate
group
of
mice
not
subjected
to
behavioral
studies
,
the
same
dose
of
NTG

(
n
=
3
)
and
NTG
+
NIMO
(
n
=
3
)
caused
mean
arterial
blood
pressure
to
decrease
from
85.9
+
/-

3.8
mm
Hg
sem
to
31.6
+
/-

/-

3.7
mm

to
32.6

,
respectively
.

Mean
arterial
blood
pressure
in
mice
treated
with
NIMO
alone
decreased
from
88.1
+
/-

3.8
mm

to
80.0
+
/-

2.9
mm
Hg
.

The
intergroup
difference
was
statistically
significant
(
P
0.05
)
.

PbtO(2
)
decreased
from
51.7

to
33.8

to
25.4
+

2.0
mm

in
the
NTG

NIMO
groups
,
respectively
.

There
were
no
significant
differences
among
groups
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
a
PA
retention
paradigm
,
the
injection
of
NTG
immediately
after
learning
produced
a
significant
impairment
of
long
-
term
associative
memory
in
mice
,
whereas
delayed
induced
hypotension
had
no
effect
.

NIMO
attenuated
the
disruption
in
consolidation
of
long
-
term
memory
caused
by
NTG
but
did
not
improve
latency
in
the
absence
of
hypotension
.

The
observed
effect
of
NIMO
may
have
been
attributable
to
the
preservation
of
calcium
homeostasis
during
hypotension
,
because
there
were
no
differences
in
the
PbtO(2
)
indices
among
groups
.

Fatal
haemopericardium
and
gastrointestinal
haemorrhage
due
to
possible
interaction
of
cranberry
juice
with
warfarin
.

We
report
a
case
of
fatal
internal
haemorrhage
in
an
elderly
man
who
consumed
only
cranberry
juice
for
two
weeks
while
maintaining
his
usual
dosage
of
warfarin
.

We
propose
that
naturally
occurring
compounds
such
as
flavonoids
,
which
are
present
in
fruit
juices
,
may
increase
the
potency
of
warfarin
by
competing
for
the
enzymes
that
normally
inactivate
warfarin
.

While
traditionally
regarded
as
foodstuffs
,
consumption
of
fruit
juices
should
be
considered
when
patients
develop
adverse
drug
reactions
.

Isoproterenol
induces
primary
loss
of
dystrophin
in
rat
hearts
:
correlation
with
myocardial
injury
.

The
mechanism
of

isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
damage
is
unknown
,
but
a
mismatch
of
oxygen
supply
vs.
demand
following
coronary
hypotension
and
myocardial
hyperactivity
is
the
best
explanation
for
the
complex
morphological
alterations
observed
.

Severe
alterations
in
the
structural
integrity
of
the
sarcolemma
of
cardiomyocytes
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
caused
by
isoproterenol
.

Taking
into
account
that
the
sarcolemmal
integrity
is
stabilized
by
the
dystrophin
-
glycoprotein
complex
(
DGC
)
that
connects
actin
and
laminin
in
contractile
machinery
and
extracellular
matrix
and
by
integrins
,
this
study
tests
the
hypothesis
that
isoproterenol
affects
sarcolemmal
stability
through
changes
in
the
DGC
and
integrins
.

We
found
different
sensitivity
of
the
DGC
and
integrin
to
isoproterenol
subcutaneous
administration
.

Immunofluorescent
staining
revealed
that
dystrophin
is
the
most
sensitive
among
the
structures
connecting
the
actin
in
the
cardiomyocyte
cytoskeleton
and
the
extracellular
matrix
.

The
sarcomeric
actin
dissolution
occurred
after
the
reduction
or
loss
of
dystrophin
.

Subsequently
,
after
lysis
of
myofilaments
,
gamma
-
sarcoglycan
,
beta
-
dystroglycan
,
beta1-integrin
,
and
laminin
alpha-2
expressions
were
reduced
followed
by
their
breakdown
,
as
epiphenomena
of
the
myocytolytic
process
.

In
conclusion
,
administration
of
isoproterenol
to
rats
results
in
primary
loss
of
dystrophin
,
the
most
sensitive
among
the
structural
proteins
that
form
the
DGC
that
connects
the
extracellular
matrix
and
the
cytoskeleton
in
cardiomyocyte
.

These
changes
,
related
to
ischaemic
injury
,
explain
the
severe
alterations
in
the
structural
integrity
of
the
sarcolemma
of
cardiomyocytes
and
hence
severe
and
irreversible
injury
induced
by
isoproterenol
.

High

fed
obese
rats
are
highly
sensitive
to
doxorubicin

-induced

cardiotoxicity
.

Often
,
chemotherapy
by
doxorubicin

(
Adriamycin
)
is
limited
due
to
life
threatening
cardiotoxicity
in
patients
during
and
posttherapy
.

Recently
,
we
have
shown
that
moderate
diet
restriction
remarkably
protects
against
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

This
cardioprotection
is
accompanied
by
decreased
cardiac
oxidative
stress
and
triglycerides
and
increased
cardiac
fatty
-
acid
oxidation
,
ATP
synthesis
,
and
upregulated
JAK

pathway
.

In
the
current
study
,
we
investigated
whether
a
physiological
intervention
by
feeding
40

(
HFD
)
,
which
induces
obesity
in
male
Sprague

Dawley
rats
(
250

g
)
,
sensitizes
to
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

A
LD(10
)
dose
(
8
mg
doxorubicin
/kg
,
ip
)
administered
on
day
43
of
the
HFD
feeding
regimen
led
to
higher
cardiotoxicity
,
cardiac

,
lipid

,
and
80
%
mortality
in
the
obese

(
OB
)
rats
in
the
absence
of
any
significant
renal

.

Doxorubicin

studies
revealed
no
change
in

and
doxorubicinol

(
toxic
metabolite
)
in
the
normal
diet
-
fed
(
ND
)
and
OB
hearts
.

Mechanistic
studies
revealed
that
OB

are
sensitized
due
to
:
(

In
conclusion
,
HFD

of
lithium
.

In
the
present
case
,
complete
atrioventricular

AV
)
block
with
syncopal
attacks
developed
secondary
to
lithium

,
necessitating

Neuroleptic
malignant

(
NMS
)
is
the
rarest
and
most
serious
of
the
neuroleptic

disorders
.

We
describe
a
case
of
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome

(
NMS
)
associated
with
the
use
of
ziprasidone
.

Although
conventional
neuroleptics
are
more
frequently
associated
with
NMS
,
atypical
antipsychotic
drugs
like
ziprasidone
may
also
be
a
cause
.

The

Role
of
mangiferin
on
biochemical
alterations
and
antioxidant
status
in
isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial

in
rats
.

The
current
study
dealt
with
the
protective
role
of
mangiferin
,
a
polyphenol
from
Mangifera
indica
Linn
.

(
Anacardiaceae
)
,
on
isoproterenol

(
ISPH
)
-induced

myocardial
infarction

(
MI
)
in
rats
through
its
antioxidative
mechanism
.

Subcutaneous
injection
of
ISPH

(
200
mg
/
kg
body
weight
in
1
ml
saline
)
to
rats
for
2
consecutive
days
caused
myocardial
damage
in
rat
heart
,
which
was
determined
by
the
increased
activity
of
serum
lactate
dehydrogenase
(
LDH
)
and
creatine

phosphokinase
isoenzymes
(
CK
-
MB
)
,
increased
uric
acid
level
and
reduced
plasma

iron
binding
capacity
.

The
protective
role
of
mangiferin
was
analyzed
by
triphenyl
tetrazolium
chloride

(
TTC
)
test
used
for
macroscopic
enzyme

enzymic
antioxidants
such
as
cerruloplasmin
,
Vitamin

were
altered
in

.

Upon
pretreatment
with
mangiferin

(
100
mg

suspended
in
2
ml
of
dimethyl
sulphoxide
)
given
intraperitoneally
for
28
days
to
MI
rats
protected
the
above

rose
significantly
upon

administration
as
compared
to

.

From
the
present
study
it
is
concluded
that
mangiferin
exerts
a
beneficial
effect
against

due
to
its

Daidzein
activates

choline
acetyltransferase
from
MC
-
IXC
cells
and
improves
drug
-
induced
amnesia
.

The
choline
acetyltransferase
(
ChAT
)
activator
,
which
enhances
cholinergic
transmission
via
an
augmentation
of
the
enzymatic
production
of
acetylcholine

(
ACh
)
,
is
an
important
factor
in
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer
's
disease

(
AD
)
.

Methanolic
extracts
from
Pueraria
thunbergiana
exhibited
an
activation
effect
(
46
%
)
on
ChAT
in
vitro
.

Via
the
sequential
isolation
of
Pueraria
thunbergiana
,
the
active
component
was
ultimately
identified
as
daidzein

(
4',7-dihydroxy
-
isoflavone
)
.

In
order
to
investigate
the
effects
of
daidzein
from
Pueraria
thunbergiana
on
scopolamine
-induced
impairments
of
learning
and
memory
,
we
conducted
a
series
of
in
vivo
tests
.

Administration
of
daidzein

(
4.5
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
to
mice
was
shown
significantly
to
reverse

scopolamine
-induced

amnesia
,
according
to
the
results
of
a
Y
-
maze
test
.

Injections
of
scopolamine
into
mice
resulted
in
impaired
performance
on
Y
-
maze
tests
(
a
37
%
decreases
in
alternation
behavior
)
.

By
way
of
contrast
,
mice
treated
with
daidzein
prior
to
the
scopolamine
injections
were
noticeably
protected
from
this
performance
impairment
(
an
approximately
12%-21
%
decrease
in
alternation
behavior
)
.

These
results
indicate
that
daidzein
might
play
a
role
in
acetylcholine
biosynthesis
as
a
ChAT
activator
,
and
that
it
also
ameliorates
scopolamine

-induced
amnesia
.

Possible
azithromycin
-associated
hiccups
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
persistent
hiccups
associated
by
azithromycin
therapy
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
76-year
-
old
man
presented
with
persistent
hiccups
after
beginning
azithromycin
for
the
treatment
of
pharyngitis
.

Hiccups
were
persistent
and
exhausting
.

Discontinuation
of
azithromycin
and
therapy
with
baclofen
finally
resolved
hiccups
.

No
organic
cause
of
hiccups
was
identified
despite
extensive
investigation
.

DISCUSSION
:
Pharmacotherapeutic
agents
have
been
uncommonly
associated
with
hiccups
.

Corticosteroids
(
dexamethasone
and
methylprednisolone
)
,
benzodiazepines

(
midazolam
)
and
general
anaesthesia
have
been
the
specific
agents
mentioned
most
frequently
in
the
literature
as
being
associated
with
the
development
of
hiccups
.

Few
cases
of
drug
-
induced
hiccups
have
been
reported
related
to
macrolide
antimicrobials
.

Using
the
Naranjo
adverse
effect
reaction
probability
scale
this
event
could
be
classified
as
possible
(
score
5
points
)
,
mostly
because
of
the
close
temporal
sequence
,
previous
reports
on
this
reaction
with
other
macrolides
and
the
absence
of
any
alternative
explanation
for
hiccups
.

Our
hypothesis
is
that
a
vagal
mechanism
mediated
by
azithromycin
could
be
the
pathogenesis
of
hiccups
in
our
patient
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Diagnosis
of
drug
-
induced
hiccups
is
difficult
and
often
achieved
only
by
a
process
of
elimination
.

However
,
macrolide
antimicrobials
have
been
reported
to
be
associated
with
hiccups
and
vagal
mechanism
could
explain
the
development
of
this
side
-
effect
.

Time
trends
in
warfarin

-associated

hemorrhage
.

The
annual
incidence
of
warfarin
-related
bleeding
at
Brigham
and
Women
's
Hospital
increased
from
0.97/1,000
patient
admissions
in
the
first
time
period
(
January
1995
to
October
1998
)
to
1.19/1,000
patient
admissions
in
the
second
time
period
(
November
1998
to
August
2002
)
of
this
study
.

The
proportion
of
patients
with
major
and
intracranial
bleeding
increased
from
20.2
%
and
1.9
%
,
respectively
,
in
the
first
time
period
,
to
33.3
%
and
7.8
%
,
respectively
,
in
the
second
.

Fatal
haemorrhagic
myocarditis
secondary
to
cyclophosphamide
therapy
.

Haemorrhagic
myocarditis
is
a
rare
but
important
complication
of
cyclophosphamide
therapy
.

Echocardiographic
identification
of
the
disorder
can
be
made
.

We
believe
that
the
ultrasound
features
of
this
disorder
have
not
been
previously
reported
.

Glyceryl
trinitrate
induces
attacks
of
migraine
without
aura
in
sufferers
of
migraine
with
aura
.

Migraine
with
aura
and
migraine
without
aura
have
the
same
pain
phase
,
thus
indicating
that
migraine
with
aura
and
migraine
without
aura
share
a
common
pathway
of
nociception
.

In
recent
years
,
increasing
evidence
has
suggested
that
the
messenger
molecule
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
is
involved
in
pain
mechanisms
of
migraine
without
aura
.

In
order
to
clarify
whether
the
same
is
true
for
migraine
with
aura
,
in
the
present
study
we
examined
the
headache
response
to
intravenous
infusion
of
glyceryl
trinitrate

(
GTN
)
(
0.5
microg
/
kg
/
min
for
20
min
)
in
12
sufferers
of
migraine
with
aura
.

The
specific
aim
was
to
elucidate
whether
an
aura
and/or
an
attack
of
migraine
without
aura
could
be
induced
.

Fourteen
healthy
subjects
served
as
controls
.

Aura
symptoms
were
not
elicited
in
any
subject
.

Headache
was
more
severe
in

migraineurs
than
in
the
controls
during
and
immediately
after
GTN
infusion
(
p=0.037
)
as
well
as
during
the
following
11
h
(
p
=
0.008
)
.

In
the
controls
,
the
GTN
-induced
headache
gradually
disappeared
,
whereas
in
migraineurs
peak
headache
intensity
occurred
at
a
mean
time
of
240
min
post
-
infusion
.

At
this
time
the
induced
headache
in
6
of
12
migraineurs
fulfilled
the
diagnostic
criteria
for
migraine
without
aura
of
the
International
Headache
Society
.

The
results
therefore
suggest
that
NO
is
involved
in
the
pain
mechanisms
of
migraine
with
aura
.

Since
cortical
spreading
depression
has
been
shown
to
liberate
NO
in
animals
,
this
finding
may
help
our
understanding
of
the
coupling
between
cortical
spreading
depression
and
headache
in
migraine
with
aura
.

Stroke
and
cocaine
or
amphetamine
use
.

The
association
of
cocaine
and
amphetamine
use
with
hemorrhagic
and
ischemic
stroke
is
based
almost
solely
on
data
from
case
series
.

The
limited
number
of
epidemiologic
studies
of
stroke
and
use
of
cocaine
and/or
amphetamine
have
been
done
in
settings
that
serve
mostly
the
poor
and/or
minorities
.

This
case
-
control
study
was
conducted
in
the
defined
population
comprising
members
of
Kaiser
Permanente
of
Northern
and
Southern
California
.

We
attempted
to
identify
all
incident

strokes
in
women
ages
15
-
44
years
during
a
3-year
period
using
hospital
admission
and
discharge
records
,
emergency
department
logs
,
and
payment
requests
for
out
-
of
-
plan
hospitalizations
.

We
selected
controls
,
matched
on
age
and
facility
of
usual
care
,
at
random
from
healthy
members
of
the
health
plan
.

We
obtained
information
in
face
-
to
-
face
interviews
.

There
were
347
confirmed
stroke
cases
and
1,021
controls
.

The
univariate
matched
odds
ratio
for
stroke
in
women
who
admitted
to
using
cocaine
and/or
amphetamine
was
8.5
(
95
%
confidence
interval
=
3.6
-
20.0
)
.

After
further
adjustment
for
potential
confounders
,
the
odds
ratio
in
women
who
reported
using
cocaine
and/or
amphetamine
was
7.0
(
95
%
confidence
interval
=
2.8
-
17.9
)
.

The
use
of
cocaine
and/or
amphetamine
is
a
strong
risk
factor
for
stroke
in
this
socioeconomically
heterogeneous
,
insured
urban
population
.

Prevention
of
breast
cancer
with
tamoxifen
:
preliminary
findings
from
the
Italian
randomised
trial
among
hysterectomised
women
.

Italian
Tamoxifen

Prevention
Study
.

BACKGROUND
:

Tamoxifen
is
a
candidate
chemopreventive
agent
in
breast
cancer
,
although
the
drug
may
be
associated
with
the
development
of
endometrial
cancer
.

Therefore
we
did
a
trial
in
hysterectomised
women
of
tamoxifen
as
a
chemopreventive
.

METHODS
:

In
October
,
1992
,
we
started
a
double
-
blind
placebo
-
controlled
,
randomised
trial
of
tamoxifen
in
women
(
mainly
in
Italy
)
who
did
not
have
breast
cancer
and
who
had
had
a
hysterectomy
.

Women
were
randomised
to
receive
tamoxifen
20
mg
per
day
or
placebo
,
both
orally
for
5
years
.

The
original
plan
was
to
follow
the
intervention
phase
by
5
years
'
follow
-
up
.

In
June
,
1997
,
the
trialists
and
the
data
-
monitoring
committee
decided
to
end
recruitment
primarily
because
of
the
number
of
women
dropping
out
of
the
study
.

Recruitment
ended
on
July
11
,
1997
,
and
the
study
will
continue
as
planned
.

The
primary
endpoints
are
the
occurrence
of
and
deaths
from
breast
cancer
.

This
preliminary
interim
analysis
is
based
on
intention
-
to
-
treat
.

FINDINGS
:
5408

women
were
randomised
;
participating
women
have
a
median
follow
-
up
of
46
months
for
major
endpoints
.

41
cases
of
breast
cancer
occurred
so
far
;
there
have
been
no
deaths
from
breast
cancer
.

There
is
no
difference
in
breast
-
cancer
frequency
between
the
placebo
(
22
cases
)
and
tamoxifen
(
19
)
arms
.

There
is
a
statistically
significant
reduction
of
breast
cancer
among
women
receiving
tamoxifen
who
also
used
hormone
-
replacement
therapy
during
the
trial
:
among
390
women
on
such
therapy
and
allocated
to
placebo
,
we
found
eight
cases
of
breast
cancer
compared
with
one
case
among
362
women
allocated
to
tamoxifen
.

Compared
with
the
placebo
group
,
there
was
a
significantly
increased
risk
of
vascular
events
and
hypertriglyceridaemia
among
women
on
tamoxifen
.

INTERPRETATION
:

Although
this
preliminary
analysis
has
low
power
,
in
this
cohort
of
women
at
low
-
to
-
normal
risk
of
breast
cancer
,
the
postulated
protective
effects
of
tamoxifen
are
not
yet
apparent
.

Women
using
hormone
-
replacement
therapy
appear
to
have
benefited
from
use
of
tamoxifen
.

There
were
no
deaths
from
breast
cancer
recorded
in
women
in
the
study
.

It
is
essential
to
continue
follow
-
up
to
quantify
the
long
-
term
risks
and
benefits
of
tamoxifen
therapy
.

A
measure
of
pupillary
oscillation
as
a
marker
of
cocaine

Cocaine
-induced

paranoia

(
CIP
)
remains
an
important
drug
-
induced
model
of
idiopathic
paranoia
for
which
no
psychophysiologic
marker
has
yet
emerged
.

Measures
of
pupillary
oscillation
were
able
to
significantly
distinguish
a
group
of
abstinent
crack
cocaine
abusers
endorsing
past
CIP

(
n
=

)
from
another
group
of

We
report
a
case
of
combined
levomepromazine
-
fluvoxamine
treatment
-

.

It
seems
that
combined
treatment
of

with
phenothiazines
may
possess
proconvulsive
activity
.

treatment
in
a

Comparison
of
the
effectiveness
of
ranitidine
and
cimetidine
in
inhibiting
acid
secretion
in
patients
with
gastric
hypersecretory
states
.

The
H2-
histamine
receptor
antagonists
ranitidine
and
cimetidine
were
compared
for
their
abilities
to
control
gastric
acid
hypersecretion
on
a
short-
and
long
-
term
basis
in
22
patients
with
gastric
acid
hypersecretory
states
.

Nineteen
patients
had

Zollinger
-
Ellison
syndrome
,
one
patient
had
systemic
mastocytosis
,
and
two
patients
had
idiopathic
hypersecretion
.

The
rates
of
onset
of
the
action
of
cimetidine
and
ranitidine
were
the
same
.

The
actions
of
both
drugs
were
increased
by
anticholinergic
agents
,
and
there
was
a
close
correlation
between
the
daily
maintenance
dose
of
each
drug
needed
to
control
acid
secretion
.

However
,
ranitidine
was
threefold
more
potent
than
cimetidine
both
in
acute
inhibition
studies
and
in
the
median
maintenance
dose
needed
(
1.2
g
per
day
for
ranitidine
and
3.6
g
per
day
for
cimetidine
)
.

Sixty
percent
of
the
males
developed
breast
changes
or
impotence
while
taking
cimetidine
and
in
all
cases
these
changes
disappeared
when
cimetidine
was
replaced
by
ranitidine
.

Treatment
with
high
doses
of
cimetidine

(
one
to
60
months
;
median
,
11
months
)
or
ranitidine

(
two
to
31
months
;
median
,
14
months
)
was
not
associated
with
hepatic
or
hematologic
toxicity
or
alterations
of
serum
gastrin
concentrations
,
but
ranitidine
therapy
was
associated
with
a
significantly
lower
serum
creatinine
level
than
seen
with
cimetidine
therapy
.

The
results
show
that
both
drugs
can
adequately
inhibit
acid
secretion
in
patients
with
gastric
hypersecretory
states
.

Both
are
safe
at
high
doses
,
but
ranitidine
is
threefold
more
potent
and
does
not
cause
the
antiandrogen
side
effects
frequently
seen
with
high
doses
of
cimetidine
.

A
catch
in
the
Reye
.

Twenty
-
six
cases
of
Reye
syndrome
from
The
Children
's
Hospital
,
Camperdown
,
Australia
,
occurring
between
1973
and
1982
were
reviewed
.

Of
these
,
20
cases
met
the
US
Public
Health
Service
Centers
for
Disease
Control
criteria
for
the
diagnosis
of
Reye
syndrome
.

Aspirin
or
salicylate
ingestion
had
occurred
in
only
one
of
the
20
cases
(
5
%
)
,
and
paracetamol

(
acetaminophen
)
had
been
administered
in
only
six
of
the
cases
(
30
%
)
.

Pathologic
confirmation
of
the
diagnosis
of
Reye
syndrome
was
accomplished
in
90
%
of
the
cases
.

The
incidence
of
Reye
syndrome
in
New
South
Wales
,
Australia
,
is
estimated
from
this
study
to
be
approximately
nine
cases
per
1
million
children
compared
with
recent
US
data
of
ten
to
20
cases
per
1
million
children
and
three
to
seven
cases
per
1
million
children
in
Great
Britain
.

The
mortality
for
these
Reye
syndrome
cases
in
Australia
was
45
%
as
compared
with
a
32
%
case
-
fatality
rate
in
the
United
States
.

In
Australia
,
the
pediatric
usage
of
aspirin
has
been
extremely
low
for
the
past
25
years
(
less
than
1
%
of
total
dosage
units
sold
)
,
with
paracetamol

(
acetaminophen
)
dominating
the
pediatric
analgesic
and
antipyretic
market
.

Reye
syndrome
may
be
disappearing
from
Australia
despite
a
total
lack
of
association
with
salicylates
or
aspirin
ingestion
,
since
there
were
no
cases
found
at
The
Children
's
Hospital
in
1983
,
1984
,
or
1985
.

St.
Anthony
's
fire
,
then
and
now
:
a
case
report
and
historical
review
.

A
rare
case
of
morbid
vasospasm
,
together
with
striking
angiographic
findings
,
is
described
secondary
to
the
ingestion
of
methysergide
by
a
48-year
-
old
woman
.

A
brief
review
of
the
literature
on
similar
cases
is
presented
.

A
discussion
of
the
history
of
ergot
includes
its
original
discovery
,
the
epidemics
of
gangrene
that
it
has
caused
through
the
ages
and
its
past
and
present
role
in
the
management
of
migraine
headache
.

Despite
the
advent
of
calcium
channel
blockers
and
beta
-
adrenergic
antagonists
,
ergot
preparations
continue
to
play
a
major
role
in
migraine
therapy
,
so
that
the
danger
of
St.

persists
.

Beta-2-adrenoceptor
-
mediated
hypokalemia
and
its
abolishment
by
oxprenolol
.

The
time
course
and
concentration
-
effect
relationship
of

terbutaline
-induced

hypokalemia
was
studied
,
using
computer
-
aided
pharmacokinetic
-
dynamic
modeling
.

Subsequently
we
investigated
the
efficacy
of
oxprenolol
in
antagonizing
such
hypokalemia
,
together
with
the
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
both
drugs
.

Six
healthy
subjects
were
given
a
0.5
mg
subcutaneous
dose
of
terbutaline
on
two
occasions
:
1
hour
after
oral
administration
of
a
placebo
and
1
hour
after
80
mg
oxprenolol
orally
.

In
the
7-hour
period
after
terbutaline
administration
,
plasma
samples
were
taken
for
determination
of
plasma
potassium
levels
and
drug
concentrations
.

The
sigmoid
Emax
model
offered
a
good
description
of
the
relation
between
terbutaline
concentrations
and
potassium
effects
.

Oxprenolol
caused
decreases
of
65
%
and
56
%
of
terbutaline
volume
of
distribution
and
clearance
,
respectively
,
and
an
increase
of
130
%
of
its
AUC
.

In
spite
of
higher
terbutaline
concentrations
after
oxprenolol
pretreatment
,
the
hypokalemia
was
almost
completely
antagonized
by
the
beta
2-blocking
action
.

Midline
B3

serotonin
nerves
in
rat
medulla
are
involved
in
hypotensive
effect
of
methyldopa
.

Previous
experiments
in
this
laboratory
have
shown
that
microinjection
of
methyldopa
onto
the
ventrolateral
cells
of
the
B3
serotonin
neurons
in
the
medulla
elicits
a
hypotensive
response
mediated
by
a
projection
descending
into
the
spinal
cord
.

The
present
experiments
were
designed
to
investigate
the
role
of
the
midline
cells
of
the
B3
serotonin
neurons
in
the
medulla
,
coinciding
with
the
raphe
magnus
.

In
spontaneously
hypertensive
,
stroke
-prone
rats
,
microinjection
of
methyldopa
into
the
area
of
the
midline
B3
serotonin
cell
group
in
the
ventral
medulla
caused
a
potent
hypotension
of
30
-
40
mm
Hg
,
which
was
maximal
2
-
3
h
after
administration
and
was
abolished
by
the
serotonin
neurotoxin
5,7-dihydroxytryptamine

(
5,7-DHT
)
injected
intracerebroventricularly
.

However
,
intraspinal
injection
of
5,7-DHT
to
produce
a
more
selective
lesion
of
only
descending

serotonin
projections
in
the
spinal
cord
did
not
affect
this
hypotension
.

Further
,
5,7-DHT
lesion
of
serotonin
nerves
travelling
in
the
median
forebrain
bundle
,
one
of
the
main
ascending
pathways
from
the
B3
serotonin
cells
,
did
not
affect
the
fall
in
blood
pressure
associated
with
a
midline
B3
serotonin
methyldopa
injection
.

It
is
concluded
therefore
that
,
unlike
the
ventrolateral
B3
cells
which
mediate
a
methyldopa
-induced
hypotension
via
descending
projections
,
the
midline
serotonin
B3
cells
in
the
medulla
contribute
to
the
hypotensive
action
of
methyldopa
,
either
by
way
of
an
ascending
projection
which
does
not
pass
through
the
median
forebrain
bundle
,
or
through
a
projection
restricted
to
the
caudal
brainstem
.

Yohimbine
treatment
of
sexual
side
effects
induced
by
serotonin
reuptake
blockers
.

BACKGROUND
:

Preclinical
and
clinical
studies
suggest
that
yohimbine
facilitates
sexual
behavior
and
may
be
helpful
in
the
treatment
of
male
impotence
.

A
single
case
report
suggests
that
yohimbine
may
be
used
to
treat
the
sexual
side
effects
of
clomipramine
.

This
study
evaluated
yohimbine
as
a
treatment
for
the
sexual
side
effects
caused
by
serotonin
reuptake
blockers
.

METHOD
:

Six
patients
with
either
obsessive
compulsive
disorder
,
trichotillomania
,
anxiety
,
or
affective
disorders
who
suffered
sexual
side
effects
after
treatment
with
serotonin
reuptake
blockers
were
given
yohimbine
on
a
p.r.n
.
basis
in
an
open
clinical
trial
.

Various
doses
of
yohimbine
were
used
to
determine
the
ideal
dose
for
each
patient
.

RESULTS
:

Five
of
the
six
patients
experienced
improved
sexual
functioning
after
taking
yohimbine
.

One
patient
who
failed
to
comply
with
yohimbine
treatment
had
no
therapeutic
effects
.

Side
effects
of
yohimbine
included
excessive
sweating
,
increased
anxiety
,
and
a
wound
-
up
feeling
in
some
patients
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
yohimbine
may
be
an
effective
treatment
for
the
sexual
side
effects
caused
by
serotonin
reuptake
blockers
.

Future
controlled
studies
are
needed
to
further
investigate
the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
yohimbine
for
this
indication
.

Hypersensitivity
immune
reaction
as
a
mechanism
for
dilevalol

-associated

hepatitis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
assess
lymphocyte
reactivity
to
dilevalol
and
to
serum
containing
putative
ex
vivo
dilevalol
antigens
or
metabolites
in
a
case
of
dilevalol
-induced
liver
injury
.

PATIENT
:

A
58-year
-
old
woman
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
dilevalol

-induced

liver
injury
.

METHODS
:
Peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
collected
from
the
patient
were
cultured
in
the
presence
of
a
solution
of
dilevalol
and
also
with
sera
collected
from
a
volunteer
before
and
after
dilevalol
intake
.

A
similar
protocol
was
performed
with
lymphocytes
from
a
healthy
subject
.

RESULTS
:

No
lymphocyte
proliferation
was
observed
either
in
the
patient
or
in
the
healthy
volunteer
in
the
presence
of
dilevalol
solutions
.

A
significant
proliferative
response
to
serum
collected
after
dilevalol
intake
was
observed
in
the
case
of
the
patient
compared
with
the
proliferative
response
to
the
serum
collected
before
the
drug
intake
.

No
reactivity
was
found
when
lymphocytes
from
the
healthy
subject
were
tested
under
similar
conditions
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
methodology
used
allowed
the
detection
of
lymphocyte
sensitization
to
sera
containing
ex
vivo
-
prepared

dilevalol
antigens
,
suggesting
the
involvement
of
an
immunologic
mechanism
in
dilevalol

-induced

liver
injury
.

Reversible
myocardial
hypertrophy
induced
by
tacrolimus
in
a
pediatric
heart
transplant
recipient
:
case
report
.

Tacrolimus
is
a
potent
immunosuppressant
that
is
frequently
used
in
organ
transplantation
.

However
,
adverse
effects
include
cardiac
toxicity
.

Herein
we
describe
transient
myocardial
hypertrophy
induced
by
tacrolimus
after
heart
transplantation
.

The
hypertrophy
caused
no
clinical
symptoms
but
was
noted
because
of
elevation
of
plasma
brain
natriuretic
peptide
concentration
and
confirmed
at
echocardiography
.

Initially
,
allograft
rejection
was
feared
;
however
,
myocardial
biopsy
samples
revealed
only
interstitial
edema
and
mild
myocardial
hypertrophy
;
neither
cellular
nor
humoral
rejection
was
detected
.

The
blood
tacrolimus
concentration
was
higher
than
usual
at
that
time
;
thus
,
tacrolimus
dosage
was
reduced
.

Myocardial
hypertrophy
completely
resolved
upon
reducing
the
target
concentration
of
tacrolimus
and
did
not
recur
,
as
confirmed
at
echocardiography
and
myocardial
biopsy
.

Thus
,
we
conclude
that
tacrolimus
induces
reversible
myocardial
hypertrophy
.

In
patients
receiving
tacrolimus
therapy
,
blood
concentration
should
be
carefully
controlled
and
extreme
attention
paid
to
cardiac
involvement
.

Comparison
of
unilateral
pallidotomy
and
subthalamotomy
findings
in
advanced
idiopathic
Parkinson
's
disease
.

A
prospective
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
pilot
study
to
compare
the
results
of
stereotactic
unilateral
pallidotomy
and
subthalamotomy
in
advanced
idiopathic
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
refractory
to
medical
treatment
was
designed
.

Ten
consecutive
patients
(
mean
age
,
58.4
+
/-
6.8
years
;
7
men
,
3
women
)
with
similar
characteristics
at
the
duration
of
disease
(
mean
disease
time
,
8.4
+
/-

3.5
years
)
,
disabling
motor
fluctuations
(
Hoehn
_
Yahr
stage
3
-
5
in
off
-
drug
phases
)
and
levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias
were
selected
.

All
patients
had
bilateral
symptoms
and
their
levodopa
equivalent
dosing
were
analysed
.

Six
patients
were
operated
on
in
the
globus
pallidus
interna
(
GPi
)
and
four
in
the
subthalamic
nucleus
(
STN
)
.

Clinical
evaluation
included
the
use
of
the
Unified
Parkinson
's
Disease
Rating
Scale
(
UPDRS
)
,
Hoehn_Yahr
score
and
Schwab
England
activities
of
daily
living
(
ADL
)
score
in
'
on'-
and
'
off'-drug
conditions
before
surgery
and
6
months
after
surgery
.

There
was
statistically
significant
improvement
in
all
contralateral
major
parkinsonian

motor
signs
in
all
patients
followed
for
6
months
.

Levodopa
equivalent
daily
intake
was
significantly
reduced
in
the
STN
group
.

Changes
in
UPDRS
,
Hoehn
_
Yahr
and
Schwab
England
ADL
scores
were
similar
in
both
groups
.

Cognitive
functions
were
unchanged
in
both
groups
.

Complications
were
observed
in
two
patients
:
one
had
a
left
homonymous
hemianopsia
after
pallidotomy
and
another
one
developed
left
hemiballistic
movements
3
days
after
subthalamotomy
which
partly
improved
within
1
month
with
Valproate

1000
mg
/
day
.

The
findings
of
this
study
suggest
that
lesions
of
the
unilateral
STN
and
GPi
are
equally
effective
treatment
for
patients
with
advanced
PD
refractory
to
medical
treatment
.

Protective
effects
of
antithrombin
on
puromycin
aminonucleoside

nephrosis
in
rats
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
antithrombin
,
a
plasma
inhibitor
of
coagulation
factors
,
in
rats
with
puromycin
aminonucleoside

-induced

nephrosis
,
which
is
an
experimental
model
of
human
nephrotic
syndrome
.

Antithrombin
(
50
or
500
IU
/
kg
/
i.v
.
)
was
administered
to
rats
once
a
day
for
10
days
immediately
after
the
injection
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
50
mg
/
kg
/
i.v
.
)
.

Treatment
with
antithrombin
attenuated
the
puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced
hematological
abnormalities
.

Puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced

renal
dysfunction
and
hyperlipidemia
were
also
suppressed
.

Histopathological
examination
revealed
severe
renal
damage
such
as
proteinaceous
casts
in
tubuli
and
tubular
expansion
in
the
kidney
of
control
rats
,
while
an
improvement
of
the
damage
was
seen
in
antithrombin
-
treated
rats
.

In
addition
,
antithrombin
treatment
markedly
suppressed
puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced
apoptosis
of
renal
tubular
epithelial
cells
.

Furthermore
,
puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced
increases
in
renal
cytokine
content
were
also
decreased
.

These
findings
suggest
that
thrombin
plays
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside

-induced

nephrotic
syndrome
.

Treatment
with
antithrombin
may
be
clinically
effective
in
patients
with
nephrotic
syndrome
.

Reverse
or
inverted
left
ventricular
apical
ballooning
syndrome

(
reverse
Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy
)
in
a
young
woman
in
the
setting
of
amphetamine
use
.

Transient
left
ventricular
apical
ballooning
syndrome
was
first
described
in
Japan
as
"
Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy
.

"

This
syndrome
has
been
identified
in
many
other
countries
.

Many
variations
of
this
syndrome
have
been
recently
described
in
the
literature
.

One
of
the
rarest
is
the
reverse
type
of
this
syndrome
,
with
hyperdynamic
apex
and
complete

akinesia
of
the
base
(
as
opposed
to
the
classic
apical
ballooning
)
.

In
this
article
,
we
report
an
interesting
case
of
a
young
woman
who
presented
with
this
rare
type
of
reverse
apical
ballooning
syndrome
occurring
after
amphetamine
use
.

This
report
is
followed
by
review
of
the
literature
.

Attenuated
disruption
of
prepulse
inhibition
by
dopaminergic
stimulation
after
maternal
deprivation
and
adolescent
corticosterone
treatment
in
rats
.

The
development
of
schizophrenia
may
include
an
early
neurodevelopmental
stress
component
which
increases
vulnerability
to
later
stressful
life
events
,
in
combination
leading
to
overt
disease
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
an
early
stress
,
in
the
form
of
maternal
deprivation
,
combined
with
a
later
stress
,
simulated
by
chronic
periadolescent

corticosterone
treatment
,
on
behaviour
in
rats
.

Acute
treatment
with
apomorphine
caused
disruption
of
prepulse
inhibition
(
PPI
)
in
controls
and
in
rats
that
had
undergone
either
maternal
deprivation
or
corticosterone
treatment
,
but
was
surprisingly
absent
in
rats
that
had
undergone
the
combined
early
and
late
stress
.

Amphetamine
treatment
significantly
disrupted
PPI
in
both
non
-
deprived
groups
,
but
was
absent
in
both
maternally
deprived
groups
.

The
serotonin
-1A
receptor
agonist
,
8-OH
-
DPAT
,
induced
a
significant
disruption
of
PPI
in
all
groups
.

Amphetamine
-induced

locomotor
hyperactivity
was
similar
in
all
groups
.

These
results
show
an
inhibitory
interaction
of
early
stress
,
caused
by
maternal
deprivation
,
combined
with
'
adolescent
'
stress
,
simulated
by
corticosterone
treatment
,
on
dopaminergic
regulation
of
PPI
.

The
altered
effects
of
apomorphine
and
amphetamine
could
indicate
differential
changes
in
dopamine
receptor
signalling
leading
to
functional
desensitisation
,
or
altered
modulation
of
sensory
gating
in
the
nucleus
accumbens
by
limbic
structures
such
as
the
hippocampus
.

Peripheral
iron
dextran
induced

degeneration
of
dopaminergic
neurons
in
rat
substantia
nigra
.

Iron
accumulation
is
considered
to
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

To
demonstrate
the
relationship
between
peripheral
iron
overload
and
dopaminergic
neuron
loss
in
rat
substantia
nigra
(
SN
)
,
in
the
present
study
we
used
fast
cyclic
voltammetry
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
(
TH
)
immunohistochemistry
,
Perls
'
iron
staining
,
and
high
performance
liquid
chromatography
-
electrochemical
detection
to
study
the
degeneration
of
dopaminergic
neurons
and
increased
iron
content
in
the
SN
of
iron
dextran
overloaded
animals
.

The
findings
showed
that
peripheral
iron
dextran
overload
increased
the
iron
staining
positive
cells
and
reduced
the
number
of
TH
-
immunoreactive
neurons
in
the
SN
.

As
a
result
,
dopamine
release
and
content
,
as
well
as
its
metabolites
contents
were
decreased
in
caudate
putamen
.

Even
more
dramatic
changes
were
found
in
chronic
overload
group
.

These
results
suggest
that
peripheral
iron
dextran
can
increase
the
iron
level
in
the
SN
,
where
excessive
iron
causes
the
degeneration
of
dopaminergic
neurons
.

The
chronic
iron
overload
may
be
more
destructive
to
dopaminergic
neurons
than
the
acute
iron
overload
.

Warfarin
-induced
leukocytoclastic
vasculitis
.

Skin
reactions
associated
with
oral
coumarin

-derived

anticoagulants
are
an
uncommon
occurrence
.

Leukocytoclastic
vasculitis

(
LV
)
is
primarily
a
cutaneous
small
vessel
vasculitis
,
though
systemic
involvement
may
be
encountered
.

We
report
4
patients
with
late
-
onset
LV
probably
due
to
warfarin
.

All
4
patients
presented
with
skin
eruptions
that
developed
after
receiving
warfarin
for
several
years
.

The
results
of
skin
lesion
biopsies
were
available
in
3
patients
,
confirming
LV
Cutaneous
lesions
resolved
in
all
patients
after
warfarin
was
discontinued
.

In
2
of
the
4
patients
,
rechallenge
with
warfarin
led
to
recurrence
of
the
lesions
.

LV
may
be
a
late
-
onset
adverse
reaction
associated
with
warfarin
therapy
.

The
activation
of
spinal
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
receptors
may
contribute
to
degeneration
of
spinal
motor
neurons
induced
by
neuraxial
morphine
after
a
noninjurious
interval
of
spinal
cord
ischemia
.

We
investigated
the
relationship
between
the
degeneration
of
spinal
motor
neurons
and
activation
of
N
-
methyl
-
d
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptors
after
neuraxial
morphine
following
a
noninjurious
interval
of
aortic
occlusion
in
rats
.

Spinal
cord
ischemia
was
induced
by
aortic
occlusion
for
6
min
with
a
balloon
catheter
.

In
a
microdialysis
study
,
10
muL
of
saline
(
group
C
;
n
=
8)
or
30
mug
of
morphine

(
group
M
;
n
=
8)
was
injected
intrathecally
(
IT
)
0.5
h
after
reflow
,
and
30
mug
of
morphine

(
group
SM
;
n
=
8)
or
10
muL
of
saline
(
group
SC
;
n
=
8)
was
injected
IT
0.5
h
after
sham
operation
.

Microdialysis
samples
were
collected
preischemia
,
before
IT
injection
,
and
at
2
,
4
,
8
,
24
,
and
48
h
of
reperfusion
(
after
IT
injection
)
.

Second
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
IT
MK-801
(
30
mug
)
on
the
histopathologic
changes
in
the
spinal
cord
after
morphine

-induced

spastic
paraparesis
.

After
IT
morphine
,
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)

glutamate
concentration
was
increased
in
group
M
relative
to
both
baseline
and
group
C
(
P
0.05
)
.

This
increase
persisted
for
8
hrs
.

IT

MK-801
significantly
reduced
the
number
of
dark
-
stained
alpha
-
motoneurons
after

morphine
-induced
spastic
paraparesis
compared
with
the
saline
group
.

These
data
indicate
that
IT
morphine
induces
spastic
paraparesis
with
a
concomitant
increase
in
CSF
glutamate
,
which
is
involved
in
NMDA
receptor
activation
.

We
suggest
that
opioids
may
be
neurotoxic
in
the
setting
of
spinal
cord
ischemia
via
NMDA
receptor
activation
.

Reduced

,
altered
voltage
dependence
of
inactivation
,
and
increased
susceptibility
to
seizures
in

.

Sodium

beta
-
subunits
modulate
channel
gating
,
assembly
,
and
cell
surface
expression
in
heterologous

systems
.

We
generated
beta2(-/-

mice
to
investigate
the
role
of
beta2
in
control
of
sodium

density
,

,
and
function
in
neurons
in

.

Measurements
of
[

STX
)
binding
showed
a
significant
reduction
in
the
level
of
plasma
membrane
sodium
channels
in
beta2(-/-
)
neurons
.

The
loss
of
beta2
resulted
in
negative
shifts
in
the
voltage
dependence
of
inactivation
as
well
as
significant
decreases
in
sodium
current
density
in
acutely
dissociated
hippocampal
neurons
.

The
integral
of
the
compound
action
potential
in
optic
nerve
was
significantly
reduced
,
and
the
threshold
for
action
potential
generation
was
increased
,
indicating
a
reduction
in
the
level
of
functional
plasma

.

In
contrast
,

mice
displayed
increased

as
indicated
by
reduced

for
pilocarpine

-induced

,
but
seemed

Our

Screening
for
stimulant
use
in
adult
emergency
department
seizure
patients
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
prevalence
of
positive
plasma
drug
screening
for
cocaine
or
amphetamine
in
adult
emergency
department
seizure
patients
.

METHODS
:

This
prospective
study
evaluated
consecutive
eligible
seizure
patients
who
had
a
plasma
sample
collected
as
part
of
their
clinical
evaluation
.

Plasma
was
tested
for
amphetamine
and
the
cocaine
metabolite
benzoylecgonine
using
enzyme
-
mediated
immunoassay
methodology
.

Plasma
samples
with
benzoylecgonine

greater
than
150
ng
/
mL
or
an
amphetamine
greater
than
500
ng
/
mL
were
defined
as
positive
.

Patient
demographics
,
history
of
underlying
drug
or
alcohol
-related
seizure
disorder
,
estimated
time
from
seizure
to
sample
collection
,
history
or
suspicion
of
cocaine
or
amphetamine
abuse
,
results
of
clinical
urine
testing
for
drugs
of
abuse
,
and
assay
results
were
recorded
without
patient
identifiers
.

RESULTS
:

Fourteen
of
248
(
5.6
%
,
95
%
CI

2.7%-8.5
%
)
plasma
samples
were
positive
by
immunoassay
testing
for
benzoylecgonine
and
no
samples
(
0
%
,
95
%
CI
0
-
1.2
%
)
were
positive
for
amphetamine
.

Positive
test
results
were
more
common
in
patient
visits
where
there
was
a
history
or
suspicion
of
cocaine
or
amphetamine
abuse
(
p
0.0005
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

During
this
study
period
,
routine
plasma
screening
for
cocaine
and
amphetamines
in
adult
seizure
patients
had
a
low
yield
.

As
a
result
,
routine
plasma
screening
would
yield
few
cases
of
stimulant
drug
in
which
there
was
neither
a
history
nor
suspicion
of
drug
abuse
in
this
population
.

Evidence
of
functional
somatotopy
in
GPi
from
results
of
pallidotomy
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
explore
the
functional
anatomy
of
the
globus
pallidus
internus
(
GPi
)
by
studying
the
effects
of
unilateral
pallidotomy
on
parkinsonian
'
off
'
signs
and
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
(
LID
)
.

We
found
significant
positive
correlations
between
the
preoperative
levodopa
responsiveness
of
motor
signs
and
the
levodopa
responsiveness
of
scores
in
timed
tests
(
Core
Assessment
Program
for
Intracerebral
Transplantations
)
in
the
contralateral
limbs
and
the
improvement
in
these
scores
after
surgery
,
whereas
there
was
no
correlation
with
the
improvement
in
LID
.

We
also
found
a
highly
significant
correlation
(
P
:
0.0001
,
r
=
0.8
)
between
the
volume
of
the
ventral
lesion
in
the
GPi
and
the
improvement
in
LID
in
the
contralateral
limbs
,
whereas
there
was
no
correlation
between
the
ventral
volume
and
the
improvement
in
parkinsonian
'
off
'
signs
.

The
volumes
of
the
total
lesion
cylinder
and
the
dorsal
lesion
did
not
correlate
with
the
outcome
of
either
dyskinesias
or
parkinsonian
'
off
'
signs
.

The
differential
predictive
value
of
levodopa
responsiveness
for
the
outcome
of
parkinsonian
'
off
'
signs
and
LID
and
the
different
correlations
of
ventral
lesion
volume
with
dyskinesias
and
parkinsonian
'
off
'
signs
indicate
that
different
anatomical
or
pathophysiological
substrates
may
be
responsible
for
the
generation
of
parkinsonian
'
off
'
signs
and
dyskinesias
.

Whereas
cells
in
a
wider
area
of
the
GPi
may
be
implicated
in
parkinsonism
,
the
ventral
GPi
seems
to
be
crucial
for
the
manifestation
of
LID
.

We
suggest
that
our
observations
are
additional
proof
of
the
functional
somatotopy
of
the
systems
within
the
GPi
that
mediate
parkinsonism
and
dyskinesias
,
especially
along
the
dorsoventral
trajectory
used
in
pallidotomy
.

The
outcome
of
pallidotomy
in
which
the
lesion
involves
the
ventral
and
dorsal
GPi
could
be
the
net
effect
of
alteration
in
the
activity
of
pathways
which
mediate
different
symptoms
,
and
hence
could
be
variable
.

Pain
responses
in
methadone

-maintained
opioid
abusers
.

Providing
pain
management
for
known
opioid
abusers
is
a
challenging
clinical
task
,
in
part
because
little
is
known
about
their
pain
experience
and
analgesic
requirements
.

This
study
was
designed
to
describe
pain
tolerance
and
analgesic
response
in
a
sample
of
opioid
addicts
stabilized
in

methadone
-maintenance

(
MM
)
treatment
(
n
=
60
)
in
comparison
to
matched
nondependent
control
subjects
(
n
=
60
)
.

By
using
a
placebo
-
controlled
,
two
-
way
factorial
design
,
tolerance
to
cold
-
pressor
(
CP
)
pain
was
examined
,
both
before
and
after
oral
administration
of
therapeutic
doses
of
common
opioid
(
hydromorphone
2
mg
)
and
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
(
ketorolac
10
mg
)
analgesic
agents
.

Results
showed
that
MM
individuals
were
significantly
less
tolerant
of
CP
pain
than
control
subjects
,
replicating
previous
work
.

Analgesic
effects
were
significant
neither
for
medication
nor
group
.

These
data
indicate
that
MM
opioid
abusers
represent
a
pain
-
intolerant
subset
of
clinical
patients
.

Their
complaints
of
pain
should
be
evaluated
seriously
and
managed
aggressively
.

Urine
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
D
-
glucosaminidase
--
a
marker
of
tubular
damage
?

BACKGROUND
:

Although
an
indicator
of
renal
tubular
dysfunction
,
an
increased
urinary
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
D
-
glucosaminidase
(
NAG
)
activity
might
reflect
increased
lysosomal
activity
in
renal
tubular
cells
.

METHODS
:
Puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)
was
administered
to
Sprague
Dawley
rats
to
induce
proteinuria
.

Total
protein
,
albumin
,
NAG
activity
and
protein
electrophoretic
pattern
were
assessed
in
daily
urine
samples
for
33
days
.

The
morphological
appearance
of
the
kidneys
was
examined
on
days
three
,
four
,
six
,
eight
and
thirty
three
and
the
NAG
isoenzyme
patterns
on
days
zero
,
four
,
eight
and
thirty
three
.

RESULTS
:

Following
intravenous
PAN
urine
volume
and
urine
NAG
activity
increased
significantly
by
day
two
,
but
returned
to
normal
by
day
four
.

After
day
four
all
treated
animals
exhibited
a
marked
rise
in
urine
albumin
,
total
protein
excretion
and
NAG
activity
.

Electrophoresis
showed
a
generalised
increase
in
middle
and
high
molecular
weight
urine
proteins
from
day
four
onwards
.

Protein
droplets
first
appeared
prominent
in
tubular
cells
on
day
four
.

Peak
urine
NAG
activity
and
a
change
in
NAG
isoenzyme
pattern
coincided
with
both
the
peak
proteinuria
and
the
reduction
in
intracellular
protein
and
NAG
droplets
(
day
six
onwards
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
animal
model
demonstrates
that
an
increase
in
lysosomal
turnover
and
hence
urine
NAG
activity
,
occurs
when
increased
protein
is
presented
to
the
tubular
cells
.

Urine
NAG
activity
is
thus
a
measure
of
altered
function
in
the
renal
tubules
and
not
simply
an
indicator
of
damage
.

Over
expression
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
and
its
receptor
during
the
development
of
estrogen
-induced
rat

pituitary
tumors
may
mediate
estrogen
-initiated

tumor
angiogenesis
.

Estrogens
,
which
have
been
associated
with
several
types
of
human
and
animal
cancers
,
can
induce
tumor
angiogenesis
in
the
pituitary
of
Fischer
344
rats
.

The
mechanistic
details
of
tumor
angiogenesis
induction
,
during
estrogen
carcinogenesis
,
are
still
unknown
.

To
elucidate
the
role
of
estrogen
in
the
regulation
of
tumor
angiogenesis
in
the
pituitary
of
female
rats
,
the
density
of
blood
vessels
was
analysed
using
factor
VIII
related
antigen
(
FVIIIRAg
)
immunohistochemistry
and
the
expression
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
/
vascular
permeability
factor
(
VEGF
/
VPF
)
was
examined
by
Western
blot
and
immunohistochemical
analysis
.

The
expression
of
VEGF
receptor
(
VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR
)
was
also
examined
by
immunohistochemistry
.

The
results
demonstrated
that
17beta
-
estradiol

(
E2
)
induces
neovascularization
,
as
well
as
the
growth
and
enlargement
of
blood
vessels
after
7
days
of
exposure
.

The
high
tumor
angiogenic
potential
was
associated
with
an
elevated
VEGF
/
VPF
protein
expression
in
the
E2

exposed
pituitary
of
ovariectomized
(
OVEX
)
rats
.

VEGF
/
VPF
and
FVIIIRAg
immunohistochemistry
and
endothelial
specific
lectin
(
UEA1
)
binding
studies
,
indicate
that
the
elevation
of
VEGF
protein
expression
initially
occurred
in
both
blood
vessels
and
non
-
endothelial
cells
.

After
15
days
of
E2
exposure
,
VEGF
/
VPF
protein
expression
,
in
the
non
-
endothelial
cell
population
,
sharply
declined
and
was
restricted
to
the
blood
vessels
.

The
function
of
non
-
endothelial
-
derived
VEGF
is
not
clear
.

Furthermore
,
immunohistochemical
studies
demonstrated
that
VEGFR-2
(
flk-1/KDR
)
,
expression
was
elevated
significantly
in
the
endothelial
cells
of
microblood
vessels
after
7
days
of
E2
exposure
.

These
findings
suggest
that
over
expression
of
VEGF
and
its
receptor
(
VEGFR-2
)
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
initial
step
of
the
regulation
of
estrogen
induced
tumor
angiogenesis
in
the
rat
pituitary
.

Pravastatin
-associated
myopathy
.

Report
of
a
case
.

A
case
of
acute
inflammatory
myopathy
associated
with
the
use
of
pravastatin
,
a
new
hydrophilic
3-hydroxy-3
methylglutaril
coenzyme
A
reductase
inhibitor
,
is
reported
.

The
patient
,
a
69-year
-
old
man
was
affected
by
non
-
insulin
-
dependent
diabetes
mellitus
and
hypertension
.

He
assumed
pravastatin

(
20
mg
/
day
)
because
of
hypercholesterolemia
.

He
was
admitted
with
acute
myopathy
of
the
lower
limbs
which
resolved
in
a
few
days
after
pravastatin
discontinuation
.

A
previously
unknown
hypothyroidism
,
probably
due
to
chronic
autoimmune
thyroiditis
,
was
evidenced
.

Muscle
biopsy
(
left
gastrocnemius
)
revealed
a
perimysial
and
endomysial
inflammatory
infiltrate
with
a
prevalence
of
CD4
+
lymphocytes
.

While
lovastatin
and
simvastatin
have
been
associated
with
toxic
myopathy
,
pravastatin
-associated

myopathy
could
represent
a
distinct
,
inflammatory
entity
.

Dose
-
effect
and
structure
-
function
relationships
in
doxorubicin
cardiomyopathy
.

The
cardiomyopathy

(
CM
)
produced
by
the
anticancer
drug
doxorubicin

(
DXR
)
(
Adriamycin
)
provides
a
unique
opportunity
to
analyze
dose
-
effect
and
structure
-
function
relationships
during
development
of
myocardial
disease
.

We
measured
the
degree
of
morphologic
damage
by
ultrastructural
examination
of
endomyocardial
biopsy
and
the
degree
of
performance
abnormally
by
right
heart
catheterization
in
patients
receiving
DXR
.

Morphologic
damage
was
variable
but
was
proportional
to
the
total
cumulative
DXR
dose
between
100
and
600
mg
/
m2
.

Performance
abnormalities
correlated
weakly
with
dose
,
exhibited
a
curvilinear
relationship
,
and
had
a
"
threshold
"
for
expression
.

Catheterization
abnormalities
correlated
well
with
morphologic
damage
(
r
=
0.57
to
0.78
)
in
a
subgroup
of
patients
in
whom
exercise
hemodynamics
were
measured
,
and
this
relationship
also
exhibited
a
curvilinear
,
threshold
configuration
.

In
DXR
-
CM
myocardial
damage
is
proportional
to
the
degree
of
cytotoxic
insult
(
DXR
dose
)
while
myocardial
function
is
preserved
until
a
critical
dose
or
degree
of
damage
is
reached
,
after
which
myocardial
performance
deteriorates
rapidly
.

Fatal
aplastic
anemia

following
topical
administration
of
ophthalmic
chloramphenicol
.

A
73-year
-
old
woman
died
of
aplastic
anemia
less
than
two
months
after
undergoing
cataract
extraction
and
beginning
topical
therapy
with
chloramphenicol
.

The
first
signs
of
pancytopenia
began
within
one
month
of
the
surgery
.

The
pattern
of
the
aplastic
anemia
was
associated
with
an
idiosyncratic
response
to
chloramphenicol
.

This
was
the
second
report
of
fatal
aplastic
anemia
after
topical
treatment
with
chloramphenicol
for
ocular
conditions
,
although
two
cases
of
reversible
bone
marrow
hypoplasia
have
also
been
reported
.

Any
other
suspected
cases
of
ocular
toxicity
associated
with
topically
applied

chloramphenicol
should
be
reported
to
the
National
Registry

Bradycardia
due
to
trihexyphenidyl
hydrochloride
.

A
chronic
schizophrenic
patient
was
treated
with
an
anticholinergic
drug
,
trihexyphenidyl
hydrochloride
.

The
patient
developed
,
paradoxically
,
sinus
bradycardia
.

The
reaction
was
specific
to
trihexyphenidyl
and
not
to
other
anticholinergic
drugs
.

This
antidyskinetic
drug
is
widely
used
in
clinical
psychiatric
practice
and
physicians
should
be
aware
of
this
side
effect
.

Experimental
cyclosporine

nephrotoxicity
:
risk
of
concomitant
chemotherapy
.

The
role
of
cyclosporine

(
CSA
)
alone
or
in
combination
with
various
chemotherapeutics
in
the
development
of
renal
toxicity
was
evaluated
in
rats
.

Administration
of
20
mg
/
kg
/
day
CSA
for
4
weeks
caused
renal
functional
and
structural
changes
similar
to
those
reported
in
man
.

The
combined
administration
of
CSA
and
various
chemotherapeutic
drugs
with
a
nephrotoxic
potential
,
such
as
gentamicin
(
at
therapeutic
doses
)
,

amphothericin
B
and
ketoconazole
,
which
are
frequently
used
in
immunosuppressed
patients
,
did
not
aggravate
the
CSA
induced

toxicity
in
the
rat
model
.

Gentamicin
at
toxic
doses
,
however
,
increased

CSA

nephrotoxicity
.

Thus
,
the
nephrotoxicity
induced
by
CSA
has
a
different
pathogenetic
mechanism
.

Receptor
mechanisms
of
nicotine
-induced

locomotor
hyperactivity
in
chronic
nicotine
-treated
rats
.

Rats
were
pretreated
with
saline
or
nicotine
(
1.5
mg
/
kg
per
day
)
by
subcutaneously
implanting
each
animal
with
an
Alzet
osmotic
mini
-
pump
which
continuously
released
saline
or
nicotine
for
1
,
5
and
14
days
.

At
the
end
of
each
pretreatment
period
,
animals
were
used
for
(
i
)
determining
their
locomotor
response
to
acutely
injected
nicotine
(
0.2
mg
/
kg
,
s.c
.
)

and
(
ii
)
measuring
the
density
of
L-[3H
]
nicotine
and
[
3H
]
spiperone
binding
sites
in
the
striatum
.

We
observed
no
changes
in
nicotine

-induced
locomotor
response
,
striatal
L-[3H
]
nicotine
and
[
3H
]
spiperone
binding
in
the
animals
pretreated
with
nicotine
for
1
day
.

In
rats
which
were
pretreated
with
nicotine
for
5
days
,
there
was
a
significant
increase
in
the
nicotine
-stimulated
locomotor
response
which
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
number
of
L-[3H
]
nicotine
binding
sites
and
also
with
an
elevated
dopamine

(
DA
)
level
in
the
striatum
.

The
number
of
striatal
[
3H
]
spiperone
binding
sites
was
not
affected
.

In
animals
pretreated
with
nicotine
for
14
days
,
the
nicotine
-induced
locomotor
response
remained
to
be
potentiated
.

However
,
this
response
was
correlated
with
an
elevated
number
of
striatal
[
3H
]
spiperone
binding
sites
,
whereas
the
number
of
striatal
L-[3H
]
nicotine
binding
sites
and
the
striatal
DA
level
were
normal
.

These
results
suggest
that
chronic
nicotine

-treated
rats
develop

locomotor
hyperactivity
in
response
to
nicotine
initially
due
to
increases
of
both
the
density
of
nicotinic
receptors
and
DA
concentration
,
followed
by
inducing
DA
receptor
supersensitivity
in
the
striatum
.

Hydrocortisone
-induced
hypertension
in
humans
:
pressor
responsiveness
and
sympathetic
function
.

Oral
hydrocortisone
increases
blood
pressure
and
enhances
pressor
responsiveness
in
normal
human
subjects
.

We
studied
the
effects
of
1
week
of
oral
hydrocortisone
(
200
mg
/
day
)
on
blood
pressure
,
cardiac

,
total
peripheral

,
forearm

,
and
norepinephrine

Effects
of
suprofen
on
the
isolated
perfused
rat
kidney
.

Although
suprofen
has
been
associated
with
the
development
of
acute
renal
failure
in
greater
than
100
subjects
,
the
mechanism
of
damage
remains
unclear
.

The
direct
nephrotoxic
effects
of
a
single
dose
of
15
mg
of
suprofen
were
compared
in
the
recirculating
isolated
rat
kidney
perfused
with
cell
-
free
buffer
with
or
without
the
addition
of
5
mg
/
dL
of
uric
acid
.

There
were
no
significant
differences
in
renal
sodium
excretion
,
oxygen
consumption
,
or
urinary
flow
rates
in
kidneys
perfused
with
suprofen
compared
with
the
drug
-
free
control
groups
.

In
contrast
,
a
significant
decline
in
glomerular
filtration
rate
was
found
after
the
introduction
of
suprofen
to
the
kidney
perfused
with
uric
acid
;
no
changes
were
found
with
suprofen
in
the
absence
of
uric
acid
.

A
significant
decrease
in
the
baseline
excretion
rate
of
uric
acid
was
found
in
rats
given
suprofen
,
compared
with
drug
-
free
controls
.

However
,
the
fractional
excretion
of
uric
acid
was
unchanged
between
the
groups
over
the
experimental
period
.

In
summary
,
suprofen
causes

acute
declines
in
renal
function
,
most
likely
by
directly
altering
the
intrarenal
distribution
of
uric
acid
.

Cocaine
-induced
brainstem
seizures
and
behavior
.

A
variety
of
abnormal
sensory
/
motor
behaviors
associated
with
electrical
discharges
recorded
from
the
bilateral
brainstem
were
induced
in
adult
WKY
rats
by
mechanical
(
electrode
implants
)
and
DC
electrical
current
stimulations
and
by
acute
and
chronic
administration
of
cocaine
.

The
electrode
implant
implicated
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
reticular
system
of
the
brainstem
but
subjects
were
not
incapacitated
by
the
stimulations
.

Cocaine

(
40
mg
/
kg
)
was
injected
subcutaneously
for
an
acute
experiment
and
subsequent
20
mg
/
kg
doses
twice
daily
for
3
days
in
a
chronic
study
.

Cocaine
generated
more
abnormal
behaviors
in
the
brainstem
perturbation
group
,
especially
the
electrically
perturbated
subjects
.

The
abnormal
behaviors
were
yawning
,
retrocollis
,
hyperactivity
,
hypersensitivity
,
"
beating
drum
"
behavior
,
squealing
,
head
bobbing
,
circling
,
sniffing
,
abnormal
posturing
,
and
facial
twitching
.

Shifts
in
the
power
frequency
spectra
of
the
discharge
patterns
were
noted
between
quiet
and
pacing
behavioral
states
.

Hypersensitivity
to
various
auditory
,
tactile
,
and
visual
stimulation
was
present
and
shifts
in
the
brainstem
ambient
power
spectral
frequency
occurred
in
response
to
tactile
stimulation
.

These
findings
suggest
that
the
brainstem
generates
and
propagates
pathological
discharges
that
can
be
elicited
by
mechanical
and
DC
electrical
perturbation
.

Cocaine
was
found
to
activate
the
discharge
system
and
thus
induce
abnormal
behaviors
that
are
generated
at
the
discharge
site
and
at
distant
sites
to
which
the
discharge
propagates
.

Cognitive
functions
may
also
be
involved
since
dopaminergic
and
serotonergic
cellular
elements
at
the
brainstem
level
are
also
implicated
.

Increased
sulfation
and
decreased
7alpha
-
hydroxylation
of
deoxycholic
acid
in

ethinyl
estradiol
-induced

cholestasis
in
rats
.

Deoxycholic
acid
conjugation
,
transport
capacity
,
and
metabolism
were
compared
in
control
and
ethinyl
estradiol
-treated
rats
.

Control
rats
were
found
to
have
a
lower
capacity
to
transport
deoxycholic
acid
than
taurodeoxycholic
acid
,
and
both
were
decreased
by
ethinyl
estradiol
treatment
.

During
[
24
-
14C
]
sodium
deoxycholate
infusion
,
[
14C]biliary
bile
acid
secretion
increased
,
but
bile
flow
did
not
change
significantly
in
either
control
or
ethinyl
estradiol
-treated
rats
.

Ethinyl
estradiol

-treated
animals
excreted
significantly
less
14C
as
taurocholic
acid
than
did
control
animals
,
consistent
with
an
impairment
of
7alpha
-
hydroxylation
of
taurodeoxycholic
acid
.

Ethinyl
estradiol
treatment
did
not
impair
conjugation
of
deoxycholic
acid
,
but
did
result
in
an
increase
in
sulfation
of
taurodeoxycholic
acid
from
1.5
%
in
controls
to
nearly
4.0
%
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
.

These
results
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
the
rat
has
a
poorer
tolerance
for
deoxycholic
acid
than
do
certain
other
species
.

Furthermore
,
the
rat
converts

deoxycholic
acid
,
a
poor
choleretic
,
to
taurocholic
acid
,
a
good
choleretic
.

When
this
conversion
is
impaired
with
ethinyl
estradiol
treatment
,
sulfation
may
be
an
important
alternate
pathway
for
excretion
of
this
potentially
harmful
bile
acid
.

Effects
of
ouabain
on
myocardial
oxygen
supply
and
demand
in
patients
with
chronic
coronary
artery
disease
.

A
hemodynamic
,
volumetric
,
and
metabolic
study
in
patients
without
heart
failure
.

The
effects
of
digitalis
glycosides
on
myocardial
oxygen
supply
and
demand
are
of
particular
interest
in
the
presence
of
obstructive
coronary
artery
disease
,
but
have
not
been
measured
previously
in
man
.

We
assessed
the
effects
of
ouabain

(
0.015
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
on
hemodynamic
,
volumetric
,
and
metabolic
parameters
in
11
patients
with
severe
chronic
coronary
artery
disease
without
clinical
congestive
heart
failure
.

Because
the
protocol
was
long
and
involved
interventions
which
might
affect
the
determinations
,
we
also
studied
in
nine
patients
using
an
identical
protocol
except
that
ouabain
administration
was
omitted
.

Left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
pressure
and
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
volume
fell
in
each
patient
given
ouabain
,
even
though
they
were
initially
elevated
in
only
two
patients
.

Left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
pressure
fell
from
11.5+/-1.4

(
mean+/-SE
)
to
5.6+/-0.9
mm
Hg
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
and
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
volume
fell
from
100+/-17
to
82+/-12
ml
/
m2
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
1
h
after
ouabain
infusion
was
completed
.

The
maximum
velocity
of
contractile
element
shortening
increased
from
1.68+/-0.11
ml
/
s
to
2.18+/-0.21
muscle
-
lengths
/
s
(
P
less
than
0.05
)
and
is
consistent
with
an
increase
in
contractility
.

No
significant
change
in
these
parameters
occurred
in
the
control
patients
.

No
significant
change
in
myocardial
oxygen
consumption
occurred
after
ouabain
administration
but
this
may
be
related
to
a
greater
decrease
in
mean
arterial
pressure
in
the
ouabain
patients
than
in
the
control
patients
.

We
conclude
that
in
patients
with
chronic
coronary
artery
disease
who
are
not
in
clinical
congestive
heart
failure
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
volume
falls
after
ouabain
administration
even
when
it
is
initially
normal
.

Though
this
fall
would
be
associated
with
a
decrease
in
wall
tension
,
and
,
therefore
,
of
myocardial
oxygen
consumption
,
it
may
not
be
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
prevent
a
net
increase
in
myocardial
oxygen
consumption
.

Nevertheless
,
compensatory
mechanisms
prevent
a
deterioration
of
resting
myocardial
metabolism
.

Prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
related
to
cisapride
-
diltiazem
interaction
.

Cisapride
,
a
cytochrome
P450
3A4
(
CYP3A4
)
substrate
,
is
widely
prescribed
for
the
treatment
of
gastrointestinal
motility
disorders
.

Prolongation
of
QT
interval
,
torsades
de
pointes
,
and
sudden
cardiac
death
have
been
reported
after
concomitant
administration
with
erythromycin
or
azole
antifungal
agents
,
but
not
with
other
CYP3A4
inhibitors
.

A
possible
drug
interaction
occurred
in
a
45-year
-
old
woman
who
was
taking
cisapride
for
gastroesophageal
reflux
disorder
and
diltiazem
,
an
agent
that
has
inhibitory
effect
on
CYP3A4
,
for
hypertension
.

The
patient
was
in
near
syncope
and
had
QT
-
interval
prolongation
.

After
discontinuing
cisapride
,
the
QT
interval
returned
to
normal
and
symptoms
did
not
recur
.

We
suggest
that
caution
be
taken
when
cisapride
is
prescribed
with
any
potent
inhibitor
of
CYP3A4
,
including
diltiazem
.

Paclitaxel
combined
with
carboplatin
in
the
first
-
line
treatment
of
advanced
ovarian
cancer
.

In
a
phase
I
study
to
determine
the
maximum
tolerated
dose
of
paclitaxel

(
Taxol
;
Bristol
-
Myers
Squibb
Company
,
Princeton
,
NJ
)
given
as
a
3-hour
infusion
in
combination
with
carboplatin
administered
every
21
days
to
women
with
advanced
ovarian
cancer
,
paclitaxel
doses
were
escalated
as
follows
:
level
1
,
135
mg
/
m2
;
level
2
,
160
mg
/
m2
;
level
3
,
185
mg
/
m2
;
and
level
4,210
mg
/
m2
.

The
fixed
dose
of
carboplatin
at
levels
1
through
4
was
given
to
achieve
an
area
under
the
concentration
-
time
curve
(
AUC
)
of
5
using
the
Calvert
formula
.

In
levels
5
and
6
the
carboplatin
dose
was
targeted
at
AUCs
of
6
and
7.5
,
respectively
,
combined
with
a
fixed
paclitaxel
dose
of
185
mg
/
m2
.

To
date
,
30
previously
untreated
patients
,
all
with
a
good
performance
status
(
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
0
to
2
)
have
been
entered
into
this
ongoing
study
.

The
dose
-
limiting
toxicity
of
the
combination
was
myelosuppression

(
leukopenia
,
granulocytopenia
,
and
thrombocytopenia
)
.

Neurotoxicity
was
largely
moderate
.

So
far
,
14
patients
are
evaluable
for
response
;
of
these
,
eight
(
57
%
)
showed
objective
(
complete
or
partial
)
response
and
disease
stabilized
in
six
patients
.

No
patient
had
disease
progression
.

We
conclude
that
the
combination
of
paclitaxel

185
mg
/
m2
administered
as
a
3-hour
infusion
followed
immediately
by
a
1-hour
infusion
of
carboplatin
at
an
AUC
of
6
can
be
administered
safely
in
a
21-day
schedule
in
the
outpatient
setting
.

The
recommended
dose
for
phase
III
studies
is
paclitaxel

185
mg
/
m2
and
carboplatin
AUC
6
.

Treatment
of
tacrolimus
-related
adverse
effects
by
conversion
to
cyclosporine
in
liver
transplant
recipients
.

When
tacrolimus
side
effects
persist
despite
dose
reduction
,
conversion
to
cyclosporine
-based
immunosuppression
(
CyA
)
is
necessary
.

We
characterized
tacrolimus
side
effects
that
warranted
discontinuation
of
the
drug
,
and
outcomes
after
conversion
.

Of
388
liver
recipients
who
received
tacrolimus
as
primary
immunosuppression
,
70
required
conversion
to
CyA.

We
recorded
indication
for
conversion
,
whether
conversion
was
early
or
late
after
transplantation
,
tacrolimus
dose
and
trough
blood
level
at
conversion
,
and
incidence
of
rejection
after
conversion
.

Conversion
was
early
in
29
patients
(
41.4
%
)
and
late
in
41
(
58.6
%
)
.

Indications
for
early

were
neurotoxicity

,
and
for
late
conversion
were
neurotoxicity
(

)
,
IDDM
(

)
,
nephrotoxicity
(

,

(

)
,
and
pruritus
(

.

All
early

patients
showed
improvement
/
resolution
of
symptoms
.

Among
late
-
conversion
patients
,
37
(
90.2
%
)
had
improvement
/
resolution
;
in
4
(
9.8
%
)
,
adverse

persisted
.

The
overall

When

are
unresponsive
to

,
conversion
to

can
be
accomplished
safely

Relative
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
netilmicin
and
tobramycin
in
oncology
patients
.

We
prospectively
compared
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
netilmicin
sulfate
or
tobramycin
sulfate
in
conjunction
with
piperacillin
sodium
in
118
immunocompromised
patients
with
presumed
severe
infections
.

The
two
treatment
regimens
were
equally
efficacious
.

Nephrotoxicity
occurred
in
a
similar
proportion
in
patients
treated
with
netilmicin
and
tobramycin

(
17
%
vs
11
%
)
.

Ototoxicity
occurred
in
four
(
9.5
%
)
of
42

netilmicin
and
piperacillin
and
in
12
(
22
%
)
of
54
tobramycin
and
piperacillin

-treated
patients
.

Of
those
evaluated
with
posttherapy
audiograms
,
three
of
four
netilmicin
and
piperacillin

-treated
patients
had
auditory
thresholds
return
to
baseline
compared
with
one
of
nine
tobramycin
and
piperacillin
-treated
patients
.

The
number
of
greater
than
or
equal
to
15-dB
increases
in
auditory
threshold
as
a
proportion
of
total
greater
than
or
equal
to
15-dB
changes
(
increases
and
decreases
)
was
significantly
lower
in

netilmicin
and
piperacillin
-
vs
tobramycin
and
piperacillin

-treated
patients
(
18
of
78
vs
67
of
115
)
.

We
conclude
that
aminoglycoside
-associated
ototoxicity
was
less
severe
and
more
often
reversible
with
netilmicin
than
with
tobramycin
.

Effect
of
prostaglandin
synthetase
inhibitors
on
experimentally
induced
convulsions
in
rats
.

To
investigate
the
relationship
of
prostaglandins

(
PGs
)
to
seizure
induction
,
the
effects
of
six
PG
synthetase
inhibitors
on
convulsions
induced
by
flurothyl
,
picrotoxin
,
pentetrazol

(
PTZ
)
,
electroshock
or
bicuculline
were
evaluated
.

Ibuprofen
,
sulindac
,
mefenamic
acid
,
and
low
dose
meclofenamic
acid
increased
the
latency
-
to
-
onset
in
the
flurothyl
and/or
PTZ
models
;
the
electroshock
,
picrotoxin
and
bicuculline
models
were
not
significantly
affected
by
any
of
the
pretreatment
agents
.

These
results
suggest
that
PGs
are
involved

Angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitor
-
associated
angioedema
of
the
stomach
and
small
intestine
:
a
case
report
.

This
is
a
case
report
on
a
45-year
old
African
-
American
female
with
newly
diagnosed
hypertension
,
who
was
started
on
a
combination
pill
of
amlodipine
/
benazapril

10/5
mg
.

The
very
next
day
,
she
presented
at
the
emergency
room
(
ER
)
with
abdominal
pain
,
nausea
and
vomiting
.

Physical
exam
,
complete
metabolic
panel
,
and
hemogram
were
in
the
normal
range
.

She
was
discharged
from
the
ER
after
a
few
hours
of
treatment
with
fluid
and
analgesics
.

However
,
she
returned
to
the
ER
the
next
day
with
the
same
complaints
.

This
time
the
physical
exam
was
significant
for
a
distended
abdomen
with
dullness
to
percussion
.

CT
scan
of
the
abdomen
revealed
markedly
thickened
antrum
of
the
stomach
,
duodenum
and
jejunum
,
along
with
fluid
in
the
abdominal
and
pelvic
cavity
.

Angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
(
ACEI)-induced
angioedema
was
suspected
,
and
anti-
hypertensive
medications
were
discontinued
.

Her
symptoms
improved
within
the
next
24
hours
,
and
repeat
CT
after
72
hours
revealed
marked
improvement
in
stomach
and
small

Valproic
acid

I
:
time
course
of
lipid
peroxidation
biomarkers
,
liver
toxicity
,
and
valproic
acid
metabolite
levels
in
rats
.

A
single
dose
of
valproic
acid

(
VPA
)
,
which
is
a
widely
used
antiepileptic
drug
,
is
associated
with
oxidative
stress
in
rats
,
as
recently
demonstrated
by
elevated
levels
of
15-F(2t)-isoprostane

(
15-F(2t)-IsoP
)
.

To
determine
whether
there
was
a
temporal
relationship
between
VPA

-associated
oxidative
stress
and
hepatotoxicity
,
adult
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
treated
ip
with
VPA

(
500
mg
/
kg
)
or
0.9
%
saline
(
vehicle
)
once
daily
for
2
,
4
,
7
,
10
,
or
14
days
.

Oxidative
stress
was
assessed
by
determining
plasma
and
liver
levels
of
15-F(2t)-IsoP
,
lipid
hydroperoxides

(
LPO
)
,
and
thiobarbituric
acid
reactive
substances
(
TBARs
)
.

Plasma
and
liver
15-F(2t)-IsoP
were
elevated
and
reached
a
plateau
after
day
2
of
VPA
treatment
compared
to
control
.

Liver
LPO
levels
were
not
elevated
until
day
7
of
treatment
(
1.8-fold
versus
control
,
p
0.05
)
.

Liver
and
plasma
TBARs
were
not
increased
until
14
days
(
2-fold
vs.
control
,
p
0.05
)
.

Liver
toxicity
was
evaluated
based
on
serum
levels
of
alpha-
glutathione
S
-
transferase
(
alpha
-
GST
)
and
by
histology
.

Serum
alpha
-
GST
levels
were
significantly
elevated
by
day
4
,
which
corresponded
to
hepatotoxicity
as
shown
by
the
increasing
incidence
of
inflammation
of
the
liver
capsule
,
necrosis
,
and
steatosis
throughout
the
study
.

The
liver
levels
of
beta
-
oxidation
metabolites
of
VPA
were
decreased
by
day
14
,
while
the
levels
of
4-ene
-
VPA
and
(
E)-
2,4-diene
-
VPA
were
not
elevated
throughout
the
study
.

Overall
,
these
findings
indicate
that
VPA
treatment
results
in
oxidative
stress
,
as
measured
by
levels
of
15-F(2t)-IsoP
,
which
precedes
the
onset
of
necrosis
,
steatosis
,
and
elevated
levels
of
serum
alpha

Pheochromocytoma
unmasked
by
amisulpride
and
tiapride
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
the
unmasking
of
pheochromocytoma
in
a
patient
treated
with
amisulpride
and
tiapride
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
42-year
-
old
white
man
developed
acute
hypertension
with
severe
headache
and
vomiting
2
hours
after
the
first
doses
of
amisulpride

100
mg
and
tiapride
100
mg
.

Both
drugs
were
immediately
discontinued
,
and
the
patient
recovered
after
subsequent
nicardipine
and
verapamil
treatment
.

Abdominal
ultrasound
showed
an
adrenal
mass
,
and
postoperative
histologic
examination
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
pheochromocytoma
.

DISCUSSION
:

Drug
-
induced
symptoms
of
pheochromocytoma
are
often
associated
with
the
use
of
substituted
benzamide
drugs
,
but
the
underlying
mechanism
is
unknown
.

In
our
case
,
use
of
the
Naranjo
probability
scale
indicated
a
possible
relationship
between
the
hypertensive
crisis
and
amisulpride
and
tiapride
therapy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

As
of
March
24
,
2005
,
this
is
the
first
reported
case
of
amisulpride
-
and
tiapride
-induced
hypertensive
crisis
in
a
patient
with
pheochromocytoma
.

Physicians
and
other
healthcare
professionals
should
be
aware
of
this
potential
adverse
effect
of
tiapride
and
amisulpride
.

Quantitative
drug
levels
in
stimulant
psychosis
:
relationship
to
symptom
severity
,
catecholamines
and
hyperkinesia
.

To
examine
the
relationship
between
quantitative
stimulant
drug
levels
,
catecholamines
,
and
psychotic
symptoms
,
nineteen
patients
in
a
psychiatric
emergency
service
with
a
diagnosis
of
amphetamine
-
or
cocaine
-induced

psychosis
were
interviewed
,
and
plasma
and
urine
were
collected
for
quantitative
assays
of
stimulant
drug
and
catecholamine
metabolite
levels
.

Methamphetamine
or
amphetamine
levels
were
related
to
several
psychopathology
scores
and
the
global
hyperkinesia
rating
.

HVA
levels
were
related
to
global
hyperkinesia
but
not
to
psychopathology
ratings
.

Although
many
other
factors
such
as
sensitization
may
play
a
role
,
intensity
of
stimulant
-
induced
psychotic
symptoms
and
stereotypies
appears
to
be
at
least
in
part
dose
-
related
.

Delayed
asystolic

cardiac
arrest
after
diltiazem
overdose
;
resuscitation
with
high
dose
intravenous
calcium
.

A
51
year
old
man
took
a
mixed
overdose
including
1.8
-
3.6
g
of
diltiazem
,
paracetamol
,
aspirin
,
isosorbide
nitrate
,
and
alcohol
.

He
initially
presented
to
hospital
after
six
hours
with
mild
hypotension
and
was
treated
with
activated
charcoal
and
intravenous
fluids
.

Eighteen
hours
after
the
overdose

he
had
two
generalised
tonic
-
clonic
seizures
.

The
patient
remained
unresponsive
with
junctional
bradycardia
,
unrecordable
blood
pressure
,
and
then
became
asystolic
.

He
was
resuscitated
with
high
dose
(
13.5
g
)
intravenous
calcium
and
adrenaline

(
epinephrine
)
.

He
required
inotropic
support
and
temporary
pacing
over
the
next
48
hours
.

This
case
suggests
there
is
a
role
for
aggressive
high
dose
intravenous
calcium
therapy
in
severe
diltiazem

overdose
,
particularly
with
the
onset
of
asystole
.

It
should
be
considered
early
in
cases
of
cardiac
arrest
after
diltiazem
overdose
.

The
case
also
highlights
the
problems
with
delayed
toxicity

when
whole
bowel
irrigation
is
not
administered
.

Renal
papillary
necrosis
due
to
naproxen
.

A
31-year
-
old
man
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
who
had
previously
been
treated
with
sulindac
,
fenoprofen
calcium
,
high
dose
salicylates
and
gold
salts
,
developed
renal
papillary
necrosis

(
RPN
)
4
months
after
institution
of
naproxen
therapy
.

No
other
factor
predisposing
to
RPN
could
be
discovered
.

Sulindac
was
substituted
for
naproxen
and
no
further
adverse
renal
effects
occurred
over
the
next
12
months
.

We
review
previous
reports
linking
RPN
to
antiinflammatory
drug
use
and
discuss
possible
advantages
of
sulindac
in
patients
who
have
experienced
renal
toxicity
from
other
antiinflammatory
agents
.

Adverse
interaction
between
beta
-
adrenergic
blocking
drugs
and
verapamil
--report
of
three
cases
.

Three
patients
with
ischaemic
heart
disease
developed
profound
cardiac
failure
,
hypotension
and
bradycardia
during
combined
therapy
with
verapamil
and
beta
-
adrenergic
blocking
drugs
.

This
clinical
picture
resolved
completely
with
cessation
of
the
combined
therapy
.

Baseline
left
ventricular
function
,
assessed
by
cardiac
catheterisation
or
nuclear
angiography
,
was
normal
in
two
patients
and
only
mildly
reduced
in
the
other
.

Simultaneously
administration
of
beta
-
adrenergic
blocking
drugs
and
verapamil
may
result
in
profound
adverse
interactions
and
should
only
be
administered
with
great
caution
.

Adverse
reactions
to
bendrofluazide
and
propranolol
for
the
treatment
of
mild
hypertension
.

Report
of
Medical
Research
Council
Working
Party
on
Mild
to
Moderate
Hypertension
.

Participants
in
the
Medical
Research
Council
treatment
trial
for
mild
hypertension
are
randomly
allocated
to
one
of
four
treatment
groups
:
bendrofluazide
,
propranolol
,
or
a
placebo
for
either
of
these
drugs
.

The
trial
is
single
-
blind
.

23
582
patient
-
years
of
observation
have
been
completed
so
far
,
10
684
on
active
drugs
and
12
898
on
placebos
.

The
results
show
an
association
between
bendrofluazide
treatment
and
impotence
,
and
impotence
also
occurred
more
frequently
in
patients
taking
propranolol
than
in
those
taking
placebos
.

Other
adverse
reactions
significantly
linked
with
active
drugs
include
impaired
glucose
tolerance
in
men
and
women
and
gout
in
men
,
associated
with
bendrofluazide
treatment
,
and
Raynaud
's
phenomenon
and
dyspnoea
in
men
and
women
taking
propranolol
.

No
corneal
disease
is
known
to
have
occurred
in
the
propranolol
group
.

Mean
serum
potassium
level
fell
,
and
urea
and
uric
acid
levels
rose
,
in
men
and
women
taking
bendrofluazide
.

In
the
propranolol
group
,
serum

potassium
and
uric
acid
levels
rose
in
both
sexes
,
but
the
urea
level
rose
significantly
in
women
only
.

Dexmedetomidine

.

We
conducted
a
systematic

of
the
effects
of
dexmedetomidine
on
cardiac
outcomes
following
non

.

We
included
prospective
,
randomised
peri

studies
of
dexmedetomidine

that
reported
mortality
,
cardiac
morbidity
or
adverse
drug

.

A
PubMed

was
conducted
up
to
July

.

The

Differential
diagnosis
of
high
serum
creatine
kinase
levels
in
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
.

We
report
the
clinical
and
bioptic
findings
for
a
57-year
-
old
woman
with
severe
chloroquine
-induced
myopathy
.

Since
1989
,
she
had
been
suffering
from
systemic
lupus
erythematosus

(
SLE
)
with
renal
involvement
and
undergone
periods
of
treatment
with
azathioprine
and
cyclophosphamide
.

Additional
therapy
with
chloroquine

(
CQ
)
was
started
because
of
arthralgia
.

At
the
same
time
,
slightly
increased

creatine
kinase
(
CK
)
levels
were
noted
.

Myositis
was
suspected
,
and
the
patient
was
treated
with
steroids
.

The
CK
increase
persisted
,
however
,
and
she
developed
progressive
muscular
weakness
and
muscular
atrophy
.

Routine
controls
revealed
markedly
elevated
CK
levels
of
1,700
U
/
l
.

The
neurological
and
electrophysiological
findings
were
not
typical
of
myositis
.

Thus
,
muscle
biopsy
of
the
deltoid
muscle
was
performed
in
order
to
exclude
polymyositis
or
toxic
myopathy
.

As
it
revealed
chloroquine

-induced

myopathy
,
medication
was
stopped
.

Discriminating
between

Intravenous
ribavirin
treatment
for
severe
adenovirus
disease
in
immunocompromised
children
.

BACKGROUND
:

Adenovirus
is
an
important
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
the
immunocompromised
host
.

The
incidence
of
severe
adenovirus
disease
in
pediatrics
is
increasing
in
association
with
growing
numbers
of
immunocompromised
children
,
where
case
fatality
rates
as
high
as
50
%
to
80
%
have
been
reported
.

There
are
no
approved
antiviral
agents
with
proven
efficacy
for
the
treatment
of
severe
adenovirus
disease
,
nor
are
there
any
prospective
randomized
,
controlled
trials
of
potentially
useful
anti
-
adenovirus
therapies
.

Apparent
clinical
success
in
the
treatment
of
severe
adenovirus
disease
is
limited
to
a
few
case
reports
and
small
series
.

Experience
is
greatest
with
intravenous
ribavirin
and
cidofovir
.

Ribavirin
,
a
guanosine
analogue
,
has
broad
antiviral
activity
against
both
RNA
and
DNA
viruses
,
including
documented
activity
against
adenovirus
in
vitro
.

Ribavirin
is
licensed
in
aerosol
form
for
the
treatment
of
respiratory
syncytial
virus
infection
,
and
orally
in
combination
with
interferon
to
treat
hepatitis
C
.

Intravenous
ribavirin
is
the
treatment
of
choice
for
infection
with
hemorrhagic
fever
viruses
.

The
most
common
adverse
effect
of
intravenous
ribavirin
is
reversible
mild
anemia
.

The
use
of
cidofovir
in
severe
adenovirus
infection
has
been
limited
by
adverse
effects
,
the
most
significant
of
which
is
nephrotoxicity
.

OBJECTIVE
:

We
report
our
experience
with
intravenous
ribavirin
therapy
for
severe
adenovirus
disease
in
a
series
of
immunocompromised
children
and
review
the
literature
.

DESIGN
/
METHODS
:
We
retrospectively
reviewed
the
medical
records
of
5
children
treated
with
intravenous
ribavirin
for
documented
severe
adenovirus
disease
.

Two
patients
developed
adenovirus
hemorrhagic
cystitis
after
cardiac
and
bone
marrow
transplants
,
respectively
.

The
bone
marrow
transplant
patient
also
received
intravenous
cidofovir
for
progressive
disseminated
disease
.

An
additional
3
children
developed
adenovirus
pneumonia
;
2
were
neonates
,
1
of
whom
had
partial
DiGeorge
syndrome
.

The
remaining
infant
had
recently
undergone
a
cardiac
transplant
.

Intravenous
ribavirin
was
administered
on
a
compassionate
-
use
protocol
.

RESULTS
:

Complete
clinical
recovery
followed
later
by
viral
clearance
was
observed
in
2
children
:
the
cardiac
transplant
recipient
with
adenovirus
hemorrhagic
cystitis
and
the
immunocompetent
neonate
with
adenovirus
pneumonia
.

The
remaining
3
children
died
of
adenovirus
disease
.

Intravenous
ribavirin

therapy
was
well
tolerated
.

Use
of
cidofovir
in
1
child
was
associated
with
progressive
renal
failure
and
neutropenia
.

DISCUSSION
:

Our
series
of
patients
is
representative
of
the
spectrum
of
immunocompromised
children
at
greatest
risk
for
severe
adenovirus
disease
,
namely
solid
-
organ
and
bone
marrow
transplant
recipients
,
neonates
,
and
children
with
immunodeficiency
.

Although
intravenous
ribavirin
was
not
effective
for
all
children
with
severe
adenovirus
disease
in
this
series
or
in
the
literature
,
therapy
is
unlikely
to
be
of
benefit
if
begun
late
in
the
course
of
the
infection
.

Early
identification
,
eg
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
of
those
patients
at
risk
of
disseminated

adenovirus
disease
may
permit
earlier
antiviral
treatment
and
better
evaluation
of
therapeutic
response
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Two
of
5
children
with
severe
adenovirus
disease
treated
with
intravenous
ribavirin
recovered
.

The
availability
of
newer
rapid
diagnostic
techniques
,
such
as
polymerase
chain
reaction
,
may
make
earlier
,
more
effective
treatment
of
adenovirus
infection
possible
.

Given
the
seriousness
and
increasing
prevalence
of
adenovirus
disease
in
certain
hosts
,
especially
children
,
a
large
,
multicenter
clinical
trial
of
potentially
useful
anti
-
adenoviral
therapies
,
such
as
intravenous
ribavirin
,
is
clearly
required
to
demonstrate
the
most
effective
and
least
toxic
therapy
.

Hepatotoxicity
of
amiodarone
.

Amiodarone
has
proved
very
effective
in
the
treatment
of
otherwise
resistant
cardiac
tachyarrhythmias
.

The
use
of
amiodarone
has
,
however
,
been
limited
due
to
its
serious
side
-
effects
.

A
patient
with
cholestatic
hepatitis
due
to
amiodarone
treatment
is
presented
below
and
a
review
of
the
hepatotoxicity
of
amiodarone
is
given
.

It
is
concluded
that
solid
evidence
exists
of
hepatic
injury
due
to
amiodarone
treatment
,
including
steatosis
,
alterations
resembling
alcoholic
hepatitis
,
cholestatic
hepatitis
and
micronodular
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
.

Patients
receiving
amiodarone
should
be
regularly
screened
with
respect
to
hepatic
enzyme
levels
.

Therapy
should
be
discontinued
on
the
suspicion
of
cholestatic
injury
or
hepatomegaly
.

Catalepsy
induced
by
combinations
of
ketamine
and
morphine
:
potentiation
,
antagonism
,
tolerance
and
cross
-
tolerance
in
the
rat
.

Previous
studies
demonstrated
that
both
ketamine
and
morphine
induced
analgesia
and
catalepsy
in
the
rat
.

Pre
-
treatment
with
ketamine
produced
cross
-
tolerance
to
morphine
,
whereas
pretreatment
with
morphine
did
not
induce
cross
-
tolerance
to
ketamine
but
rather
augmented
the
cataleptic
response
;
this
augmentation
was
attributed
to
residual
morphine
in
the
brain
.

The
present
studies
explored
the
duration
of
the
loss
of
righting
reflex
induced
by
sub
-
effective
doses
of
ketamine
and
morphine
,
administered
simultaneously
.

There
was
mutual
potentiation
between
sub
-
effective
doses
of
ketamine
and
morphine
,
but
sub
-
effective
doses
of
ketamine
partly
antagonized
fully
-
effective
doses
of
morphine
.

Latency
to
the
loss
of
righting
reflex
,
rigidity
and
behavior
on
recovery
,
reflected
the
relative
predominance
of
ketamine
or
morphine
in
each
combination
.

Naloxone
inhibited
the
induced
cataleptic
effects
.

The
degree
and
time
course
of
development
of
tolerance
to
daily
administration
of
sub
-
effective
dose
combinations
of
ketamine
and
morphine
were
similar
.

Rats
,
tolerant
to
ketamine
-dominant
combinations
,
were
cross
-
tolerant
to
both
drugs
,
while
those
tolerant
to

morphine
-dominant
combinations
were
cross
-
tolerant
to
morphine
but
showed
either
no
cross
-
tolerance
or
an
augmented
response
to
ketamine
.

While
the
mutual
potentiation
,
antagonism
and
tolerance
suggest
common
mechanisms
for
the
induced
catalepsy
,
differences
in
latency
,
rigidity
and
behavior
,
asymmetry
of
cross
-
tolerance
and
a
widely
-
different
ID50
for

naloxone
would
argue
against
an
action
at
a
single
opioid
site
.

Acute
renal
failure
in
patients
with
AIDS
on
tenofovir
while
receiving
prolonged
vancomycin
course
for
osteomyelitis
.

Renal
failure
developed
after
a
prolonged
course
of
vancomycin
therapy
in
2
patients
who
were
receiving
tenofovir
disoproxil
fumarate
as
part
of
an
antiretroviral
regimen
.

Tenofovir
has
been
implicated
in
the
development
of
Fanconi
syndrome
and
renal
insufficiency
because
of
its
effects
on
the
proximal
renal
tubule
.

Vancomycin

nephrotoxicity
is
infrequent
but
may
result
from
coadministration
with
a
nephrotoxic
agent
.

Clinicians
should
be
aware
that
tenofovir
may
raise
the
risk
of
renal
failure
during
prolonged
administration
of
vancomycin
.

Delayed
leukoencephalopathy
with

stroke
-like
presentation
in
chemotherapy
recipients
.

BACKGROUND
:

A
transient
leukoencephalopathy
mimicking

cerebrovascular
accident
has
been
described
as
a
complication
of
chemotherapy
,
most
commonly
in
recipients
of
intrathecal
methotrexate
for
childhood
leukaemia
.

Recently
published
neuroimaging
data
suggest
a
common
pathophysiology
associated
with
a
variety
of
chemotherapy
agents
and
modes
of
administration
.

METHODS
:

We
reviewed
the
medical
literature
for
single
reports
and
case
series
of
patients
presenting
with

stroke
-like
episodes
while
receiving
systemic
or
intrathecal
chemotherapy
.

We
only
included
studies
providing
detailed
neuroimaging
data
.

Patients
with
cerebrovascular
accidents
were
excluded
.

RESULTS
:

We
identified
27
reports
of
toxic
leukoencephalopathy
in
patients
treated
with
methotrexate
(
intrathecal
,
systemic
)
,
5-fluorouracil
and
its
derivative
carmofur
,
and
capecitabine
.

Diffusion
weighted
imaging
(
DWI
)
of
all
patients
revealed
well
demarcated
hyperintense
lesions
within
the
subcortical
white
matter
of
the
cerebral
hemispheres
and
the
corpus
callosum
,
corresponding
to
areas
of
decreased
proton
diffusion
on
apparent
diffusion
coefficient
(
ADC
)
maps
(
available
in
21/27
patients
)
.

Lesions
exceeded
the
confines
of
adjacent
vascular
territories
.

Complete
resolution
of
symptoms
within
1
-
4
days
was
accompanied
by
normalisation
of
ADC
abnormalities
.

However
,
fluid
attenuated
inversion
recovery
(
FLAIR
)
sequences
frequently
revealed
persistent
white
matter
abnormalities
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Several
pathophysiological
models
of
delayed
leukoencephalopathy
after
exposure
to
intrathecal
or
systemic
chemotherapy
have
been
proposed
.

DWI
findings
in
this
cohort
are
indicative
of
cytotoxic
oedema
within
cerebral
white
matter
and
lend
support
to
an
at
least
partially
reversible
metabolic
derangement
as
the
basis
for
this
syndrome
.

Down
-
regulation
of
norepinephrine
transporter
function
induced
by
chronic
administration
of
desipramine
linking
to
the
alteration
of
sensitivity
of
local
-
anesthetics
-
induced
convulsions
and
the
counteraction
by
co
-
administration
with
local
anesthetics
.

Alterations
of
norepinephrine
transporter
(
NET
)
function
by
chronic
inhibition
of
NET
in
relation
to
sensitization
to

seizures
induce
by
cocaine
and
local
anesthetics
were
studied
in
mice
.

Daily
administration
of
desipramine
,
an
inhibitor
of
the
NET
,
for
5
days
decreased
[
(
3)H
]
norepinephrine
uptake
in
the
P2
fractions
of
hippocampus
but
not
cortex
,
striatum
or
amygdalae
.

Co
-
administration
of
lidocaine
,
bupivacaine
or
tricaine
with
desipramine
reversed
this
effect
.

Daily
treatment
of
cocaine
increased
[
(
3)H
]
norepinephrine
uptake
into
the
hippocampus
.

Daily
administration
of
desipramine
increased
the
incidence
of
appearance
of
lidocaine
-induced

convulsions
and
decreased
that
of
cocaine

-induced

convulsions

.
Co
-
administration
of
lidocaine
with
desipramine
reversed
the
changes
of
convulsive
activity
of
lidocaine
and
cocaine
induced
by
repeated
administration
of
desipramine
.

These
results
suggest
that
down
-
regulation
of
hippocampal
NET
induced
by
chronic
administration
of
desipramine
may
be
relevant
to
desipramine
-induced
sensitization
of
lidocaine
convulsions
.

Inhibition
of
Na
(
+
)
channels
by
local
anesthetics
may
regulate
desipramine
-induced
down
-
regulation
of
NET
function
.

Repeated
administration
of
cocaine
induces
up
-
regulation
of
hippocampal
NET
function
.

Desipramine

-induced
sensitization
of
lidocaine

seizures
may
have
a
mechanism
distinct
from
kindling
resulting
from
repeated
administration
of
cocaine
.

Definition
and
management
of
anemia
in
patients
infected
with
hepatitis
C
virus
.

Chronic
infection
with
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
can
progress
to
cirrhosis
,
hepatocellular
carcinoma
,
and
end
-
stage
liver
disease
.

The
current
best
treatment
for
HCV
infection
is
combination
therapy
with
pegylated
interferon
and
ribavirin
.

Although
this
regimen
produces
sustained
virologic
responses
(
SVRs
)
in
approximately
50
%
of
patients
,
it
can
be
associated
with
a
potentially
dose
-
limiting
hemolytic
anemia
.

Hemoglobin
concentrations
decrease
mainly
as
a
result
of
ribavirin

-induced

hemolysis
,
and
this
anemia
can
be
problematic
in
patients
with
HCV
infection
,
especially
those
who
have
comorbid
renal
or
cardiovascular
disorders
.

In
general
,
anemia
can
increase
the
risk
of
morbidity
and
mortality
,
and
may
have
negative
effects
on
cerebral
function
and
quality
of
life
.

Although
ribavirin
-associated
anemia
can
be
reversed
by
dose
reduction
or
discontinuation
,
this
approach
compromises
outcomes
by
significantly
decreasing
SVR
rates
.

Recombinant
human
erythropoietin
has
been
used
to
manage
ribavirin

-associated

anemia
but
has
other
potential
disadvantages
.

Viramidine
,
a
liver
-
targeting
prodrug
of
ribavirin
,
has
the
potential
to
maintain
the
virologic
efficacy
of
ribavirin
while
decreasing
the
risk
of
hemolytic
anemia
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
.

Calcium
carbonate

toxicity
:
the
updated
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
;
report
of
3
cases
and
review
of
the
literature
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
3
patients
with
calcium
carbonate
-induced
hypercalcemia
and
gain
insights
into
the
cause
and
management
of
the
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
.

METHODS
:

We
report
the
clinical
and
laboratory
data
in
3
patients
who
presented
with
severe
hypercalcemia
(
corrected
serum
calcium
>
or
=
14
mg
/
dL
)
and
review
the
pertinent
literature
on
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
.

RESULTS
:

The
3
patients
had
acute
renal
insufficiency
,
relative
metabolic
alkalosis
,
and
low
parathyroid
hormone
(
PTH
)
,
PTH
-
related
peptide
,
and
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D
concentrations
.

No
malignant
lesion
was
found
.

Treatment
included
aggressive
hydration
and
varied
amounts
of
furosemide
.

The
2
patients
with
the
higher
serum

calcium
concentrations
received
pamidronate
intravenously
(
60
and
30
mg
,
respectively
)
,
which
caused
severe
hypocalcemia
.

Of
the
3
patients
,
2
were
ingesting
acceptable
doses
of
elemental
calcium
(
1
g
and
2
g
daily
,
respectively
)
in
the
form
of
calcium
carbonate
.

In
addition
to
our
highlighted
cases
,
we
review
the
history
,
classification
,
pathophysiologic
features
,
and
treatment
of
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
and
summarize
the
cases
reported
from
early
1995
to
November
2003
.

CONCLUSION
:

Milk
-
alkali
syndrome
may
be
a
common
cause
of
unexplained
hypercalcemia
and
can
be
precipitated
by
small
amounts
of
orally
ingested
calcium
carbonate
in
susceptible
persons
.

Treatment
with
hydration
,
furosemide
,
and
discontinuation
of
the
calcium
and
vitamin
D
source
is
adequate
.

Pamidronate
treatment
is
associated
with
considerable
risk
for
hypocalcemia
,
even
in
cases
of
initially
severe
hypercalcemia
.

Management
strategies
for
ribavirin
-induced
hemolytic
anemia
in
the
treatment
of
hepatitis
C
:
clinical
and
economic
implications
.

OBJECTIVES
:

Recently
published
studies
have
demonstrated
increased
efficacy
and
cost
-
effectiveness
of
combination
therapy
with
interferon
and
alpha-2b/
ribavirin
compared
with
interferon
-
alpha
monotherapy
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
hepatitis
C

(
CHC
)
.

Combination
therapy
is
associated
with
a
clinically
important
adverse
effect
:
ribavirin
-induced
hemolytic
anemia

(
RIHA
)
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
direct
health
-
care
costs
and
management
of
RIHA
during
treatment
of
CHC
in
a
clinical
trial
setting
.

METHODS
:

A
systematic
literature
review
was
conducted
to
synthesize
information
on
the
incidence
and
management
of
RIHA
.

Decision
-
analytic
techniques
were
used
to
estimate
the
cost
of
treating
RIHA
.

Uncertainty
was
evaluated
using
sensitivity
analyses
.

RESULTS
:

RIHA
,
defined
as
a
reduction
in
hemoglobin
to
less
than
100
g
/
L
,
occurs
in
approximately
7
%
to
9
%
of
patients
treated
with
combination
therapy
.

The
standard
of
care
for
management
of
RIHA
is
reduction
or
discontinuation
of
the
ribavirin
dosage
.

We
estimated
the
direct
cost
of
treating
clinically
significant
RIHA
to
be
170
per
patient
receiving
combination
therapy
per
48-week
treatment
course
(
range
68-
692
)
.

The
results
of
the
one
-
way
sensitivity
analyses
ranged
from
57
to
317
.

In
comparison
,
the
cost
of
48
weeks
of
combination
therapy
is
16,459
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
direct
cost
of
treating
clinically
significant
RIHA
is
1
%
(
170/
16,459
)
of
drug
treatment
costs
.

Questions
remain
about
the
optimal
dose
of
ribavirin
and
the
incidence
of
RIHA
in
a
real
-
world
population
.

Despite
these
uncertainties
,
this
initial
evaluation
of
the
direct
cost
of
treating
RIHA
provides
an
estimate
of
the
cost
and
management
implications
of
this
clinically
important
adverse
effect
.

Effects
of
amine
pretreatment
on
ketamine
catatonia
in
pinealectomized
or
hypophysectomized
animals
.

The
present
studies
were
designed
to
clarify
the
role
of
catecholamines
and
pineal
idolamines
on
ketamine
-induced
catatonia
in
the
intact
,
pinealectomized
or
hypophysectomized
chick
and
rat
.

In
the
pinealectomized
chick
,
pretreatment
with
dopamine
increased
the
duration
of
catatonia

(
DOC
)
after
ketamine
,
but
pretreatment
with
norepinephrine
did
not
.

The
pineal
indolamines
exhibited
mixed
actions
.

Serotonin
and
N
-
acetyl
serotonin
which
augmented
ketamine
DOC
,
did
not
do
so
in
the
absence
of
the
pineal
gland
,
whereas
melatonin
potentiated
the
ketamine
DOC
in
both
the
intact
and
pinealectomized
chick
.

Ketamine
was
more
potent
in
the
hypophysectomized
chick
and
the
circadian
rhythm
noted
in
the
intact
chick
was
absent
;
furthermore
,
melatonin
did
not
augment
the
ketamine
DOC
whereas
dopamine
continued
to
do
so
.

This
study
did
not
demonstrate
a
species
difference
regarding
the
role
of
the
amines
on
the
pineal
in
spite
of
the
immature
blood
-
brain
barrier
in
the
young
chick
and
the
intact
barrier
in
the
rat
.

In
addition
,
these
data
indicate
a
direct
role
of
the
pituitary
in
the
augmentation
of
ketamine
DOC
induced
by
melatonin
.

Furthermore
,
dopamine
appeared
to
act
on
systems
more
closely
involved
with
the
induction
of
ketamine
catatonia
rather
than
directly
on
the
pituitary
.

.

Subjects
ranged
in
age
from
18
to
60
years
of
age
and
had
at
least
a
2-year
history
of
spring
allergic
rhinitis
,
confirmed
by
positive
skin
test
to
spring
aeroallergens
.

Medications
were
given
four
times
daily
;
the
azelastine
groups
received
0.5
,
1.0
,
or
2.0
mg
in
the
morning
and
evening
with
placebo
in
the
early
and
late
afternoon
;
the
chlorpheniramine
group
received
4.0
mg
four
times
daily
.

Daily
subject
symptom
cards
were
completed
during
a
screening
period
to
assess
pretreatment
symptoms
and
during
a
4-week
treatment
period
while
subjects
received
study
medications
.

Individual
symptoms
,
total
symptoms
,
and
major
symptoms
were
compared
to
determine
efficacy
of
medication
.

Elicited
,
volunteered
,
and
observed
adverse
experiences
were
recorded
for
each
subject
and
compared
among
groups
.

Vital
signs
,
body

,
serum
chemistry
values
,
complete
blood
cell
counts
,
urine
studies
,
and
electrocardiograms
were
obtained
for
each
subject
and
compared
among
groups
.

Symptoms
relief
in
the
group
receiving
the
highest
concentration
of
azelastine

(
2.0
mg
twice
daily
)
was
statistically
greater
than
in
the
placebo
group
during
all
weeks
of
the
study
.

Lower
doses
of
azelastine
were
statistically
more
effective
than
placebo
only
during
portions
of
the
first
3
weeks
of
the
study
.

In
contrast
,
although
the
chlorpheniramine
group
did
have
fewer
symptoms
than
the
placebo
group
during
the
study
,
the
difference
never
reached
statistical
significance
during
any
week
of
the
study
.

There
were
no
serious
side
effects
in
any
of
the
treatment
groups
.

Drowsiness
and
altered
taste
perception
were
increased
significantly
over
placebo
only
in
the
high

dose
azelastine

Obsolete
but
dangerous
antacid
preparations
.

One
case
of
acute
hypercalcaemia
and
two
of
recurrent
nephrolithiasis
are
reported
in
patients
who
had
regularly
consumed
large
amounts
of
calcium
carbon
-
ate
-
sodium
bicarbonate
powders
for
more
than
20
years
.

The
powders
had
been
obtained
from
pharmacists
unknown
to
the
patients
'
medical
practitioners
.

It
is
suggested
that
these
preparations
were
responsible
for
the
patient
's
problems
,
and
that
such
powders
should
no
longer
be
freely
obtainable
.

Prolonged
paralysis
due
to
nondepolarizing
neuromuscular
blocking
agents
and
corticosteroids
.

The
long
-
term
use
of
nondepolarizing
neuromuscular
blocking
agents

(
ND
-
NMBA
)
has
recently
been
implicated
as
a
cause
of
prolonged
muscle
weakness
,
although
the
site
of
the
lesion
and
the
predisposing
factors
have
been
unclear
.

We
report
3
patients
(
age
37
-
52
years
)
with
acute
respiratory
insufficiency
who
developed
prolonged
weakness
following
the
discontinuation
of
ND
-
NMBAs
.

Two
patients
also
received
intravenous
corticosteroids
.

Renal
function
was
normal
but
hepatic
function
was
impaired
in
all
patients
,
and
all
had
acidosis
.

Electrophysiologic
studies
revealed
low
amplitude
compound
motor
action
potentials
,
normal
sensory
studies
,
and
fibrillations
.

Repetitive
stimulation
at
2
Hz
showed
a
decremental
response
in
2
patients
.

The
serum
vecuronium
level
measured
in
1
patient
14
days
after
the
drug
had
been
discontinued
was
172
ng
/
mL.
A
muscle
biopsy
in
this
patient
showed
loss
of
thick
,
myosin
filaments
.

The
weakness
in
these
patients
is
due
to
pathology
at
both
the
neuromuscular
junction

(
most
likely
due
to
ND
-
NMBA
)
and
muscle
(
most
likely
due
to

Hepatic

Prostaglandin
E2
-induced
bladder
hyperactivity
in
normal
,
conscious
rats
:
involvement
of
tachykinins
?

In
normal
conscious
rats
investigated
by
continuous
cystometry
,
intravesically
instilled
prostaglandin
(
PG
)
E2

facilitated
micturition
and
increased
basal
intravesical
pressure
.

The
effect
was
attenuated
by
both
the
NK1
receptor
selective
antagonist
RP
67,580
and
the
NK2
receptor
selective
antagonist
SR
48,968
,
given
intra
-
arterially
,
suggesting
that
it
was
mediated
by
stimulation
of
both
NK1
and
NK2
receptors
.

Intra
-

arterially
given
PGE2
produced
a
distinct
increase
in
bladder
pressure
before
initiating
a
micturition
reflex
,
indicating
that
the
PG
had
a
direct
contractant
effect
on
the
detrusor
smooth
muscle
.

The
effect
of
intra
-
arterial
PGE2
could
not
be
blocked
by
intra
-
arterial
RP
67,580
or
SR
48,968
,
which
opens
the
possibility
that
the
micturition
reflex
elicited
by
intra
-
arterial
PGE2
was
mediated
by
pathways
other
than
the
reflex
initiated
when
the
PG
was
given
intravesically
.

The
present
results
thus
suggest
that
intra
-
arterial
PGE2
,
given
near
the
bladder
,
may
initiate
micturition
in
the
normal
rat
chiefly
by
directly
contracting
the
smooth
muscle
of
the
detrusor
.

However
,
when
given
intravesically
,
PGE2
may
stimulate
micturition
by
releasing
tachykinins
from
nerves
in
and/or
immediately
below
the
urothelium
.

These
tachykinins
,
in
turn
,
initiate
a
micturition
reflex
by
stimulating
NK1
and
NK2
receptors
.

Prostanoids
may
,
via
release
of
tachykinins
,
contribute
to
both
urge
and
bladder
hyperactivity
seen
in
inflammatory
conditions
of
the
lower
urinary
tract
.

Thiazide
diuretics
,
hypokalemia
and
cardiac
arrhythmias
.

Thiazide
diuretics
are
widely
accepted
as
the
cornerstone
of
antihypertensive
treatment
programs
.

Hypokalemia
is
a
commonly
encountered
metabolic
consequence
of
chronic
thiazide
therapy
.

We
treated
38
patients
(
22
low
renin
,
16
normal
renin
)
with
moderate
diastolic
hypertension
with
hydrochlorothiazide

(
HCTC
)
administered
on
a
twice
daily
schedule
.

Initial
dose
was
50
mg
and
the
dose
was
increased
at
monthly
intervals
to
100
mg
,
150
mg
and
200
mg
daily
until
blood
pressure
normalized
.

The
serum

during
the
control
period
was
4.5

respectively
.

Corresponding

and
3269

,
respectively
.

In
13
patients
we
observed
the
effects
of
HCTZ
therapy
(
100
mg
daily
)
on
the
occurrence
of
PVC
's
during
rest
as
well
as
during
static
and
dynamic
exercise
.

During
rest
we
observed
0.6

PVC
beats

SEM
and
during
static
and
dynamic
exercise
0.6

and
0.8

respectively
.

Corresponding
figures
during
HCTZ
therapy

were
1.4

0.1
,
3.6
+
/-
0.7
and
5.7

,
respectively
.

The
occurrence
of
PVC
's
correlated
significantly
with
the
fall
in
serum

K
+
observed
r
=
0.72
,
p
less
than
0.001
.

In
conclusion
we
found
that
thiazide

diuretics
cause

hypokalemia
and
depletion
of
body
potassium
.

The
more
profound
hypokalemia
,
the
greater
the
propensity
for
the
occurrence
of
PVC
's
.

Diuretics
,
potassium
and
arrhythmias
in
hypertensive

coronary
disease
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
modest
changes
in
plasma
potassium
can
alter
the
tendency
towards
cardiac
arrhythmias
.

If
this
were
so
,
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
might
be
especially
susceptible
.

Thus
,
myocardial
electrical
excitability
was
measured
in
patients
with
mild
essential
hypertension
and
known
coronary
artery
disease
after
8
weeks
of
treatment
with
a
potassium
-conserving
diuretic
(
amiloride
)
and
a
similar
period
on
a
potassium
-losing
diuretic
(
chlorthalidone
)
in
a
randomised
study
.

Plasma
potassium
concentrations
were
on
average
1
mmol
/
L
lower
during
the
chlorthalidone
phase
compared
to
amiloride
therapy
.

Blood
pressure
and
volume
states
as
assessed
by
bodyweight
,
plasma
renin
and
noradrenaline
(
norepinephrine
)
concentrations
were
similar
on
the
2
regimens
.

Compared
to
amiloride
treatment
,
the
chlorthalidone
phase
was
associated
with
an
increased
frequency
of
ventricular
ectopic
beats

(
24-hour
Holter
monitoring
)
and
a
higher
Lown
grading
,
increased
upslope
and
duration
of
the
monophasic
action
potential
,
prolonged
ventricular
effective
refractory
period
,
and
increased
electrical
instability
during
programmed
ventricular
stimulation
.

The
above
results
indicate
that
because
potassium
-losing
diuretic
therapy
can
increase
myocardial
electrical
excitability
in
patients
with
ischaemic
heart
disease
,
even
minor
falls
in
plasma
potassium

concentrations
are
probably
best
avoided
in
such
patients
.

GABA
involvement
in
naloxone
induced
reversal
of
respiratory
paralysis
produced
by
thiopental
.

No
agent
is
yet
available
to
reverse
respiratory
paralysis
produced
by
CNS
depressants
,
such
as
general
anesthetics
.

In
this
study
naloxone
reversed

respiratory
paralysis
induced
by
thiopental
in
rats
.

25
mg
/
kg
,
i.v
.

thiopental
produced
anesthesia
without
altering
respiratory
rate
,
increased

GABA
,
decreased

glutamate
,
and
had
no
effect
on
aspartate
or
glycine
levels
compared
to
controls
in
rat
cortex
and
brain
stem
.

Pretreatment
of
rats
with
thiosemicarbazide
for
30
minutes
abolished
the
anesthetic
action
as
well
as
the
respiratory
depressant
action
of
thiopental
.

50
mg
/
kg
,
i.v
.

thiopental
produced

respiratory
arrest
with
further
increase
in
GABA
and
decrease
in
glutamate
again
in
cortex
and
brain
stem
without
affecting
any
of
the
amino
acids
studied
in
four
regions
of
rat
brain
.

Naloxone
(
2.5
mg
/
kg
,
i.v
.
)
reversed
respiratory
paralysis
,
glutamate
and
GABA
levels
to
control
values
in
brain
stem
and
cortex
with
no
changes
in
caudate
or

.

These
data
suggest
naloxone
reverses

respiratory
paralysis
produced
by
thiopental
and
involves

GABA
in
its
action
.

National

on
the
prevention
of

B
virus
in
Japan

In
Japan
,
a
nationwide
prevention
program
against
mother
-
to
-
infant
infection
by
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
started
in
1985
.

This
program
consists
of
double
screenings
of
pregnant
women
and
prophylactic
treatment
to
the
infants
born
to
both
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen

(
HBsAg
)
and
hepatitis
B
e
antigen

(
HBeAg
)
positive
mothers
.

These
infants
are
treated
with
two
injections
of
hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
(
HBIG
)
and
at
least
three
injections
of
plasma
derived
hepatitis
B
vaccine
.

We
sent
questionnaires
about
the
numbers
of
each
procedure
or
examination
during
nine
months
of
investigation
period
to
each
local
government
in
1986
and
1987
.

93.4
%
pregnant
women
had
the
chance
to
be
examined
for
HBsAg
,
and
the
positive
rate
was
1.4
to
1.5
%
.

The
HBeAg
positive
rate
in
HBsAg
positive
was
23
to
26
%
.

The
HBsAg
positive
rate
in
neonates
and
in
infants
before
two
months
were
3
%
and
2
%
respectively
.

Some
problems
may
arise
,
because
27
to
30
%
of
infants
need
the
fourth
vaccination
in
some
restricted
areas
.

Nociceptive
effects
induced
by
intrathecal
administration
of
prostaglandin
D2
,
E2
,
or
F2
alpha
to
conscious
mice
.

The
effects
of
intrathecal
administration
of
prostaglandins
on
pain
responses
in
conscious
mice
were
evaluated
by
using
hot
plate
and
acetic
acid
writhing
tests
.

Prostaglandin
D2
(
0.5
-
3
ng
/
mouse
)
had
a
hyperalgesic
action
on
the
response
to
a
hot
plate
during
a
3
-
60
min
period
after
injection
.

Prostaglandin
E2
showed
a
hyperalgesic
effect
at
doses
of
1
pg
to
10
ng
/
mouse
,
but
the
effect
lasted
shorter
(
3
-
30
min
)
than
that
of
prostaglandin
D2
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
by
acetic
acid

writhing
tests
.

The
hyperalgesic
effect
of
prostaglandin
D2
was
blocked
by
simultaneous
injection
of
a
substance
P
antagonist
(
greater
than
or
equal
to
100
ng
)
but
not
by
AH6809
,
a
prostanoid
EP1-receptor
antagonist
.

Conversely
,
prostaglandin
E2
-induced

hyperalgesia
was
blocked
by
AH6809
(
greater
than
or
equal
to
500
ng
)
but
not
by
the
substance
P
antagonist
.

Prostaglandin
F2
alpha
had
little
effect
on
pain
responses
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
both
prostaglandin
D2
and
prostaglandin
E2
exert
hyperalgesia
in
the
spinal
cord
,
but
in
different
ways
.

Swallowing
-
induced
atrial
tachyarrhythmia
triggered
by
salbutamol
:
case
report
and
review
of
the
literature
.

CASE
:

A
49-year
-
old
patient
experienced
chest
discomfort
while
swallowing
.

On
electrocardiogram
,
episodes
of
atrial
tachyarrhythmia
were
recorded
immediately
after
swallowing
;
24-hour
Holter
monitoring
recorded
several
events
.

The
arrhythmia
resolved
after
therapy
with
atenolol
,
but
recurred
a
year
later
.

The
patient
noticed
that
before
these
episodes
he
had
been
using
an
inhalator
of
salbutamol
.

After
stopping
the
beta
-
agonist
,
and
after
a
week
with
the
atenolol
,
the
arrhythmia
disappeared
.

DISCUSSION
:

Swallowing
-
induced
atrial
tachyarrhythmia

(
SIAT
)
is
a
rare
phenomenon
.

Fewer
than
50
cases
of
SIAT
have
been
described
in
the
literature
.

This
article
summarizes
all
the
cases
published
,
creating
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
current
knowledge
and
approach
to
SIAT
.

It
discusses
demographics
,
clinical
characteristics
and
types
of
arrhythmia
,
postulated
mechanisms
of
SIAT
,
and
different
treatment
possibilities
such
as
medications
,
surgery
,
and
radiofrequency
catheter
ablation
(
RFCA
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

Salbutamol
is
presented
here
as
a
possible
trigger
for
SIAT
.

Although
it
is
difficult
to
define
causality
in
a
case
report
,
it
is
logical
to
think
that
a
beta
-
agonist
like
salbutamol
(
known
to
induce
tachycardia
)
may
be
the
trigger
of
adrenergic
reflexes
originating
in
the
esophagus
while
swallowing
and
that
a
beta
-
blocker
such
as
atenolol

(
that
blocks
the
adrenergic
activity
)
may
relieve
it
.

Coenzyme
Q10
treatment
ameliorates
acute
cisplatin
nephrotoxicity
in
mice
.

The
nephroprotective
effect
of
coenzyme
Q10
was
investigated
in
mice
with
acute
renal
injury
induced
by
a
single
i.p
.

injection
of
cisplatin

(
5
mg
/
kg
)
.

Coenzyme
Q10
treatment
(
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
,
i.p
.
)
was
applied
for
6
consecutive
days
,
starting
1
day
before
cisplatin
administration
.

Coenzyme
Q10
significantly
reduced

blood
urea
nitrogen
and
serum
creatinine
levels
which
were
increased
by
cisplatin
.

Coenzyme
Q10
significantly
compensated
deficits
in
the
antioxidant
defense
mechanisms
(
reduced
glutathione
level
and
superoxide
dismutase
activity
)
,
suppressed
lipid
peroxidation
,
decreased
the
elevations
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
,
nitric
oxide
and
platinum
ion
concentration
,
and
attenuated
the
reductions
of
selenium
and
zinc
ions
in
renal
tissue
resulted
from
cisplatin
administration
.

Also
,
histopathological
renal
tissue
damage
mediated
by
cisplatin
was
ameliorated
by
coenzyme
Q10
treatment
.

Immunohistochemical
analysis
revealed
that
coenzyme
Q10
significantly
decreased
the
cisplatin
-induced
overexpression
of
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
,
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
,
caspase-3
and
p53
in
renal
tissue
.

It
was
concluded
that
coenzyme
Q10
represents
a
potential
therapeutic
option
to
protect
against
acute
cisplatin
nephrotoxicity
commonly
encountered
in
clinical
practice
.

Metformin
prevents

experimental
gentamicin
-induced

nephropathy
by
a
mitochondria
-
dependent
pathway
.

The
antidiabetic
drug
metformin
can
diminish
apoptosis
induced
by
oxidative
stress
in
endothelial
cells
and
prevent
vascular
dysfunction
even
in
nondiabetic
patients
.

Here
we
tested
whether
it
has
a
beneficial
effect
in
a
rat
model
of
gentamicin
toxicity
.

Mitochondrial
analysis
,
respiration
intensity
,
levels
of
reactive
oxygen
species
,
permeability
transition
,
and
cytochrome
c
release
were
assessed
3
and
6
days
after
gentamicin
administration
.

Metformin
treatment
fully
blocked

gentamicin
-mediated
acute
renal
failure
.

This
was
accompanied
by
a
lower
activity
of
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
D
-
glucosaminidase
,
together
with
a
decrease
of
lipid
peroxidation
and
increase
of
antioxidant
systems
.

Metformin
also
protected
the
kidney
from
histological
damage
6
days
after
gentamicin
administration
.

These
in
vivo
markers
of
kidney
dysfunction
and
their
correction
by
metformin
were
complemented
by
in
vitro
studies
of
mitochondrial
function
.

We
found
that
gentamicin
treatment
depleted
respiratory
components
(
cytochrome
c
,
NADH
)
,
probably
due
to
the
opening
of
mitochondrial
transition
pores
.

These
injuries
,
partly
mediated
by
a
rise
in
reactive
oxygen
species
from
the
electron
transfer
chain
,
were
significantly
decreased
by
metformin
.

Thus
,
our
study
suggests
that
pleiotropic
effects
of
metformin
can
lessen
gentamicin
nephrotoxicity
and
improve
mitochondrial
homeostasis
.

Sedation
depth
during
spinal
anesthesia
and
the
development
of
postoperative
delirium
in
elderly
patients
undergoing
hip
fracture
repair
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
determine
whether
limiting
intraoperative
sedation
depth
during
spinal
anesthesia
for
hip
fracture
repair
in
elderly
patients
can
decrease
the
prevalence
of
postoperative
delirium
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

We
performed
a
double
-
blind
,
randomized
controlled
trial
at
an
academic
medical
center
of
elderly
patients
(
>
or=65
years
)
without
preoperative
delirium
or
severe
dementia
who
underwent
hip
fracture
repair
under
spinal
anesthesia
with
propofol
sedation
.

Sedation
depth
was
titrated
using
processed
electroencephalography
with
the
bispectral
index
(
BIS
)
,
and
patients
were
randomized
to
receive
either
deep

BIS
,
approximately
50
)
or
light

)
criteria
using
the
Confusion
Assessment
Method
beginning
at
any
time
from
the
second
day
after

.

RESULTS
:

From
April
2
,
2005
,
through
October
30
,
2008
,
a
total
of
114
patients
were
randomized
.

The
prevalence
of
postoperative
delirium
was
significantly
lower
in
the
light
sedation
group
(
11/57
[
19
%
]
vs
23/57
[
40
%
]
in
the
deep
sedation
group
;
P=.02
)
,
indicating
that
1
incident
of
delirium
will
be
prevented
for
every
4.7
patients
treated
with
light
sedation
.

The
mean
+
/-
SD
number
of
days
of
delirium
during
hospitalization
was
lower
in
the
light
sedation
group
than
in
the
deep
sedation
group
(
0.5+/-1.5
days
vs
1.4+/-4.0
days
;
P=.01
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
use
of
light
propofol
sedation
decreased
the
prevalence
of
postoperative
delirium
by
50
%
compared
with
deep
sedation
.

Limiting

is
a
simple
,

,
and
cost
-
effective
intervention
for
preventing
postoperative

Sorafenib
-induced
acute
myocardial
infarction
due
to
coronary
artery
spasm
.

A
65-year
-
old
man
with
advanced
renal
cell
carcinoma
was
admitted
due
to
continuing
chest
pain
at
rest
.

Two
weeks
before
his
admission
,
sorafenib
had
been
started
.

He
was
diagnosed
with
non
-
ST
-
elevation
myocardial
infarction
by
laboratory
data
and
electrocardiogram
.

Enhanced
heart
magnetic
resonance
imaging
also
showed
subendocardial
infarction
.

However
,
there
was
no
stenosis
in
coronary
arteries
on
angiography
.

Coronary
artery
spasm
was
induced
by
a
provocative
test
.

Cessation
of
sorafenib
and
administration
of
Ca
-channel
blocker
and
nitrates
ameliorated
his
symptoms
,
but
relapse
occurred
after
resumption
of
sorafenib
.

Addition
of
oral
nicorandil
reduced
his
symptoms
and
maintained
stable
angina
status
.

We
report
the
first
case
of
sorafenib
-induced
coronary
artery
spasm
.

Sorafenib
is
a
multikinase
inhibitor
that
targets
signaling
pathways
necessary
for
cellular
proliferation
and
survival
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
Rho
/
ROCK
pathway
has
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
coronary
artery
spasm
.

Our
report
may
show
an
adverse
effect
on
the
Rho
/
ROCK
pathway
by
sorafenib
use
.

Anxiogenic
potential
of
ciprofloxacin
and
norfloxacin
in
rats
.

INTRODUCTION
:

The
possible
anxiogenic
effects
of
fluoroquinolones
,
namely
ciprofloxacin
and
norfloxacin
,
were
investigated
in
adult
Charles
Foster
albino
rats
of
either
sex
,
weighing
150
-
200
g.
METHODS
:

The
drugs
were
given
orally
,
in
doses
of
50
mg
/
kg
for
five
consecutive
days
and
the
experiments
were
performed
on
the
fifth
day
.

The
tests
included
open
-
field
exploratory
behaviour
,
elevated
plus
maze
and
elevated
zero
maze
,
social
interaction
and
novelty
-
suppressed
feeding
latency
behaviour
.

RESULTS
:

The
results
indicate
that
ciprofloxacin
-
and

norfloxacin
-treated
rats
showed

anxious
behaviour
in
comparison
to
control
rats
in
all
the
parameters
studied
.

However
,
ciprofloxacin
-
and
norfloxacin
-treated
rats
did
not
differ
significantly
from
each
other
in
various
behavioural
parameters
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
present
experimental
findings
substantiate
the
clinically
observed
anxiogenic
potential
of
ciprofloxacin
and
norfloxacin
.

Myocardial
Fas
ligand
expression
increases
susceptibility
to
AZT

-induced

cardiomyopathy
.

BACKGROUND
:

Dilated
cardiomyopathy

(
DCM
)
and
myocarditis
occur
in
many
HIV
-
infected
individuals
,
resulting
in
symptomatic
heart
failure
in
up
to
5
%
of
patients
.

Highly
active
antiretroviral
therapy
(
HAART
)
has
significantly
reduced
morbidity
and
mortality
of
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome

(
AIDS
)
,
but
has
resulted
in
an
increase
in
cardiac
and
skeletal
myopathies
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:

In
order
to
investigate
whether
the
HAART
component
zidovudine

(
3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine
;
AZT
)
triggers
the
Fas
-
dependent
cell
-
death
pathway
and
cause
cytoskeletal
disruption
in
a
murine
model
of
DCM
,
8-week
-
old
transgenic
(
expressing
Fas
ligand
in
the
myocardium
:

FasL
Tg
)
and
non
-
transgenic
(
NTg
)
mice
received
water
ad
libitum
containing
different
concentrations
of
AZT

(
0
,
0.07
,
0.2
,
and
0.7
mg
/
ml
)
.

After
6
weeks
,
cardiac
function
was
assessed
by
echocardiography
and
morphology
was
assessed
by
histopathologic
and
immunohistochemical
methods
.

NTg
and
untreated
FasL
Tg
mice
showed
little
or
no
change
in
cardiac
structure
or
function
.

In
contrast
,
AZT
-treated
FasL
Tg
mice
developed
cardiac
dilation
and
depressed
cardiac
function
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
with
concomitant
inflammatory
infiltration
of
both
ventricles
.

These
changes
were
associated
with
an
increased
sarcolemmal
expression
of
Fas
and
FasL
,
as
well
as
increased
activation
of
caspase
3
,
translocation
of
calpain
1
to
the
sarcolemma
and
sarcomere
,
and
increased
numbers
of
cells
undergoing
apoptosis
.

These
were
associated
with
changes
in
dystrophin
and
cardiac
troponin
I
localization
,
as
well
as
loss
of
sarcolemmal
integrity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
expression
of
Fas
ligand
in
the
myocardium
,
as
identified
in
HIV
-
positive
patients
,
might
increase
the
susceptibility
to
HAART
-
induced
cardiomyopathy
due
to
activation
of
apoptotic
pathways
,
resulting
in
cardiac
dilation
and
dysfunction
.

Valproate
-induced
chorea
and
encephalopathy
in
atypical
nonketotic
hyperglycinemia
.

Nonketotic
hyperglycinemia
is
a
disorder
of
amino
acid
metabolism
in
which
a
defect
in
the
glycine
cleavage
system
leads
to
an
accumulation
of
glycine
in
the
brain
and
other
body
compartments
.

In
the
classical
form
it
presents
as
neonatal
apnea
,
intractable
seizures
,
and
hypotonia
,
followed
by
significant
psychomotor
retardation
.

An
important
subset
of
children
with
nonketotic
hyperglycinemia
are
atypical
variants
who
present
in
a
heterogeneous
manner
.

This
report
describes
a
patient
with
mild
language
delay
and
mental
retardation
,
who
was
found
to
have
nonketotic
hyperglycinemia
following
her
presentation
with
acute
encephalopathy
and
chorea
shortly
after
initiation
of
valproate
therapy
.

Microinjection
of
ritanserin
into
the
CA1
region
of
hippocampus
improves
scopolamine

-induced

amnesia
in
adult
male
rats
.

The
effect
of
ritanserin

(
5-HT2
antagonist
)
on
scopolamine

(
muscarinic
cholinergic

antagonist)-induced
amnesia
in
Morris
water
maze
(
MWM
)
was
investigated
.

Rats
were
divided
into
eight
groups
and
bilaterally
cannulated
into
CA1
region
of
the
hippocampus
.

One
week
later
,
they
received
repeatedly
vehicles
(
saline
,
DMSO
,
saline+
DMSO
)
,
scopolamine

(
2
microg/0.5
microl
saline
/
side
;
30
min
before
training
)
,
ritanserin
(
2
,
4
and
8
microg/0.5
microl

DMSO
/side
;
20
min
before
training
)
and
scopolamine

(
2
microg/0.5
microl
;
30
min
before
ritanserin

injection)+
ritanserin

(
4
microg/0.5
microl
DMSO
)
through
cannulae
each
day
.

Animals
were
tested
for
four
consecutive
days
(
4
trial
/
day
)
in
MWM
during
which
the
position
of
hidden
platform
was
unchanged
.

In
the
fifth
day
,
the
platform
was
elevated
above
the
water
surface
in
another
position
to
evaluate
the
function
of
motor
,
motivational
and
visual
systems
.

The
results
showed
a
significant
increase
in
escape
latencies
and
traveled
distances
to
find
platform
in
scopolamine
-treated
group
as
compared
to
saline
group
.

Ritanserin
-treated
rats
(
4
microg/0.5
microl
/
side
)
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
the
mentioned
parameters
as
compared
to
DMSO
-treated
group
.

However
,
scopolamine
and
ritanserin
co
-
administration
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
in
escape
latencies
and
traveled
distances
as
compared
to
the
scopolamine
-treated
rats
.

Our
findings
show
that
microinjection
of
ritanserin
into
the
CA1
region
of
the
hippocampus
improves
the
scopolamine

-induced

amnesia
.

Hypoxia
in
renal
disease
with
proteinuria
and/or
glomerular
hypertension
.

Despite
the
increasing
need
to
identify
and
quantify
tissue
oxygenation
at
the
cellular
level
,
relatively
few
methods
have
been
available
.

In
this
study
,
we
developed
a
new
hypoxia
-responsive
reporter
vector
using
a
hypoxia
-responsive
element
of
the
5
'
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
untranslated
region
and
generated
a
novel
hypoxia
-sensing
transgenic
rat
.

We
then
applied
this
animal
model
to
the
detection
of
tubulointerstitial
hypoxia
in
the
diseased
kidney
.

With
this
model
,
we
were
able
to
identify
diffuse
cortical
hypoxia
in
the
puromycin
aminonucleoside
-induced

nephrotic
syndrome
and
focal
and
segmental
hypoxia
in
the
remnant
kidney
model
.

Expression
of
the
hypoxia
-responsive
transgene
increased
throughout
the
observation
period
,
reaching
2.2-fold
at
2
weeks
in
the
puromycin
aminonucleoside
model
and
2.6-fold
at
4
weeks
in
the
remnant
kidney
model
,
whereas
that
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
showed
a
mild
decrease
,
reflecting
distinct
behaviors
of
the
two
genes
.

The
degree
of
hypoxia
showed
a
positive
correlation
with
microscopic
tubulointerstitial
injury
in
both
models
.

Finally
,
we
identified
the
localization
of
proliferating
cell
nuclear
antigen
-
positive
,
ED-1-positive
,
and
terminal
dUTP
nick
-
end
labeled
-
positive
cells
in
the
hypoxic
cortical
area
in
the
remnant
kidney
model
.

We
propose
here
a
possible
pathological
tie
between
chronic
tubulointerstitial

hypoxia
and
progressive
glomerular
diseases
.

Consensus
statement
concerning
cardiotoxicity

occurring
during
haematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation
in
the
treatment
of
autoimmune
diseases
,
with
special
reference
to
systemic
sclerosis
and
multiple
sclerosis
.

Autologous
haematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation
is
now
a
feasible
and
effective
treatment
for
selected
patients
with
severe
autoimmune
diseases
.

Worldwide
,
over
650
patients
have
been
transplanted
in
the
context
of
phase
I
and
II
clinical
trials
.

The
results
are
encouraging
enough
to
begin
randomised
phase
III
trials
.

However
,
as
predicted
,
significant
transplant
-
related
morbidity
and
mortality
have
been
observed
.

This
is
primarily
due
to
complications
related
to
either
the
stage
of
the
disease
at
transplant
or
due
to
infections
.

The
number
of
deaths
related
to
cardiac
toxicity
is
low
.

However
,
caution
is
required
when
cyclophosphamide
or
anthracyclines
such
as
mitoxantrone
are
used
in
patients
with
a
possible
underlying
heart
damage
,
for
example
,
systemic
sclerosis
patients
.

In
November
2002
,
a
meeting
was
held
in
Florence
,
bringing
together
a
number
of
experts
in
various
fields
,
including
rheumatology
,
cardiology
,
neurology
,
pharmacology
and
transplantation
medicine
.

The
object
of
the
meeting
was
to
analyse
existing
data
,
both
published
or
available
,
in
the
European
Group
for
Blood
and
Marrow
Transplantation

autoimmune
disease
database
,
and
to
propose
a
safe
approach
to
such
patients
.

A
full
cardiological
assessment
before
and
during
the
transplant
emerged
as
the
major
recommendation
.

Immunohistochemical
study
on
inducible
type
of
nitric
oxide
(
iNOS
)
,
basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
(
bFGF
)
and
tumor
growth
factor
-
beta1
(
TGF
-
beta1
)
in
arteritis
induced
in
rats
by
fenoldopam
and
theophylline
,
vasodilators
.

Arteritis
induced
in
rats
by
vasodilators
,
fenoldopam
and
theophylline
,
was
examined
immunohistochemically
for
expressions
of
inducible
type
of
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
iNOS
)
,
basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
(
bFGF
)
and
tumor
growth
factor
-
beta1
(
TGF
-
beta1
)
.

Rats
were
administered

fenoldopam
for
24
hours
by
intravenous
infusion
with
or
without
following
repeated
daily
oral
administrations
of
theophylline
.

Irrespective
of
theophylline
administration
,
iNOS
antigens
were
remarkably
abundant
in
ED-1-positive
cells
on
day
5
and

8
post-
fenoldopam
-infusion
(
DPI
)
;
bFGF
antigens
were
remarkably
abundant
in
ED-1-positive
cells
on
1
and
3
DPI
;
TGF
-
beta1
antigens
were
observed
in
ED-1-positive
cells
on
and
after
5
DPI
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
peak
expression
of
iNOS
antigen
was
followed
by
that
of
bFGF
antigen
,
and
bFGF
may
have
a
suppressive
effect
on
iNOS
expression
in
these
rat
arteritis
models
.

On
the
other
hand
,
TGF
-
beta1
was
not
considered
to
have
a
suppressive
effect
on
iNOS
expression
in
these
models
.

Low
-
molecular
-
weight
heparin
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
mechanical
heart
valves
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
interruption
of
oral
anticoagulant
(
OAC
)
administration
is
sometimes
indicated
in
patients
with
mechanical
heart
valves
,
mainly
before
noncardiac
surgery
,
non
-
surgical
interventions
,
and
pregnancy
.

Unfractionated
heparin

(
UH
)
is
currently
the
substitute
for
selected
patients
.

Low
-
molecular
-
weight
heparin

(
LMWH
)
offers
theoretical
advantages
over
UH
,
but
is
not
currently
considered
in
clinical
guidelines
as
an
alternative
to
UH
in
patients
with
prosthetic
valves
.

HYPOTHESIS
:

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
review
the
data
accumulated
so
far
on
the
use
of
LMWH
in
this
patient
population
and
to
discuss
its
applicability
in
common
practice
.

METHODS
:

For
this
paper
,
the
current
medical
literature
on
LMWH
in
patients
with
mechanical
heart
valves
was
extensively
reviewed
.

RESULTS
:

There
were
eight
series
and
six
case
reports
.

None
of
the
studies
was
randomized
,
and
only
one
was
prospective
.

Data
to
establish
the
thromboembolic
risk
were
incomplete
.

After
excluding
case
reports
,
the
following
groups
were
constructed
:
(
a
)
short
-
term
administration
,
after
valve
insertion
(
n
=
212
)
;
(
b
)
short
-
term
,
perioperative
(
noncardiac)/periprocedural
(
n
=
114
)
;
(
c
)
long
-
term
,
due
to
intolerance
to
OAC
(
n
=
16
)
;
(
d
)
long
-
term
,
in
pregnancy
(
n
=
10
)
.

The
incidence
rate
of
thromboembolism
was
0.9
%
for
all
the
studies
and
0.5
,
0
,
20
,
and
0
%
in
groups
a
,
b
,
c
,
and
d
,
respectively
;
for
hemorrhage
,
the
overall
rate
was
3.4
%
(
3.8
,
2.6
,
10
,
and
0
%
for
the
respective
groups
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
patients
with
mechanical
heart
valves
,
short
-
term
LMWH
therapy
compares
favorably
with
UH
.

Data
on
mid-
and
long
-
term
LMWH
administration
in
these
patients
are
sparse
.

Further
randomized
studies
are
needed
to
confirm
the
safety
and
precise
indications
for
the
use
of
LMWH
in
patients
with
mechanical
heart
valves
.

Topiramate
-induced
nephrolithiasis
.

Topiramate
is
a
recently
developed
antiepileptic
medication
that
is
becoming
more
widely
prescribed
because
of
its
efficacy
in
treating
refractory
seizures
.

Urologists
should
be
aware
that
this
medication
can
cause
metabolic
acidosis
in
patients
secondary
to
inhibition
of
carbonic
anhydrase
.

In
addition
,
a
distal
tubular
acidification
defect
may
result
,
thus
impairing
the
normal
compensatory
drop
in
urine
pH.
These
factors
can
lead
to
the
development
of
calcium
phosphate
nephrolithiasis
.

We
report
the
first
two
cases
of
topiramate
-induced
nephrolithiasis
in
the
urologic
literature
.

Spironolactone
:
is
it
a
novel
drug
for
the
prevention
of
amphotericin
B
-related
hypokalemia
in
cancer
patients
?

OBJECTIVE
:

Nephrotoxicity
is
the
major
adverse
effect
of
amphotericin
B

(
AmB
)
,
often
limiting
administration
of
full
dosage
.

Selective
distal
tubular
epithelial

toxicity
seems
to
be
responsible
for
the
profound
potassium
wasting
that
is
a
major
clinical
side
effect
of
treatment
with
AmB
.

Potassium
depletion
also
potentiates
the
tubular
toxicity
of
AmB
.

This
study
was
designed
to
assess
the
ability
of
spironolactone
to
reduce
potassium
requirements
and
to
prevent
hypokalemia
in
neutropenic
patients
on
AmB
treatment
.

METHODS
:

In
this
study
26
patients
with
various
hematological
disorders
were
randomized
to
receive
either
intravenous
AmB
alone
or
AmB
and
oral
spironolactone
100
mg
twice
daily
when
developing
a
proven
or
suspected
fungal
infection
.

RESULTS
:

Patients
receiving
concomitant
AmB
and
spironolactone
had
significantly
higher
plasma

potassium
levels
than
those
receiving
AmB
alone
(
P
=
0.0027
)
.

Those
patients
receiving
AmB
and
spironolactone
required
significantly
less
potassium
supplementation
to
maintain
their
plasma
potassium
within
the
normal
range
(
P
=
0.022
)
.

Moreover
,
urinary
potassium
losses
were
significantly
less
in
patients
receiving
AmB
and
spironolactone
than
those
receiving
AmB
alone
(
P
=
0.040
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
study
showed
that
spironolactone
can
reduce
potassium
requirements
and
prevent
hypokalemia
by
reducing
urinary
potassium
loss
in
neutropenic
patients
on
AmB
treatment
.

Dopamine

D2
receptor
signaling
controls
neuronal
cell
death
induced
by
muscarinic
and
glutamatergic
drugs
.

Dopamine
(
DA
)
,
through
D1/D2
receptor
-
mediated
signaling
,
plays
a
major
role
in
the
control
of
epileptic
seizures
arising
in
the
limbic
system
.

Excitotoxicity
leading
to
neuronal
cell
death
in
the
affected
areas
is
a
major
consequence
of
seizures
at
the
cellular
level
.

In
this
respect
,
little
is
known
about
the
role
of
DA
receptors
in
the
occurrence
of
epilepsy
-induced
neuronal
cell
death
.

Here
we
analyze
the
occurrence
of
seizures
and
neurotoxicity
in
D2R

-/-
mice
treated
with
the
cholinergic
agonist
pilocarpine
.

We
compared
these
results
with
those
previously
obtained
with
kainic
acid

(
KA
)
,
a
potent
glutamate
agonist
.

Importantly
,
D2R
-/-
mice
develop
seizures
at
doses
of
both
drugs
that
are
not
epileptogenic
for
WT
littermates
and
show
greater
neurotoxicity
.

However
,
pilocarpine
-induced

seizures
result
in
a
more
widespread
neuronal
death
in
both
WT
and

D2R

-/-
brains
in
comparison
to
KA
.

Thus
,
the
absence
of
D2R
lowers
the
threshold
for
seizures
induced
by
both
glutamate
and
acetylcholine
.

Moreover
,
the
dopaminergic
control
of
epilepsy
-induced
neurodegeneration
seems
to
be
mediated
by
distinct
interactions
of
D2R
signaling
with
these
two
neurotransmitters
.

Treatment
of
risperidone
-induced
hyperprolactinemia
with
a
dopamine
agonist
in
children
.

BACKGROUND
:

Risperidone
,
a
potent
antagonist
of
both
serotonergic
(
5HT2A
)
and
dopaminergic
D2
receptors
is
associated
with
hyperprolactinemia
in
adults
and
children
.

Chronically
elevated
prolactin
levels
in
children
with
prolactinomas
may
be
associated
with
arrested
growth
and
development
resulting
in
either
delayed
puberty
or
short
stature
.

These
possibilities
stress
the
importance
of
developing
a
safe
and
effective
approach
to
drug
-
induced
hyperprolactinemia
in
youth
.

We
report
the
successful
treatment
of
risperidone
-induced

hyperprolactinemia
with
cabergoline
in
youth
.

METHODS

:
We
undertook
a
retrospective
case
review
of
four
children
with
risperidone
-induced

hyperprolactinemia
treated
with
cabergoline
.

RESULTS
:

Four
males
(
age
6
-
11
years
)
with
Diagnostic
and
Statistical
Manual
of
Mental
Disorders

(
fourth
edition
)

bipolar
disorder
or
psychoses
,
with

risperidone
-induced
elevations
in
serum
prolactin
levels
(
57.5
-
129
ng
/
mL
,
normal
5
-
15
ng
/
mL
)
,
were
treated
with
cabergoline

(
mean
dose
2.13
+
/-

0.09
mg
/
week
)
.

When
serum
prolactin
levels
normalized
in
all
four
subjects
(
mean
11.2
+
/-
10.9
ng
/
mL
)
,
the
cabergoline
dose
was
reduced
to
1
mg
/
week
in
three
of
four
subjects
.

The
mean
duration
of
therapy
with
cabergoline
was
523.5
+
/-

129.7
days
,
and
the
mean
duration
of
therapy
with
risperidone
was
788.5
+
/-

162.5
days
.

Cabergoline
was
well
tolerated
without
adverse
effects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Cabergoline
may
be
useful
for
the
treatment
of

risperidone
-induced

hyperprolactinemia
in
youth
;
however
,
further
research
is
needed
.

Cholestatic
jaundice
associated
with
the
use
of
metformin
.

We
report
a
patient
who
developed
cholestatic
jaundice
shortly
after
initiation
of
treatment
with
metformin
hydrochloride
.

Ultrasound
of
the
liver
and
abdominal
CT
were
normal
.

An
ERCP
showed
normal
biliary
anatomy
.

A
percutaneous
liver
biopsy
was
obtained
showing
marked
cholestasis
,
with
portal
edema
,
ductular
proliferation
,
and
acute
inflammation
.

Metformin
hydrochloride
was
discontinued
,
and
the
patient
's
jaundice
resolved
slowly
over
a
period
of
several
months
.

Given
the
onset
of
his
jaundice
2
wk
after
the
initiation
of
metformin
,
we
believe
that
this
case
represents
an
example
of
metformin

-associated

hepatotoxicity
,
the
first
such
case
reported
.

Electro
-
oculography
,
electroretinography
,
visual
evoked
potentials
,
and
multifocal
electroretinography
in
patients
with
vigabatrin
-attributed
visual
field
constriction
.

PURPOSE
:

Symptomatic

visual
field
constriction
thought
to
be
associated
with
vigabatrin
has
been
reported
.

The
current
study
investigated
the
visual
fields
and
visual
electrophysiology
of
eight
patients
with
known

vigabatrin
-attributed

visual
field
loss
,
three
of
whom
were
reported
previously
.

Six
of
the
patients
were
no
longer
receiving
vigabatrin
.

METHODS
:

The
central
and
peripheral
fields
were
examined
with
the
Humphrey
Visual
Field
Analyzer
.

Full
visual
electrophysiology
,
including
flash
electroretinography
(
ERG
)
,
pattern
electroretinography
,
multifocal
ERG
using
the
VERIS
system
,
electro
-
oculography
,
and
flash
and
pattern
visual
evoked
potentials
,
was
undertaken
.

RESULTS
:

Seven
patients
showed
marked
visual
field
constriction
with
some
sparing
of
the
temporal
visual
field
.

The
eighth
exhibited
concentric
constriction
.

Most
electrophysiological
responses
were
usually
just
within
normal
limits
;
two
patients
had
subnormal
Arden
electro
-
oculography
indices
;
and
one
patient
showed
an
abnormally
delayed
photopic
b
wave
.

However
,
five
patients
showed
delayed
30-Hz
flicker
b
waves
,
and
seven
patients
showed
delayed
oscillatory
potentials
.

Multifocal
ERG
showed
abnormalities
that
sometimes
correlated
with
the
visual
field
appearance
and
confirmed
that
the
deficit
occurs
at
the
retinal
level
.

CONCLUSION
:

Marked
visual
field
constriction
appears
to
be
associated
with
vigabatrin
therapy
.

The
field
defects
and
some
electrophysiological
abnormalities
persist
when
vigabatrin
therapy
is
withdrawn
.

Conversion
to
rapamycin
immunosuppression
in
renal
transplant
recipients
:
report
of
an
initial
experience
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
RAPA
conversion
in
patients
undergoing
cyclosporine

(
CsA
)
or
tacrolimus

(
Tac
)
toxicity
.

METHODS
:

Twenty
renal
transplant
recipients
were
switched
to
fixed
dose
rapamycin

(
RAPA
)
(
5
mg
/
day
)
0

to
204
months
posttransplant
.

Drug
monitoring
was
not
initially
used
to
adjust
doses
.

The
indications
for
switch
were
chronic
CsA
or
Tac
nephrotoxicity

(
12
)
,
acute
CsA
or
Tac
toxicity

(
3
)
,
severe
facial
dysmorphism
(
2
)
,
posttransplant
lymphoproliferative
disorder

(
PTLD
)
in
remission
(
2
)
,
and
hepatotoxicity
in
1
.

Follow
-
up
is
7
to
24
months
.

RESULTS
:

In
the
12
patients
switched
because
of
chronic
nephrotoxicity

there
was
a
significant
decrease
in
serum
creatinine

[
233+/-34
to
210+/-56
micromol
/
liter
(
P<0.05
)
at
6
months
]
.

Facial
dysmorphism
improved
in
two
patients
.

No
relapse
of
PTLD
was
observed
.

Five
patients
developed
pneumonia

(
two
Pneumocystis
carinii
pneumonia
,
one
infectious
mononucleosis
with
polyclonal
PTLD
lung
infiltrate
)
and
two
had
bronchiolitis
obliterans
.

There
were
no
deaths
.

RAPA
was
discontinued
in
four
patients
,
because
of
pneumonia
in
two
,
PTLD
in
one
,
and
oral
aphtous
ulcers
in
one
.

RAPA
levels
were
high
(
>
15
ng
/
ml
)
in
7
of
13
(
54
%
)
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

RAPA
conversion
provides
adequate
immunosuppression
to
enable
CsA
withdrawal
.

However
,
when
converting
patients
to
RAPA
drug
levels
should
be
monitored
to
avoid
over
-
immunosuppression
and
adequate
antiviral
and
Pneumocystis
carinii
pneumonia
prophylaxis
should
be
given
.

Worsening
of
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
by
motor
and
mental
tasks
.

Ten
patients
who
had
Parkinson
's
disease
with
disabling
dyskinesia
were
included
in
this
study
to
evaluate
the
role
of
mental
(
mental
calculation
)
and
motor
(
flexion
/
extension
of
right
fingers
,
flexion
/
extension
of
left
fingers
,
flexion
/
extension
of
the
neck
,
speaking
aloud
)
tasks
on
the
worsening
of
peak
-
dose
dyskinesia
following
administration
of
an
effective
single
dose
of
apomorphine
.

Compared
with
the
score
at
rest
(
1.3+/-0.3
)
,
a
significant
aggravation
of
the
dyskinesia
score
was
observed
during
speaking
aloud
(
5.2+/-1.1
,
p<0.05
)
,
movements
of
right

(
4.5+/-1.0
,
p<0.05
)
and
left
(
3.7+/-0.8
,
p<0.05
)
fingers
,
movements
of
the
neck
(
5.1+/-1.0
,
p<0.05
)
,
and
mental
calculation
(
3.1+/-1.0
,
p<0.05
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
activation
tasks
such
as
"
speaking
aloud
"
could
be
used
for
objective
assessment
of
dyskinesia
severity
.

Structural
and
functional
impairment
of
mitochondria
in
adriamycin
-induced

cardiomyopathy
in
mice
:
suppression
of
cytochrome
c
oxidase
II
gene
expression
.

The
use
of
adriamycin

(
ADR
)
in
cancer
chemotherapy
has
been
limited
due
to
its
cumulative
cardiovascular
toxicity
.

Earlier
observations
that
ADR
interacts
with
mitochondrial
cytochrome
c
oxidase
(
COX
)
and
suppresses
its
enzyme
activity
led
us
to
investigate
ADR
's
action
on
the
cardiovascular
functions
and
heart
mitochondrial
morphology
in
Balb
-
c
mice
i.p
.
treated
with
ADR
for
several
weeks
.

At
various
times
during
treatment
,
the
animals
were
assessed
for
cardiovascular
functions
by
electrocardiography
and
for
heart
tissue
damage
by
electron
microscopy
.

In
parallel
,
total
RNA
was
extracted
from
samples
of
dissected
heart
and
analyzed
by
Northern
blot
hybridization
to
determine
the
steady
-
state
level
of
three
RNA
transcripts
encoded
by
the
COXII
,
COXIII
,
and
COXIV
genes
.

Similarly
,
samples
obtained
from
the
liver
of
the
same
animals
were
analyzed
for
comparative
studies
.

Our
results
indicated
that
1
)
treatment
of
mice
with
ADR
caused
cardiovascular
arrhythmias
characterized
by
bradycardia
,
extension
of
ventricular
depolarization
time
(
tQRS
)
,
and
failure
of
QRS
at
high
concentrations
(
10
-
14
mg
/
kg
body
weight
cumulative
dose
)
;
2
)
the
heart
mitochondria
underwent
swelling
,
fusion
,
dissolution
,
and/or
disruption
of
mitochondrial
cristae
after
several
weeks
of
treatment
.

Such
abnormalities
were
not
observed
in
the
mitochondria
of
liver
tissue
;
and
3
)
among
the
three
genes
of
COX
enzyme
examined
,
only
COXII
gene
expression
was
suppressed
by
ADR
treatment
,
mainly
after
8
weeks
in
both
heart
and
liver
.

Knowing
that
heart
mitochondria
represent
almost
40
%
of
heart
muscle
by
weight
,
we
conclude
that
the
deteriorating
effects
of
ADR
on
cardiovascular
function
involve
mitochondrial
structural
and
functional
impairment
.

Enhanced
bradycardia
induced
by
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonists
in
rats
pretreated
with
isoniazid
.

High
doses
of
isoniazid
increase
hypotension

induced
by
vasodilators
and
change
the
accompanying
reflex
tachycardia
to
bradycardia
,
an
interaction
attributed
to
decreased
synthesis
of
brain
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid

(
GABA
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
possible
enhancement
by
isoniazid
of
bradycardia
induced
by
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonists
was
determined
in
rats
anaesthetised
with
chloralose
-
urethane
.

Isoniazid
significantly
increased

bradycardia
after
propranolol
,
pindolol
,
labetalol
and
atenolol
,
as
well
as
after
clonidine
,
but
not
after
hexamethonium
or
carbachol
.

Enhancement
was
not
observed
in
rats
pretreated
with
methylatropine
or
previously
vagotomised
.

These
results
are
compatible
with
interference
by
isoniazid
with
GABAergic
inhibition
of
cardiac
parasympathetic
tone
.

Such
interference
could
be
exerted
centrally
,
possibly
at
the
nucleus
ambiguus
,
or
peripherally
at
the
sinus
node
.

Epileptogenic
activity
of
folic
acid
after
drug
induces
SLE

(
folic
acid
and
epilepsy
)
OBJECTIVE
:

To
study
the
effect
of
folic
acid

-containing
multivitamin
supplementation
in
epileptic
women
before
and
during
pregnancy
in
order
to
determine
the
rate
of
structural
birth
defects
and
epilepsy
-related
side
effects
.

STUDY
DESIGN
:

First
a
randomised
trial
,
later
periconception
care
including
in
total
12225
females
.

RESULTS
:

Of
60
epileptic

women
with
periconceptional
folic
acid
(
0.8
mg)-containing
multivitamin
supplementation
,
no
one
developed
epilepsy
-related
side
effects
during
the
periconception
period
.

One
epileptic

woman
delivered
a
newborn
with
cleft
lip
and
palate
.

Another
patient
exhibited
with
a
cluster
of
seizures
after
the
periconception
period
using
another
multivitamin
.

This
22-year
-
old
epileptic
woman
was
treated
continuously
by
carbamazepine
and
a
folic
acid

(
1
mg)-containing
multivitamin
from
the
20th
week
of
gestation
.

She
developed
status
epilepticus
and
later
symptoms
of
systemic
lupus
erythematodes
.

Her
pregnancy
ended
with
stillbirth
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
epileptic
pregnant
patient
's
autoimmune
disease
(

probably
drug
-
induced
lupus
)
could
damage
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
,
therefore
the
therapeutic
dose
(
>
or
=
1
mg
)
of
folic
acid
triggered
a
cluster
of
seizures
.

Physiological
dose
(
1
mg
)
of

folic
acid
both
in
healthy
and
60
epileptic
women
,
all
without
any
autoimmune
disease
,
did
not
increase
the
risk
for
epileptic
seizures
.

Effects
of
cisapride
on
symptoms
and
postcibal
small

bowel
motor
function
in
patients
with
irritable
bowel
syndrome
.

BACKGROUND
:

Irritable
bowel
syndrome
is
a
common
cause
of
abdominal
pain
and
discomfort
and
may
be
related
to
disordered
gastrointestinal
motility
.

Our
aim
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
long

term
treatment
with
a
prokinetic
agent
,
cisapride
,
on
postprandial

)
.

METHODS
:

Thirty
-
eight
patients
with
IBS

(
constipation

RESULTS
:

In
diarrhoea

patients
significant
differences
in

were
observed
between
the
cisapride

CONCLUSION
:

Cisapride
affects

characteristics
and
some
symptoms
in
IBS
.

Clarithromycin
-induced
ventricular
tachycardia
.

Clarithromycin
is
a
relatively
new
macrolide
antibiotic
that
offers
twice
-
daily
dosing
.

It
differs
from
erythromycin
only
in
the
methylation
of
the
hydroxyl
group
at
position
6
.

Although
the
side
-
effect
profile
of
erythromycin
is
established
,
including
gastroenteritis
and
interactions
with
other
drugs
subject
to
hepatic
mixed
-
function
oxidase
metabolism
,
experience
with
the
newer
macrolides
is
still
being
recorded
.

Cardiotoxicity
has
been
demonstrated
after
both
intravenous
and
oral
administration
of
erythromycin
but
has
never
been
reported
with
the
newer
macrolides
.

We
report
a
case
of
ventricular
dysrhythmias
that
occurred
after
six
therapeutic
doses
of
clarithromycin
.

The
dysrhythmias
resolved
after
discontinuation
of
the
drug
.

Persistent
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
following
lithium
therapy
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
patient
who
developed
severe
hypernatraemic
dehydration
following
a
head
injury
.

Ten
years
previously
he
had
been
diagnosed
to
have
lithium

-induced

nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
,
and
lithium
therapy
had
been
discontinued
.

He
remained
thirsty
and
polyuric
despite
cessation
of
lithium
and
investigations
on
admission
showed
him
to
have
normal
osmoregulated
thirst
and
vasopressin
secretion
,
with
clear
evidence
of
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
.

Lithium
induced
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
is
considered
to
be
reversible
on
cessation
of
therapy
but
polyuria
persisted
in
this
patient
for
ten
years
after
lithium
was
stopped
.

We
discuss
the
possible
renal
mechanisms
and
the
implications
for
management
of
patients
with
lithium

-induced

nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
.

Late
cardiotoxicity
after
treatment
for
a
malignant
bone
tumor
.

Cardiac
function
was
assessed
in
long
-
term
survivors
of
malignant
bone
tumors
who
were
treated
according
to
Rosen
's
T5
or
T10
protocol
,
both
including
doxorubicin
.

Thirty
-
one
patients
,
age
10
-
45
years
(
median
age
17.8
years
)
were
evaluated
2.3
-
14.1
years
(
median
8.9
years
)
following
completion
of
treatment
.

Cumulative
doses
of
doxorubicin
were
225
-
550
mg
/
m2
(
median
dose
360
)
.

The
evaluation
consisted
of
a
history
,
physical
examination
,
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
,
signal
averaged
ECG
,
24-hour
ambulatory
ECG
,
echocardiography
and
radionuclide
angiography
.

Eighteen
of
31
(
58
%
)

patients
showed
cardiac
toxicity
,
defined
as
having
one
or
more
of
the
following
abnormalities
:
late
potentials
,
complex
ventricular
arrhythmias
,
left
ventricular
dilation
,
decreased
shortening
fraction
,
or
decreased
ejection
fraction
.

The
incidence
of
cardiac
abnormalities
increased
with
length
of
follow
-
up
(
P
or
=
.05
)
.

No
correlation
could
be
demonstrated
between
cumulative
dose
of
doxorubicin
and
cardiac
status
,
except
for
heart
rate
variability
.

When
adjusted
to
body
surface
area
,
the
left
ventricular
posterior
wall
thickness
(
LVPW
index
)
was
decreased
in
all
patients
.

The
incidence
of
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
is
high
and
increases
with
follow
-
up
,
irrespective
of
cumulative
dose
.

Life
-
long
cardiac
follow
-
up
in
these
patients
is
warranted
.

The
results
of
our
study
suggest
that
heart
rate
variability
and
LVPW
index
could
be
sensitive
indicators
for
cardiotoxicity
.

Venous
complications
of
midazolam
versus
diazepam
.

Although
some
studies
have
suggested
fewer
venous
complications
are
associated
with
midazolam
than
with
diazepam
for
endoscopic
procedures
,
this
variable
has
not
been
well
documented
.

We
prospectively
evaluated
the
incidence
of
venous
complications
after
intravenous
injection
of
diazepam
or
midazolam
in
122
consecutive
patients
undergoing
colonoscopy
and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
.

Overall
,
venous
complications
were
more
frequent
with
diazepam

(
22
of
62
patients
)
than
with
midazolam

(
4
of
60
patients
)
(
p
0.001
)
.

A
palpable
venous
cord
was
present
in
23
%
(
14
of
62
)
of
patients
in
the
diazepam
group
,
compared
with
2
%
(
1
of
60
patients
)
in
the
midazolam
group
(
p
0.002
)
.

Pain
at
the
injection
site
occurred
in
35
%
(
22
of
62
)
of
patients
in
the
diazepam
group
compared
with
7
%
(
4
of
60
patients
)
in
the
midazolam
group
(
p
0.001
)
.

Swelling
and
warmth
at
the
injection
site
were
not
significantly
different
between
the
two
groups
.

Smoking
,
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
use
,
intravenous
catheter
site
,
dwell
time
of
the
needle
,
alcohol
use
,
and
pain
during
the
injection
had
no
effect
on
the
incidence
of
venous
complications
.

Tetany
and
rhabdomyolysis
due
to
surreptitious
furosemide
--importance
of
magnesium
supplementation
.

Diuretics
may
induce
hypokalemia
,
hypocalcemia
and
hypomagnesemia
.

While
severe
hypokalemia
may
cause
muscle
weakness
,
severe
hypomagnesemia
is
associated
with
muscle
spasms
and
tetany
which
can
not
be
corrected
by
potassium
and
calcium
supplementation
alone
(
1,2
)
.

Surreptitious
diuretic
ingestion
has
been
described
,
mainly
in
women
who
are
concerned
that
they
are
obese
or
edematous
.

Symptomatic

hypokalemia
has
been
reported
in
such
patients
(
3
-
7
)
and
in
one
case
hypocalcemia
was
observed
(
8)
,
but
the
effects
of
magnesium
depletion
were
not
noted
in
these
patients
.

Loss
of
glutamate
decarboxylase
mRNA
-
containing
neurons
in
the
rat
dentate
gyrus
following
pilocarpine

-induced

seizures
.

In
situ
hybridization
methods
were
used
to
determine
if
glutamic
acid
decarboxylase
(
GAD
)

mRNA
-
containing
neurons
within
the
hilus
of
the
dentate
gyrus
are
vulnerable
to
seizure
-induced
damage
in
a
model
of
chronic
seizures
.

Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
injected
intraperitoneally
with
pilocarpine
,
and
the
hippocampal
formation
was
studied
histologically
at
1
,
2
,
4
,
and
8
week
intervals
after
pilocarpine

-induced
seizures
.

In
situ
hybridization
histochemistry
,
using
a
digoxigenin
-labeled
GAD
cRNA
probe
,
demonstrated
a
substantial
decrease
in
the
number
of
GAD
mRNA
-
containing
neurons
in
the
hilus
of
the
dentate
gyrus
in
the
pilocarpine
-treated
rats
as
compared
to
controls
at
all
time
intervals
.

Additional
neuronanatomical
studies
,
including
cresyl
violet
staining
,
neuronal
degeneration
methods
,
and
histochemical
localization
of
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
,
suggested
that
the
decrease
in
the
number
of
GAD
mRNA
-
containing
neurons
was
related
to
neuronal
loss
rather
than
to
a
decrease
in
GAD
mRNA
levels
.

The
loss
of
GAD
mRNA
-
containing
neurons
in
the
hilus
contrasted
with
the
relative
preservation
of
labeled
putative
basket
cells
along
the
inner
margin
of
the
granule
cell
layer
.

Quantitative
analyses
of
labeled
neurons
in
three
regions
of
the
dentate
gyrus
in
the
1
and
2
week
groups
showed
statistically
significant
decreases
in
the
mean
number
of
GAD
mRNA
-
containing
neurons
in
the
hilus
of
both
groups
of
experimental
animals
.

No
significant
differences
were
found
in
the
molecular
layer
or
the
granule
cell
layer
,
which
included
labeled
neurons
along
the
lower
margin
of
the
granule
cell
layer
.

The
results
indicate
that
,
in
this
model
,
a
subpopulation
of
GAD
mRNA
-
containing
neurons
within
the
dentate
gyrus
is
selectively
vulnerable
to
seizure
-induced
damage
.

Such
differential
vulnerability
appears
to
be
another
indication
of
the
heterogeneity
of
GABA
neurons
.

Protective
effect
of
misoprostol
on
indomethacin
induced

renal
dysfunction
in
elderly
patients
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
evaluate
the
possible
protective
effects
of
misoprostol
on
renal
function
in
hospitalized
elderly
patients
treated
with
indomethacin
.

METHODS
:
Forty
-
five
hospitalized
elderly
patients
(
>
65
years
old
)
who
required
therapy
with
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAID
)
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
either
indomethacin
,
150
mg
/
day
(
Group
A
)
,
or
indomethacin
150
mg
/
day
plus
misoprostol
at
0.6
mg
/
day
(
Group
B
)
.

Laboratory
variables
of
renal
function
[
serum

creatinine
,
blood
urea
nitrogen

(
BUN
)
and
electrolytes
]
were
evaluated
before
initiation
of
therapy
and
every
2
days
,
until
termination
of
the
study
(
a
period
of
at
least
6
days
)
.

Response
to
treatment
was
estimated
by
the
visual
analog
scale
for
severity
of
pain
.

RESULTS
:

Forty
-
two
patients
completed
the
study
,
22
in
Group
A
and
20
in
Group
B.
BUN
and
creatinine
increased
by
>
50
%
of
baseline
levels
in
54
and
45
%
of
Group
A
patients
,
respectively
,
compared
to
only
20
and
10
%
of
Group
B
patients
(
p
0.05
)
.

Potassium

(
K
)
increment
of
0.6
mEq
/
l
or
more
was
observed
in
50
%
of
Group
A
,
but
in
only
15
%
of
Group
B
patients
(
p
0.05
)
.

The
mean
increments
in
BUN
,
creatinine
,
and
K
were
reduced
by
63
,
80
,
and
42
%
,
respectively
,
in
Group
B
patients
compared
to
Group
A.
Response
to
treatment
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
2
groups
.

CONCLUSION
:
Hospitalized
elderly
patients
are
at
risk
for
developing
indomethacin
related
renal
dysfunction
.

Addition
of
misoprostol
can
minimize
this
renal
impairment
without
affecting
pain
control
.

Nephrotoxic
effects
of
aminoglycoside
treatment
on
renal
protein
reabsorption
and
accumulation
.

To
quantify
the
effects
of
gentamicin
,
kanamycin
and
netilmicin
on
renal
protein
reabsorption
and
accumulation
,
these
drugs
were
administered
to
rats
intraperitoneally
(
30
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
for
7
,
14
or
21
days
.

Scanning
electron
microscopy
of
the
glomerular
endothelia
,
urinary
measurements
of
sodium
,
potassium
,
endogenous
lysozyme
,
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
D
-
glucosaminidase
(
NAG
)
as
well
as
clearance
and
accumulation
experiments
after
i.v
.

administration
of
egg
-
white
lysozyme
and
measurements
of
inulin
clearance
(
GFR
)
were
done
in
each
treatment
group
.

Gentamicin
administration
decreased
diameter
,
density
and
shape
of
endothelial
fenestrae
.

Kanamycin
and
netilmicin
appeared
to
have
no
effect
at
the
dose
used
.

All
three
aminoglycosides
decreased
GFR
and
increased
urinary
excretion
of
sodium
and
potassium
.

While
gentamicin
and
kanamycin
decreased
the
percentage
reabsorption
and
accumulation
of
lysozyme
after
i.v
.

administration
of
egg
-
white
lysozyme
netilmicin
had
no
effect
.

Daily
excretion
of
total
protein
,
endogenous
lysozyme
and
NAG
increased
only
after
treatment
with
kanamycin
and
gentamicin
.

Thus
,
aminoglycosides
may
act
as
nephrotoxicants
at
glomerular
and/or
tubular
level
inducing
impairment
of
renal
reabsorption
and
accumulation
of
proteins
.

Pharmacology
of
GYKI-41
099

(
chlorpropanol
,
Tobanum
)
a
new
potent
beta
-
adrenergic
antagonist
.

The
compound
GYKI-41
099
,
as
a
beta
-
adrenergic
antagonist
,
is
3
-
8
times
more
potent
than
propranolol
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Its
antiarrhythmic
effectiveness
surpasses
that
of
propranolol
and
pindolol
inhibiting
the
ouabain
arrhythmia
in
dogs
and
cats
.

GYKI-41
900
has
a
negligible
cardiodepressant
activity
;
it
is
not
cardioselective
.

The
compound
shows
a
rapid
and
long
lasting
effect
.

There
was
a
prolonged
elimination
of
the
radioactivity
after
the
injection
of
14C-41
099
to
rats
and
dogs
.

The
half
life
of
the
unlabeled
substance
in
humans
was
more
than
10
hours
.

Chorea
associated
with
oral
contraception
.

Three
patients
developed
chorea
while
receiving
oral
contraceptives
.

Two
were
young
patients
whose
chorea
developed
long
after
treatment
had
been
started
and
disappeared
soon
after
it
had
been
discontinued
.

The
third
patient
had
acute

amphetamine
-induced

chorea
after
prolonged
oral
contraception
.

Prolonged
administration
of
female
sex
hormones
is
a
possible
cause
of
chorea
in
women
who
have
not
previously
had
chorea
or
rheumatic
fever
.

Reversal
of
ammonia
coma
in
rats
by
L
-
dopa
:
a
peripheral
effect
.

Ammonia
coma
was
produced
in
rats
within
10
to
15
minutes
of
an
intraperitonealinjection
of
1.7
mmol
NH4CL
.

This
coma
was
prevented
with
1.68
mmol
L
-
dopa

given
by
gastric
intubation
15
minutes
before
the
ammonium
salt
injection
.

The
effect
of
L
-
dopa
was
correlated
with
a
decrease
in
blood
and
brain
ammonia
,
an
increase
in
brain
dopamine
,
and
an
increase
in
renal
excretion
of
ammonia
and
urea
.

Intraventricular
infusion
of
dopamine
sufficient
to
raise
the
brain
dopamine
to
the
same
extent
did
not
prevent
the
ammonia
coma
nor
affect
the
blood
and
brain
ammonia
concentrations
.

Bilateral
nephrectomy
eliminated
the
beneficial
effect
of
L
-
dopa
on
blood
and
brain
ammonia
and
the
ammonia

coma
was
not
prevented
.

Thus
,
the
reduction
in
blood
and
brain
ammonia
and
the
prevention
of
ammonia
coma
after
L
-
dopa
,
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
peripheral
effect
of
dopamine
on
renal
function
rather
than
its
central
action
.

These
results
provide
a
reasonable
explanation
for
the
beneficial
effects
observed
in
some
encephalopathic
patients
receiving
L
-
dopa
.

Heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
after
liver
transplantation
.

BACKGROUND
:

Unfractionated
heparin
sodium

(
UFH
)
or
low
-
molecular
weight
heparin
(
LMWH
)
is
used
in
anticoagulant
protocols
at
several
institutions
to
prevent
thrombosis
after
liver
transplantation
.

Heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia

(
HIT
)
is
an
adverse
immune
-
mediated
reaction
to
heparin
,
resulting
in
platelet
count
decreases
of
more
than
50
%
.

The
frequencies
of
HIT
after
liver
transplantation
and
platelet

)

positivity
in
liver
transplantation
patients
,
however
,
are
unknown
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

The
32
men
and
20
women
underwent
living
donor
liver
transplantation
.

We
started
LMWH
(
25
IU
/
kg
/
h
)
on
postoperative
day
(
POD
)
1
,
switching
to
UFH

(
5000
U
/
d
)
on
POD
2
or
3
.

The
dose
of
UFH
was
changed
according
to
the
activated
clotting
time
level
.

HIT
antibody
levels
were
measured
the
day
before
surgery
and
on
POD
7
and
14
.

Platelet
count
was
measured
daily
for
3
weeks
.

RESULTS
:

The
average
platelet
counts
preoperatively
,
and
on
POD
7
,
14
,
and
21
were
65
,
88
,
149
,
and
169
x
10(9)/L
,
respectively
.

Two
patients
developed
hepatic
artery
thrombosis
on
POD
11
and
19
,
respectively
,
although
they
were
HIT

antibody
-
negative
and
their
platelet
counts
were
stable
.

In
2
other
patients
,
the
platelet
count
decreased
suddenly
from
107
x
10(9)/L
on
POD
4
to
65
x
10(9)/L
on
POD
6
and
from
76
x
10(9)/L
on
POD
7
to
33
x
10(9)/L
on
POD
9
,
respectively
.

The
heparin
-induced
platelet
aggregation
test
was
negative
in
these
patients
.

The
percentage
of
HIT

antibody
-
positive
patients
was
0.5
%
preoperatively
,
5.6
%
on
POD
7
,
and
5.6
%
on
POD
14
.

None
of
the
subjects
/
patients
developed
UFH

-related

HIT
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
our
series
,
the
occurrence
of
HIT

after
liver
transplantation
was
uncommon
.

PTU
-associated
vasculitis
in
a
girl
with
Turner
Syndrome
and
Graves
'
disease
.

Palpable

purpura
is
a
concerning
clinical
finding
in
pediatric
patients
and
can
have
many
causes
,
including
infectious
and
autoimmune
processes
.

A
rare
cause
,
drug
-
induced
vasculitis
,
may
result
from
the
production
of
antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibodies
(
ANCAs
)
in
response
to
a
medication
.

We
report
a
girl
with
Turner
syndrome
and
Graves
'
disease
who
presented
with
palpable
purpuric
lesions
.

The
diagnosis
of
propylthiouracil

(
PTU
)
-associated

vasculitis
was
made
by
observation
of
consistent
clinical
features
,
the
detection
of
elevated
ANA
and
ANCA
in
the
blood
,
and
the
observed
clinical
resolution
of
symptoms
following
withdrawal
of
PTU
.

Subsequent
treatment
of
persistent
hyperthyroidism
with
radioablation
did
not
result
in
an
exacerbation
of
the
vasculitis
,
a
complication
described
in
prior
case
reports
.

Succinylcholine
-induced
masseter
muscle
rigidity
during
bronchoscopic
removal
of
a
tracheal
foreign
body
.

Masseter
muscle
rigidity
during
general
anesthesia
is
considered
an
early
warning
sign
of
a
possible
episode
of
malignant
hyperthermia
.

The
decision
whether
to
continue
or
discontinue
the
procedure
depends
on
the
urgency
of
the
surgery
and
severity
of
masseter
muscle
rigidity
.

Here
,
we
describe
a
case
of
severe
masseter
muscle
rigidity

(
jaw
of
steel
)
after
succinylcholine

(
Sch
)
administration
during
general
anesthetic
management
for
rigid
bronchoscopic
removal
of
a
tracheal
foreign
body
.

Anesthesia
was
continued
uneventfully
with
propofol
infusion
while
all
facilities
were
available
to
detect
and
treat
malignant
hyperthermia
.

Minor
neurological
dysfunction
,
cognitive
development
,
and
somatic
development
at
the
age
of
3
to
7
years
after
dexamethasone
treatment
in
very
-
low
birth
-
weight
infants
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
assess
minor
neurological
dysfunction
,
cognitive
development
,
and
somatic
development
after
dexamethasone
therapy
in
very
-
low
-
birthweight
infants
.

Thirty
-
three
children
after
dexamethasone
treatment
were
matched
to
33
children
without
dexamethasone
treatment
.

Data
were
assessed
at
the
age
of
3
-
7
years
.

Dexamethasone
was
started
between
the
7th
and
the
28th
day
of
life
over
7
days
with
a
total
dose
of
2.35
mg
/
kg
/
day
.

Exclusion
criteria
were
asphyxia
,
malformations
,
major
surgical
interventions
,
small
for
gestational
age
,
intraventricular
haemorrhage
grades
III
and
IV
,
periventricular
leukomalacia
,
and
severe
psychomotor
retardation
.

Each
child
was
examined
by
a
neuropediatrician
for
minor
neurological
dysfunctions
and
tested
by
a
psychologist
for
cognitive
development
with
a
Kaufman
Assessment
Battery
for
Children
and
a
Draw
-
a
-
Man
Test
.

There
were
no
differences
in
demographic
data
,
growth
,
and
socio
-
economic
status
between
the
two
groups
.

Fine
motor
skills
and
gross
motor
function
were
significantly
better
in
the
control
group
(
p<0.01
)
.

In
the
Draw
-
a
-
Man
Test
,
the
control
group
showed
better
results
(
p<0.001
)
.

There
were
no
differences
in
development
of
speech
,
social
development
,
and
the
Kaufman
Assessment
Battery
for
Children
.

After
dexamethasone
treatment
,
children
showed
a
higher
rate
of
minor
neurological
dysfunctions
.

Neurological
development
was
affected
even
without
neurological
diagnosis
.

Further
long
-
term
follow
-
up
studies
will
be
necessary
to
fully
evaluate
the
impact
of
dexamethasone
on
neurological
and
cognitive
development
.

Force
overflow
and
levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias
in
Parkinson
's
disease
.

We
assessed
force
coordination
of
the
hand
in

Parkinson
's
disease
and
its
relationship
to
motor
complications
of
levodopa
therapy
,
particularly
to
levodopa

-induced

dyskinesias

(
LID
)
.

We
studied
two
groups
of
Parkinson
's
disease
patients
with
(
Parkinson
's
disease
+
LID
,
n
=
23
)
and
without

levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias

(
Parkinson
's
disease
-
LID
,
n
=
10
)
,
and
age
-
matched
healthy
controls
.

The
motor
score
of
the
Unified
Parkinson
's
Disease

Rating
Scale
,
a
dyskinesia
score
and
force
in
a
grip
-
lift
paradigm
were
assessed
ON
and
OFF
levodopa
.

A
pathological
increase
of
forces
was
seen
in
ON
-
state
in
Parkinson
's
disease
+

LID
only
.

In
Parkinson
's
disease
+
LID
,
the
force
involved
in
pressing
down
the
object
before
lifting
was
significantly
increased
by
levodopa

(
by
61
%
,
P
0.05
)
.

An
overshooting
of
peak
grip
force
by
51
%
(
P
0.05
)
and
of
static
grip
force
by
45
%
(
P
0.01
)
was
observed
in
the
ON-
compared
with
the
OFF
-
drug
condition
.

In
contrast
,
no
excessive
force
was
found
in
Parkinson
's
disease
-
LID
.

Peak
grip
force
in
ON
-
state
was
140
%
(
P
0.05
)
higher
in
Parkinson
's
disease
+
LID
than
in
Parkinson
's
disease
-
LID
,
while
static
grip
force
was
increased
by
138
%
(
P
0.01
)
between
groups
.

Severity
of
peak
-
dose
dyskinesias
was
strongly
correlated
with
grip
force
in
ON
-
state
(
r
=
0.79
with
peak
force
,
P
0.01
)
.

No
correlation
was
observed
between
forces
and
the
motor
score
as
well
as
with
the
daily
dose
of
dopaminergic
medication
.

Force
excess
was
only
observed
in
patients
with
LID
and
motor
fluctuations
.

A
close
relationship
was
seen
between
the
overshooting
of
forces
and
dyskinesias
in
the
ON
-
drug
condition
.

We
postulate
that
both
LID
and
grip
force
excess
share
common
pathophysiological
mechanisms
related
to
motor
fluctuations
.

Postinfarction
ventricular
septal
defect
associated
with
long
-
term
steroid
therapy
.

Two
cases
of
postinfarction
ventricular
septal
rupture
in
patients
on
long
-
term
steroid
therapy
are
presented
and
the
favourable
outcome
in
both
cases
described
.

A
possible
association
between
steroid
therapy
and
subsequent
postinfarction
septal
rupture
is
discussed
.

Angioedema
associated
with
droperidol
administration
.

Angioedema
,
also
known
as
angioneurotic
edema
or
Quincke
's
disease
,
is
a
well
-
demarcated
,
localized
edema
involving
the
subcutaneous
tissues
that
may
cause
upper
-
airway
obstruction
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
previously
healthy
19-year
-
old
man
with
no
known
drug
allergies
in
whom
angioedema
with
significant
tongue
swelling
and
protrusion
developed
within
10
minutes
of
the
administration
of
a
single
IV
dose
of
droperidol
.

Clarithromycin
-associated
visual
hallucinations
in
a
patient
with
chronic
renal
failure
on
continuous
ambulatory
peritoneal
dialysis
.

Visual
hallucinations
are
a
rare
event
in
chronic
renal
failure
and
not
related
to
uremia
per
se
.

Unreported
in
the
literature
is
visual
hallucinations

occurring
in
association
with
the
new
macrolide
antibiotic
,
clarithromycin
.

We
describe
such
a
case
in
a
patient
with
end
-
stage
renal
disease

(
ESRD
)
maintained
on
continuous
ambulatory
peritoneal
dialysis
(
CAPD
)
.

The
combination
of
a
relatively
high
dose
of
clarithromycin
in
face
of
chronic
renal
failure
in
a
functionally
anephric
patient
,
with
underlying
aluminum
intoxication
,
may
have
facilitated
the
appearance
of
this
neurotoxic
side
effect
.

It
is
important
to
understand
the
pharmacokinetics
of
medications
in
face
of
chronic
renal
failure
,
the
possibility
of
drug
interactions
,
and
how
these
factors
should
help
guide
medication
therapy
in
the
ESRD
patient
.

Acute
renal
toxicity
of

doxorubicin

(
adriamycin
)
-loaded

cyanoacrylate
nanoparticles
.

Acute
doxorubicin
-loaded
nanoparticle
(
DXNP
)

renal
toxicity
was
explored
in
both
normal
rats
and
rats
with
experimental
glomerulonephritis
.

In
normal
rats
,
2/6
rats
given
free
doxorubicin

(
DX
)
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
died
within
one
week
,
whereas
all
control
animals
and
all
rats
having
received
free
NP
or
DXNP
survived
.

A
3
times
higher
proteinuria
appeared
in
animals
treated
with
DXNP
than
in
those
treated
with
DX
.

Free
NP
did
not
provoke
any
proteinuria
.

Two
hr
post
-
injection
,
DXNP
was
2.7
times
more
concentrated
in
kidneys
than
free
DX

(
p
0.025
)
.

In
rats
with
immune
experimental
glomerulonephritis
,
5/6
rats
given
DX
died
within
7
days
,
in
contrast
to
animals
treated
by
DXNP
,
NP
,
or
untreated
,
which
all
survived
.

Proteinuria
appeared
in
all
series
,
but
was
2
-
5
times
more
intense
(
p
>
0.001
)
and
prolonged
after
doxorubicin
treatment
(
400
-
700
mg
/
day
)
,
without
significant
difference
between
DXNP
and
DX
.

Rats
treated
by
unloaded
NP
behaved
as
controls
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
,
in
these
experimental
conditions
,
DXNP
killed
less
animals
than
free
DX
,
despite
of
an
enhanced
renal
toxicity
of
the
former
.

Both
effects
(
better
survival
and
nephrosis
)
are
most
probably
related
to
an
enhanced
capture
of
DXNP
by
cells
of
the
mononuclear
phagocyte
system
,
including
mesangial
cells
.

Etoposide
-related
myocardial
infarction
.

The
occurrence
of
a
myocardial
infarction
is
reported
after
chemotherapy
containing
etoposide
,
in
a
man
with
no
risk
factors
for
coronary
heart
disease
.

Possible
causal
mechanisms
are
discussed
.

Subjective
assessment
of
sexual
dysfunction
of
patients
on
long
-
term
administration
of
digoxin
.

Various
data
suggest
that
male
patients
who
have
received
digoxin
on
a
longterm
basis
have
increased
levels
of
serum
estrogen
and
decreased
levels
of
plasma
testosterone
and
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
investigate
the
links
between
the
long
-
term
administration
of
digoxin
therapy
and
sexual
behavior
,
and
the
effect
of
digoxin
on
plasma
levels
of
estradiol
,
testosterone
,
and
LH
.

The
patients
of
the
study
and
control
group
(
without
digoxin
)
were
of
similar
cardiac
functional
capacity
and
age
(
25
-
40
years
)
and
were
randomly
selected
from
the
rheumatic
heart
disease
patients
.

A
subjective
assessment
of
sexual
behavior
in
the
study
and
control
groups
was
carried
out
,
using
parameters
such
as
sexual
desire
,
sexual
excitement
,
and
frequency
of
sexual
relations
.

Personal
interviews
and
a
questionnaire
were
also
used
for
the
evaluation
of
sexual
behavior
.

The
findings
support
the
reports
concerning
digoxin
effect
on
plasma
estradiol
,
testosterone
,
and
LH
.

The
differences
in
the
means
were
significant
.

Tests
used
to
evaluate
the
changes
in
sexual
behavior
showed
a
significant
decrease
in
sexual
desire
,
sexual
excitement
phase
(
erection
)
,
and
frequency
of
sexual
relations
in
the
study
group
.

Fatal
aplastic
anemia
due
to
indomethacin
--lymphocyte
transformation
tests
in
vitro
.

Although
indomethacin
has
been
implicated
as
a
possible
cause
of
aplastic
anemia
on
the
basis
of
a
few
clinical
observations
,
its
role
has
not
been
definitely
established
.

A
case
of
fatal
aplastic
anemia
is
described
in
which
no
drugs
other
than
allopurinol
and
indomethacin
were
given
.

Indomethacin
was
first
given
four
weeks
prior
to
the
onset
of
symptoms
.

A
positive
lymphocyte
transformation
test
with
indomethacin

in
vitro
further
substantiates
the
potential
role
of
this
drug
in
causing
aplastic
anemia
in
a
susceptible
patient
.

Fortunately
,
this
seems
to
be
a
very
rare
complication
.

Plasma
and
urinary
lipids
and
lipoproteins
during
the
development
of
nephrotic
syndrome
induced
in
the
rat
by
puromycin
aminonucleoside
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
ascertain
whether
the
alterations
of
plasma
lipoproteins
found
in
nephrotic
syndrome
induced
by
puromycin
aminonucleoside
were
due
to
nephrotic
syndrome
per
se
,
or
,
at
least
in
part
,
to
the
aminonucleoside
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
changes
in
plasma
and
urinary
lipoproteins
during
the
administration
of
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
20
mg
/
kg
for
7
days
)
and
the
subsequent
development
of
nephrotic
syndrome
.

Since
massive
albuminuria
occurred
after
6
days
of
treatment
,
the
time
-
course
study
was
divided
into
two
stages
:
pre-
nephrotic
stage
(
day
1
-
5
)
and
nephrotic
stage
(
day
6
-
11
)
.

In
pre-

nephrotic
stage
the
plasma
level
of
fatty
acids
,
triacylglycerol
and
VLDL
decreased
while
that
of
phospholipid
,
cholesteryl
esters
and
HDL
remained
constant
.

Plasma
apolipoprotein

A
-
I
tended
to
increase
(
40
%
increase
at
day
5
)
.

At
the
beginning
of
nephrotic
stage
(
day
6
)
the
concentration
of
plasma
albumin
dropped
to
a
very
low
level
,
while
that
of

apolipoprotein
A
-
I
increased
abruptly
(
4-fold
increase
)
and
continued
to
rise
,
although
less
steeply
,
in
the
following
days
.

The
plasma
concentration
of
HDL
followed
the
same
pattern
.

Plasma
VLDL
and
LDL
increased
at
a
later
stage
(
day
9
)
.

Plasma
apolipoprotein

A
-
I
was
found
not
only
in
HDL
(
1.063
-
1.210
g
/
ml
)
but
also
in
the
LDL
density
class
(
1.025
-
1.050
g
/
ml
)
.

In
the
pre-

nephrotic
stage
lipoproteinuria
was
negligible
,
while
in
the
early
nephrotic
stage
the
urinary
loss
of
plasma
lipoproteins
consisted
mainly
of
HDL
.

These
observations
indicate
that
puromycin
aminonucleoside
alters
plasma
lipoproteins
by
lowering
VLDL
and
increasing
HDL
.

It
is
likely
that
the
early
and
striking
increase
of
plasma
HDL
found
in
nephrotic
rats
is
related
to
a
direct
effect
of
the
drug
on
HDL
metabolism
.

Circulating
lysosomal
enzymes
and
acute
hepatic
necrosis
.

The
activities
of
the
lysosomal
enzymes
acid
and
neutral
protease
,
N
-
acetylglucosaminidase
,
and
acid
phosphatase
were
measured
in
the
serum
of
patients
with
fulminant
hepatic
failure
.

Acid
protease
(
cathepsin
D
)
activity
was
increased
about
tenfold
in
patients
who
died
and
nearly
fourfold
in
those
who
survived
fulminant
hepatic
failure
after
paracetamol
overdose
,
whereas
activities
were
increased
equally
in
patients
with
fulminant
hepatic
failure
due
to
viral
hepatitis
whether
or
not
they
survived
.

A
correlation
was
found
between
serum
acid
protease
activity
and
prothrombin
time
,
and
the
increase
in
cathepsin
D
activity
was
sustained
over
several
days
compared
with
aspartate
aminotransferase
,
which
showed
a
sharp
early
peak
and
then
a
fall
.

Circulating
lysosomal
proteases
can
damage
other
organs
,
and
measurement
of
their
activity
may
therefore
be
of
added
value
in
assessing
prognosis
in
this
condition
.

Transketolase

Wernicke
's
encephalopathy
.

We
studied
a
thiamine
-dependent
enzyme
,
transketolase
,
from
fibroblasts
of
a
diabetic
patient
who
developed
Wernicke
's
encephalopathy
when
treated
with
tolazamide
,
in
order
to
delineate
if
this
patient
also
had
transketolase
abnormality
[
high
Km
for
thiamine
pyrophosphate

(
TPP
)
]
,
as
previously
reported
in
postalcoholic
Wernicke
-
Korsakoff
syndrome
.

In
addition
to
this
patient
,
we
also
studied
this
enzyme
from
three
diabetic
kindreds
without
any
history
of
Wernicke
's
encephalopathy
and
from
four
normal
controls
.

We
found
that
the
above
-
mentioned
patient
and
one
of
the
diabetic
kindreds
with
no
history
of
Wernicke
's
encephalopathy

had
abnormal
transketolase
as
determined
by
its
Km
for
TPP
.

These
data
suggest
a
similarity
between
postalcoholic
Wernicke
-
Korsakoff
syndrome
and
the
patient
with
tolazamide
-induced

Wernicke
's
encephalopathy
from
the
standpoint
of
transketolase
abnormality
.

Mechanisms
of
myocardial
ischemia
induced
by
epinephrine
:
comparison
with
exercise
-
induced
ischemia
.

The
role
of
epinephrine
in
eliciting
myocardial
ischemia
was
examined
in
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
.

Objective
signs
of
ischemia
and
factors
increasing
myocardial
oxygen
consumption
were
compared
during
epinephrine
infusion
and
supine
bicycle
exercise
.

Both
epinephrine
and
exercise
produced

myocardial
ischemia
as
evidenced
by
ST
segment
depression
and
angina
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
of
myocardial
ischemia
induced
by
epinephrine
were
significantly
different
from
those
of
exercise
.

Exercise
-
induced

myocardial
ischemia
was
marked
predominantly
by
increased
heart
rate
and
rate
-
pressure
product
with
a
minor
contribution
of
end
-
diastolic
volume
,
while

epinephrine
-induced
ischemia
was
characterized
by
a
marked
increase
in
contractility
and
a
less
pronounced
increase
in
heart
rate
and
rate
-
pressure
product
.

These
findings
indicate
that
ischemia
produced
by
epinephrine
,
as
may
occur
during
states
of
emotional
distress
,
has
a
mechanism
distinct
from
that
due
to
physical
exertion
.

Transient
contralateral
rotation
following
unilateral
substantia
nigra
lesion
reflects
susceptibility
of
the
nigrostriatal
system
to
exhaustion
by
amphetamine
.

Following
unilateral
6-OHDA
induced
SN
lesion
,
a
transient
period
of
contralateral
rotation
has
been
reported
to
precede
the
predominant
ipsilateral
circling
.

In
order
to
clarify
the
nature
of
this
initial
contralateral
rotation

we
examined
the
effect
of
the
duration
of
recovery
period
after
the
lesion
,
on
amphetamine

-induced

rotational
behavior
.

Three
days
post
lesion
,
most
rats
circled
predominantly
contralaterally
to
the
lesion
.

Such
contralateral
rotation
may
result
from
either
degeneration
-
induced
breakdown
of
the
DA
pool
,
or
lesion
-
induced
increase
of
DA
turnover
in
the
spared
neurons
.

A
substantial
degree
of
contralateral
preference
was
still
evident
when
amphetamine
was
administered
for
the
first
time
24
days
after
lesioning
,
indicating
involvement
of
spared
cells
in
the
contralateral
rotation
.

However
,
regardless
of
the
duration
of
recovery
(
and
irrespective
of
either
lesion
volume
,
amphetamine
dose
,
or
post
-
lesion
motor
exercise
)
,
amphetamine
-induced

rotation
tended
to
become
gradually
more
ipsilateral
as
the
observation
session
progressed
,
and
all
rats
circled
ipsilaterally
to
the
lesion
in
response
to
further
amphetamine
injections
.

These
findings
suggest
that
amphetamine
has
an
irreversible
effect
on
the
post
-
lesion
DA
pool
contributing
to
contralateral
rotation
.

Thyroid
function
and
urine
-
concentrating
ability
during
lithium
treatment
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
adenylate
cyclase
inhibition
may
be
important
in
the
development
of
both
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
and
hypothyroidism
during
lithium
treatment
.

We
measured
serum
thyroxine
and
urine
-
concentrating
ability

(
Umax
)
in
response
to
desmopressin
(
DDAVP
)
in
85
patients
receiving
lithium
.

Hypothyroidism
developed
in
eight
patients
while
they
were
taking
lithium
.

Impaired
Umax
was
found
in
both
euthyroid
and
hypothyroid
patients
while
some
hypothyroid
patients
concentrated
their
urine
well
.

It
is
concluded
that
the
dominant
mechanisms
by
which
lithium
exerts
these
two
effects
are
different
.

Sensitivity
of
erythroid
progenitor
colonies
to
erythropoietin
in
azidothymidine
treated
immunodeficient
mice
.

The
anaemia
induced
by
3'-azido-3'dideoxythymidine

(
AZT
)
is
poorly
understood
.

We
have
used
a
murine
model
of
AIDS
,
infection
of
female
C57BL/6
mice
with
LP
-
BM5
murine
leukaemia

(
MuLV
)
virus
,
to
determine
if
AZT
-induced
anaemia
is
due
,
in
part
,
to
decreased
responsiveness
of
erythropoietic
precursors
(
BFU
-
e
)
to
erythropoietin
(
EPO
)
.

Mice
in
the
early
stage
of
LP
-
BM5
MuLV
disease
were
given
AZT
in
their
drinking
water
at
1.0
and
2.5
mg
/
ml
.

AZT
produced

anaemia
in
both
groups
,
in
a
dose
-
dependent
fashion
.

Despite
the
anaemia
,
the
number
of
splenic
and
bone
marrow
BFU
-
e
in
AZT
treated
mice
increased
up
to
five
-
fold
over
levels
observed
in
infected
untreated
animals
after
15
d
of
treatment
.

Colony
formation
by
splenic
and
bone
marrow
BFUe
was
stimulated
at
lower
concentrations
of
EPO
in
mice
receiving
AZT
for
15
d
than
for
infected
,
untreated
mice
.

By
day
30
,
sensitivity
of
both
splenic
and
bone
marrow
BFU
-
e
of
treated
animals
returned
to
that
observed
from
cells
of
infected
untreated
animals
.

The
mean
plasma
levels
of
EPO
observed
in
AZT

treated
mice
were
appropriate
for
the
degree
of
anaemia
observed
when
compared
with
phenylhydrazine

(
PHZ
)
treated
mice
.

The
numbers
of
BFU
-
e
and
the
percentage
of
bone
marrow
erythroblasts
observed
were
comparable
in
AZT
and
PHZ
treated
mice
with
similar
degrees
of
anaemia
.

However
,
reticulocytosis
was
inappropriate
for
the
degree
of
anaemia
observed
in
AZT
treated
infected
mice
.

AZT
-induced
peripheral
anaemia
in
the
face
of
increased
numbers
of
BFU
-
e
and
increased
levels
of
plasma
EPO
suggest
a
lesion
in
terminal
differentiation
.

Detection
of
abnormal
cardiac
adrenergic
neuron
activity
in
adriamycin
-induced
cardiomyopathy
with
iodine-125-metaiodobenzylguanidine
.

Radiolabeled
metaiodobenzylguanidine
(
MIBG
)
,
an
analog
of
norepinephrine

(
NE
)
,
serves
as
an
index
of
adrenergic
neuron
integrity
and
function
.

Using
a
rat
model
of
adriamycin

-induced

cardiomyopathy
,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
abnormal
cardiac
adrenergic
neuron
activity
may
appear
and
be
exacerbated

dose
-
dependently
in
adriamycin
cardiomyopathy
.

The
degree
of
vacuolar
degeneration
of
myocardial
cells
was
analyzed
in
relation
to
the
duration
of
adriamycin
treatment
(
2
mg
/
kg
,
once
a
week
)
.

There
were
no
abnormalities
or
only
isolated
degeneration
in
the
1-
or
2-wk
treatment
groups
,
isolated
or
scattered
degeneration
in
half
of
the
3-wk
group
,
frequent
scattered
degeneration
in
the
4-wk
group
,
scattered
or
focal
degeneration
in
the
5-wk
group
,
and
extensive
degeneration
in
the
8-wk
group
.

Myocardial
accumulation
of
[
125I
]
MIBG
4
hr
after
intravenous
injection
did
not
differ
between
the
controls
and
the
groups
treated
3
wk
or
less
.

However
,
the
4-wk
group
had
a
slightly
lower
accumulation
in
the
right
ventricular
wall
(
82
%
of
the
control
)
and
significantly
lower
accumulation
in
the
left
ventricular
wall
(
about
66
%
of
the
control
:
p
less
than
0.05
)
.

In
the
5-wk
group
,
MIBG
accumulation
in
the
right
and
left
ventricular
wall
was
35
%
and
27
%
of
that
in
controls
,
respectively
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
.

In
the
8-wk
group
,
MIBG
accumulation
in
the
right
and
left
ventricular
wall
was
18
%
and
14
%
of
that
in
controls
,
respectively
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
.

Thus
,
MIBG
accumulation
in
the
myocardium
decreased
in
an
adriamycin
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

The
appearance
of
impaired
cardiac
adrenergic
neuron
activity
in
the
presence
of
slight
myocardial
impairment
(
scattered
or
focal
vacuolar
degeneration
)
indicates
that
MIBG
scintigraphy
may
be
a
useful
method
for
detection
of
adriamycin
-induced
cardiomyopathy
.

Amnestic
syndrome
associated
with
propranolol

toxicity
:
a
case
report
.

An
elderly
woman
developed
an
Alzheimer
-like
subacute

dementia
as
a
result
of
propranolol
toxicity
.

Analysis
of
the
manifestations
showed
that
severe
impairment
of
memory
accounted
for
virtually
all
of
the
abnormalities
.

There
is
evidence
that
cerebral
reactions
to
drug
toxicity
can
exhibit
patterns
that
suggest
highly
selective
involvement
of
functional
subdivisions
of
the
brain
.

Biphasic
response
of
the
SA
node
of
the
dog
heart
in
vivo
to
selective
administration
of
ketamine
.

Effect
of

ketamine
on
the
SA
node
of
the
dog
heart
was
studied
in
vivo
using
a
selective
perfusion
technique
of
the
SA
node
artery
.

Injections
of
ketamine
in
doses
from
100
microgram
to
3
mg
into
the
artery
produced
a
depression
of
the
SA
nodal
activity
by
a
direct
action
.

This

depression
was
followed
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
stimulatory
phase
.

Bilateral
vagotomy
and
sympathectomy
or
prior
administration
of
a
ganglion
blocker
failed
to
inhibit
the
occurrence
of
the
ketamine
-induced
tachycardia
,
while
it
was
completely
abolished
in
the
reserpinized
dogs
or
by
a
prior
injection
of
a
beta
-
blocking
agent
into
the
SA
node
artery
.

This
may
indicate
that
an
activation
of
the
peripheral
adrenergic
mechanism
plays
an
important
role
in
the
induction
of
the
excitatory
effect
of
ketamine
injected
in
the
SA
node
artery
.

The
use
of
serum
cholinesterase
in
succinylcholine

apnoea
.

Fifteen
patients
demonstrating
unexpected
prolonged
apnoea
lasting
several
hours
after
succinylcholine
have
been
treated
by
a
new
preparation
of
human
serum
cholinesterase
.

Adequate
spontaneous
respiration
was
re
-
established
in
an
average
period
of
ten
minutes
after
the
injection
.

In
12
patients
biochemical
genetic
examinations
confirmed
the
presence
of
an
atypical
serum
cholinesterase
.

In
three
patients
none
of
the
usual
variants
were
found
.

It
is
therefore
supposed
that
other
unknown
variants
of
serum
cholinesterase
exist
which
can
not
hydrolyze
succinylcholine
.

The
use
of
serum
cholinesterase
in
succinylcholine

apnoea
provided
considerable
relief
to
both
patient
and
anaesthetist
.

Studies

function
for
orthostatic

)
or
rauwolscine
(

.

Orthostatic

was
determined
by
the
average
decrease
(

in
mean

(
MAP

)
over
the
60-s

.

The

Conversely
,
administration
of

decreased
the

Computed

in
the
right
frontal

and
increased

.

Left

In

at
1-min
intervals
while
external
cardiac
compressions
were
applied
.

Resuscitation
was
considered
successful
when
a
systolic
arterial
pressure
>
or
=
100
mm
Hg
was
achieved
within
5
min
.

The
cumulative
doses
of
levobupivacaine
and
ropivacaine
that
produced
seizures
were
similar
and
were
larger
than
those
of
bupivacaine
.

The
cumulative
doses
of
levobupivacaine
that
produced
dysrhythmias
and
asystole
were
smaller
than
the
corresponding
doses
of
ropivacaine
,
but
they
were
larger
than
those
of
bupivacaine
.

The
number
of
successful
resuscitations
did
not
differ
among
groups
.

However
,
a
smaller
dose
of
epinephrine
was
required
in
the
Ropivacaine
group
than
in
the
other
groups
.

We
conclude
that
the
systemic
toxicity
of
levobupivacaine
is
intermediate
between
that
of
ropivacaine
and
bupivacaine
when
administered
at
the
same
rate
and
that

ropivacaine
-induced

cardiac
arrest
appears
to
be
more
susceptible
to
treatment
than
that
induced
by
bupivacaine
or
levobupivacaine
.

22-oxacalcitriol
suppresses

secondary
hyperparathyroidism
without
inducing
low
bone
turnover
in
dogs
with
renal
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:

Calcitriol
therapy
suppresses
serum
levels
of
parathyroid
hormone
(
PTH
)
in
patients
with
renal
failure
but
has
several
drawbacks
,
including
hypercalcemia
and/or
marked
suppression
of
bone
turnover
,
which
may
lead
to
adynamic
bone
disease
.

A
new
vitamin
D
analogue
,
22-oxacalcitriol

(
OCT
)
,
has
been
shown
to
have
promising
characteristics
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
the
effects
of
OCT
on
serum
PTH
levels
and
bone
turnover
in
states
of
normal
or
impaired
renal
function
.

METHODS
:

Sixty
dogs
were
either
nephrectomized
(
Nx
,
N
=
38
)
or
sham
-
operated
(
Sham
,
N
=
22
)
.

The
animals
received
supplemental

phosphate
to
enhance
PTH
secretion
.

Fourteen
weeks
after
the
start
of
phosphate
supplementation
,
half
of
the
Nx
and
Sham
dogs
received
doses
of
OCT

(
three
times
per
week
)
;
the
other
half
were
given
vehicle
for
60
weeks
.

Thereafter
,
the
treatment
modalities
for
a
subset
of
animals
were
crossed
over
for
an
additional
eight
months
.

Biochemical
and
hormonal
indices
of
calcium
and
bone
metabolism
were
measured
throughout
the
study
,
and
bone
biopsies
were
done
at
baseline
,
60
weeks
after
OCT
or
vehicle
treatment
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
crossover
period
.

RESULTS
:

In
Nx
dogs
,
OCT
significantly
decreased
serum
PTH
levels
soon
after
the
induction
of
renal
insufficiency
.

In
long
-
standing
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
,
OCT
(
0.03
microg
/
kg
)
stabilized
serum
PTH
levels
during
the
first
months
.

Serum
PTH
levels
rose
thereafter
,
but
the
rise
was
less
pronounced
compared
with
baseline
than
the
rise
seen
in
Nx
control
.

These
effects
were
accompanied
by
episodes
of
hypercalcemia
and
hyperphosphatemia
.

In
animals
with
normal
renal
function
,
OCT
induced
a
transient
decrease
in
serum
PTH
levels
at
a
dose
of
0.1
microg
/
kg
,
which
was
not
sustained
with
lowering
of
the
doses
.

In
Nx
dogs
,
OCT
reversed
abnormal
bone
formation
,
such
as
woven
osteoid
and
fibrosis
,
but
did
not
significantly
alter
the
level
of
bone
turnover
.

In
addition
,
OCT

improved
mineralization
lag
time
,
(
that
is
,
the
rate
at
which
osteoid
mineralizes
)
in
both
Nx
and
Sham
dogs
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
results
indicate
that
even
though
OCT
does
not
completely
prevent
the
occurrence
of
hypercalcemia
in
experimental
dogs
with
renal
insufficiency
,
it
may
be
of
use
in
the
management
of
secondary
hyperparathyroidism
because
it
does
not
induce
low
bone
turnover
and
,
therefore
,
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
adynamic
bone
disease
.

Chemotherapy
of
advanced
inoperable
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
with
paclitaxel
:
a
phase
II
trial
.

Paclitaxel

(
Taxol
;
Bristol
-
Myers
Squibb
Company
,
Princeton
,
NJ
)
has
demonstrated
significant
antineoplastic
activity
against
different
tumor
types
,
notably
ovarian
and
breast
carcinoma
.

Two
phase
II
trials
of
24-hour
paclitaxel
infusions
in
chemotherapy
-
naive
patients
with
stage
IIIB
or
IV
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer

(
NSCLC
)
reported
response
rates
of
21
%
and
24
%
.

Leukopenia
was
dose
limiting
:

as
many
as
62.5
%
of
patients
experienced
grade
4
leukopenia
.

We
investigated
the
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
a
3-hour
paclitaxel
infusion
in
a
phase
II
trial
in
patients
with
inoperable
stage
IIIB
or
IV
NSCLC
.

The
58
patients
treated
(
41
men
and
17
women
)
had
a
median
age
of
59
years
(
age
range
,
25
to
75
)
and
a
performance
status
of
0
through
2
.

Most
patients
(
72.4
%
)
had
stage
IV
NSCLC
.

Paclitaxel
225
mg
/
m2
was
infused
over
3
hours
every
3
weeks
with
standard
prophylactic
premedication
.

Of
50
patients
evaluable
for
response
,
12
(
24
%
)
had
partial
remission
,
26
(
52
%
)
had
no
change
,
and
12
had
disease
progression
(
24
%
)
.

Hematologic
toxicities
were
mild
:

only
one
patient
(
2
%
)
developed
grade
3
or
4
neutropenia
,
while
29
%
had
grade
1
or
2
.

Grade
1
or
2
polyneuropathy
affected
56
%
of
patients
while
only
one
(
2
%
)
experienced
severe
polyneuropathy
.

Similarly
,
grade
1
or
2
myalgia
/
arthralgia
was
observed
in
63.2
%
of
patients
,
but
only
14.3
%
experienced
grade
3
or
4
.

Nausea
and
vomiting
were
infrequent
,
with
14
%
of
patients
experiencing
grade
1
or
2
and
only
2
%
experiencing
grade
3
or
4
.

Paclitaxel
is
thus
an
active
single
agent
in
this
patient
population
,
with
a
3-hour
infusion
proving
comparably
effective
to
a
24-hour
infusion
and
superior
in
terms
of
the
incidence
of
hematologic
and
nonhematologic
toxicity
.

Further
phase
II
studies
with
paclitaxel
combined
with
other
drugs
active
against
NSCLC
are
indicated
,
and

phase
III
studies
comparing
paclitaxel
with
standard
chemotherapy
remain
to
be
completed
.

Cerebral
hemorrhage
associated
with
phenylpropanolamine
in
combination
with
caffeine
.

Phenylpropanolamine

(
PPA
)
is
a
drug
that
has
been
associated
with
serious
side
effects
including
stroke
.

It
is
often
combined
with
caffeine
in
diet
preparations
and
"
look
-
alike
"
pills
.

In
order
to
determine
if
PPA
/
caffeine
can
lead
to
stroke
in
normotensive
and/or
hypertensive
rats
,
we
administered
the
combination
in
six
times
the
allowed
human
dose
calculated
on
a
per
weight
basis
for
the
rats
two
times
per
day
for
five
days
.

Subarachnoid
and
cerebral
hemorrhage
was
noted
in
18
%
of
the
hypertensive
rats
.

A
single
PPA
/
caffeine
administration
(
same
dose
)
lead
to
acute
hypertension
in
both
the
normotensive
and
hypertensive
animals
.

These
results
suggest
that
PPA
/
caffeine
can
lead
to
cerebral
hemorrhage
in
previously
hypertensive
animals
when
administered
in
greater
than
the
allowed
dosage
.

An
acute
elevation
in
blood
pressure
may
be
a
contributing
factor
.

Long
-
term
efficacy
and
toxicity
of
high
-
dose
amiodarone
therapy
for
ventricular
tachycardia
or
ventricular
fibrillation
.

Amiodarone
was
administered
to
154
patients
who
had
sustained
,
symptomatic
ventricular
tachycardia
(
VT
)
(
n
=
118
)
or
a
cardiac
arrest

(
n
=
36
)
and
who
were
refractory
to
conventional
antiarrhythmic
drugs
.

The
loading
dose
was
800
mg
/
day
for
6
weeks
and
the
maintenance
dose
was
600
mg
/
day
.

Sixty
-
nine
percent
of
patients
continued
treatment
with
amiodarone
and
had
no
recurrence
of
symptomatic
VT
or
ventricular
fibrillation

(
VF
)
over
a
follow
-
up
of
6
to
52
months
(
mean
+
/-

standard
deviation
14.2
+
/-
8.2
)
.

Six
percent
of
the
patients
had
a
nonfatal
recurrence
of
VT
and
were
successfully
managed
by
continuing
amiodarone
at
a
higher
dose
or
by
the
addition
of
a
conventional
antiarrhythmic
drug
.

One
or
more
adverse
drug
reactions
occurred
in
51
%
of
patients
.

Adverse
effects
forced
a
reduction
in
the
dose
of
amiodarone
in
41
%
and
discontinuation
of
amiodarone
in
10
%
of
patients
.

The
most
common
symptomatic
adverse
reactions
were
tremor
or
ataxia
(
35
%
)
,

nausea
and
anorexia
(
8
%
)
,
visual
halos
or
blurring

(
6
%
)
,

thyroid
function
abnormalities
(
6
%
)
and
pulmonary
interstitial
infiltrates
(
5
%
)
.

Although
large
-
dose
amiodarone
is
highly
effective
in
the
long
-
term
treatment
of
VT
or
VF
refractory
to
conventional
antiarrhythmic
drugs
,
it
causes
significant
toxicity
in
approximately
50
%
of
patients
.

However
,
when
the
dose
is
adjusted
based
on
clinical
response
or
the
development
of
adverse
effects
,
75
%
of
patients
with
VT
or
VF
can
be
successfully
managed
with
amiodarone
.

Effect
of
calcium
chloride
and
4-aminopyridine
therapy
on
desipramine
toxicity
in
rats
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hypotension
is
a
major
contributor
to
mortality
in
tricyclic
antidepressant
overdose
.

Recent
data
suggest
that
tricyclic
antidepressants
inhibit
calcium
influx
in
some
tissues
.

This
study
addressed
the
potential
role
of
calcium
channel
blockade
in
tricyclic
antidepressant
-
induced
hypotension
.

METHODS
:

Two
interventions
were
studied
that
have
been
shown
previously
to
improve
blood
pressure
with
calcium
channel
blocker
overdose
.

CaCl2
and
4-aminopyridine
.

Anesthetized
rats
received
the
tricyclic
antidepressant
desipramine
IP
to
produce
hypotension
,
QRS
prolongation
,
and
bradycardia
.

Fifteen
min
later
,
animals
received
CaCl2
,
NaHCO3
,
or
saline
.

In
a
second
experiment
,
rats
received
tricyclic
antidepressant
desipramine

IP
followed
in
15
min
by
4-aminopyridine
or
saline
.

RESULTS
:

NaHCO3
briefly
(
5
min
)
reversed
hypotension
and
QRS
prolongation
.

CaCl2
and
4-aminopyridine
failed
to
improve
blood
pressure
.

The
incidence
of
ventricular
arrhythmias

(
p
=
0.004
)
and
seizures

(
p
=
0.03
)
in
the
CaCl2
group
was
higher
than
the
other
groups
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
administration
of
CaCl2
or
4-aminopyridine
did
not
reverse
tricyclic
antidepressant
-
induced
hypotension
in
rats
.

CaCl2
therapy
may
possibly
worsen
both
cardiovascular
and
central
nervous
system
toxicity
.

These
findings
do
not
support
a
role
for
calcium
channel
inhibition
in
the
pathogenesis
of
tricyclic
antidepressant
-
induced
hypotension
.

Phase
I
trial
of
13-cis
-
retinoic
acid
in
children
with
neuroblastoma

following
bone
marrow
transplantation
.

PURPOSE
:
Treatment
of
neuroblastoma
cell
lines
with
13-cis
-
retinoic
acid

(
cis
-
RA
)
can
cause
sustained
inhibition
of
proliferation
.

Since
cis
-
RA
has
demonstrated
clinical
responses
in
neuroblastoma
patients
,
it
may
be
effective
in
preventing
relapse
after
cytotoxic
therapy
.

This
phase
I
trial
was
designed
to
determine
the
maximal
-
tolerated
dosage
(
MTD
)
,
toxicities
,
and
pharmacokinetics
of
cis
-
RA
administered
on
an
intermittent
schedule
in
children
with
neuroblastoma

following
bone
marrow
transplantation
(
BMT
)
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

Fifty
-
one
assessable
patients
,
2
to
12
years
of
age
,
were
treated
with
oral
cis
-
RA
administered
in
two
equally
divided
doses
daily
for
2
weeks
,
followed
by
a
2-week
rest
period
,
for
up
to
12
courses
.

The
dose
was
escalated
from
100
to
200
mg
/
m2/d
until
dose
-
limiting
toxicity

(
DLT
)
was
observed
.

A
single
intrapatient
dose
escalation
was
permitted
.

RESULTS
:

The
MTD
of
cis
-
RA
was
160
mg
/
m2/d
.

Dose
-
limiting

toxicities
in
six
of
nine
patients
at
200
mg
/
m2/d
included
hypercalcemia

(
n
=
3
)
,

rash
(
n
=
2
)
,
and
anemia
/
thrombocytopenia
/
emesis
/
rash
(
n
=
1
)
.

All
toxicities
resolved
after
cis
-
RA
was
discontinued
.

Three
complete
responses
were
observed
in
marrow
metastases
.

Serum
levels
of
7.4
+
/-

3.0
mumol
/
L
(
peak
)
and
4.0
+
/-

2.8
mumol
/
L
(
trough
)
at
the
MTD
were
maintained
during
14
days
of
therapy
.

The
DLT
correlated
with
serum
levels
>
or
=
10
mumol
/
L.
CONCLUSION
:
The
MTD
of
cis
-
RA
given
on
this
intermittent
schedule

was
160
mg
/
m2/d
.

Serum
levels
known
to
be
effective
against
neuroblastoma
in
vitro
were
achieved
at
this
dose
.

The
DLT
included
hypercalcemia
,
and
may
be
predicted
by
serum
cis
-
RA
levels
.

Monitoring
of
serum
calcium
and
cis
-
RA
levels
is
indicated
in
future
trials
.

Effect
of
calcium
chloride
on
gross
behavioural
changes
produced
by
carbachol
and
eserine
in
cats
.

The
effect
of
calcium
chloride
injected
into
the
cerebral
ventricles
of
group
-
housed
unanaesthetized
cats
upon
vocalization
(
rage
,
hissing
and
snarling
)
,
fighting
(
attack
with
paws
and
claws
,
defense
with
paws
and
claws
and
biting
)
,
mydriasis
,
tremor
and
clonic
-
tonic
convulsions
produced
by
carbachol
and
eserine
injected
similarly
was
investigated
.

Calcium
chloride
depressed
or
almost
completely
abolished
the
vocalization
and
fighting
due
to
carbachol
and
eserine
.

On
the
other
hand
,
mydriasis
,

tremor
and
clonic
-
tonic
convulsions
evoked
by
carbachol
and
eserine
were
not
significantly
changed
by
calcium
chloride
.

It
is
apparent
that
calcium
chloride
can
"
dissociate
"
vocalization
and
fighting
from
autonomic
and
motor
phenomena
such
as
mydriasis
,
tremor
and
clonic
-
tonic
convulsions
caused
by
carbachol
and
eserine
.

Calcium
chloride
inhibited
the
vocalization
and
fighting
produced
by
carbachol
and
eserine
most
probably
by
a
nonspecific
stabilizing
action
on
central
muscarinic
cholinoceptive
sites
.

These
results
further
support
the
view
that
calcium
ions
in
excess
have
an
atropine
-like
action
also
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

Multiple
side
effects
of
penicillamine
therapy
in
one
patient
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Skin
rashes
,
proteinuria
,
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
,
polymyositis
and
myasthenia
gravis
have
all
been
recorded
as
complications
of
penicillamine
therapy
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

A
patient
who
had
developed
all
5
is
now
described
.

The
skin
lesion
resembled
elastosis
perforans
serpiginosa
,
which
has
been
reported
as
a
rare
side
effect
in
patients
with
Wilson
's
disease
but
not
in
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
treated
with
penicillamine
.

Electrocardiographic
changes
and
cardiac
arrhythmias
in
patients
receiving
psychotropic
drugs
.

Eight
patients
had
cardiac
manifestations
that
were
life
-
threatening
in
five
while
taking
psychotropic
drugs
,
either
phenothiazines
or
tricyclic
antidepressants
.

Although
most
patients
were
receiving
several
drugs
,
Mellaril

(
thioridazine
)
appeared
to
be
responsible
for
five
cases
of
ventricular
tachycardia
,
one
of
which
was
fatal
in
a
35
year
old
woman
.

Supraventricular
tachycardia
developed
in
one
patient
receiving
Thorazine

(
chlorpromazine
)
.

Aventyl

(
nortriptyline
)
and
Elavil

(
amitriptyline
)

each
produced
left
bundle
branch
block
in
a
73
year
old
woman
.

Electrocardiographic
T
and
U
wave
abnormalities
were
present
in
most
patients
.

The
ventricular
arrhythmias
responded
to
intravenous
administration
of
lidocaine
and
to
direct
current
electric
shock
;
ventricular
pacing
was
required
in
some
instances
and
intravenous
administration
of
propranolol
combined
with
ventricular
pacing
in
one
.

The
tachyarrhythmias
generally
subsided
within
48
hours
after
administration
of
the
drugs
was
stopped
.

Five
of
the
eight
patients
were
50
years
of
age
or
younger
;
only
one
clearly
had
antecedent
heart
disease
.

Major
cardiac
arrhythmias
are
a
potential
hazard
in
patients
without
heart
disease
who
are
receiving
customary
therapeutic
doses
of
psychotropic
drugs
.

A
prospective
clinical
trial
is
suggested
to
quantify
the
risk
of
cardiac
complications
to
patients
receiving
phenothiazines
or
tricyclic
antidepressant
drugs
.

Serotonergic
drugs
,
benzodiazepines
and
baclofen
block
muscimol
-induced
myoclonic
jerks
in
a
strain
of
mice
.

In
male
Swiss
mice
,
muscimol
produced
myoclonic
jerks
.

A
3
mg
/
kg
(
i.p
.
)

dose
induced
this
response
in
all
of
the
mice
tested
and
the
peak
response
of
73
jerks
per
min
was
observed
between
27
and
45
min
.

Increasing
the
brain

serotonin
levels
by
the
administration
of
5-hydroxytryptophan

(
80
-
160
mg
/
kg
)
in
combination
with
a
peripheral
decarboxylase
inhibitor
resulted
in
an
inhibition
of
the
muscimol
effect
.

However
,
in
a
similar
experiment
l
-
dopa

(
80
-
160
mg
/
kg
)
was
without
effect
.

In
doses
of
3
-
10
mg
/
kg
,
the
serotonin
receptor
agonist
MK-212
caused
a
dose
-
dependent
blockade
of
the
response
of
muscimol
.

Of
the
benzodiazepines
,
clonazepam
(
0.1
-
0.3
mg
/
kg
)
was
found
to
be
several
fold
more
potent
than
diazepam
(
0.3
-
3
mg
/
kg
)
in
blocking
the
myoclonic
jerks
.

While
(
-)-
baclofen
(
1
-
3
mg
/
kg
)
proved
to
be
an
effective
antagonist
of
muscimol
,
its
(
+
)
-isomer
(
5
-
20
mg
/
kg
)
lacked
this
property
.

Considering
the
fact
that
5-HTP
and
the
benzodiazepines
have
been
found
to
be
beneficial
in
the
management
of
clinical
myoclonus
,
the
muscimol
-induced
myoclonus
seems
to
be
a
satisfactory
animal
model
that
may
prove
useful
for
the
development
of
new
drug
treatments
for
this
condition
.

Our
present
study
indicated
the
possible
value
of
MK-212
and

(

baclofen
in
the
management
of
clinical
myoclonus
.

Hyperglycemic
acidotic
coma
and
death
in
Kearns
-
Sayre
syndrome
.

This
paper
presents
the
clinical
and
metabolic
findings
in
two
young
boys
with
long
-
standing
Kearns
-
Sayre
syndrome
.

Following
short
exposure
to
oral
prednisone
,
both
boys
developed
lethargy
,
increasing
somnolence
,
polydipsia
,
polyphagia
,
and
polyuria
.

Both
presented
in
the
emergency
room
with
profound
coma
,
hypotension
,
severe
hyperglycemia
,
and
acidosis
.

Nonketotic
lactic
acidosis
was
present
in
one
and
ketosis
without
a
known
serum

lactate
level
was
present
in
the
other
.

Respiratory
failure
rapidly
ensued
and
both
patients
expired
in
spite
of
efforts
at
resuscitation
.

We
believe
these
two
cases
represent
a
newly
described
and
catastrophic
metabolic
-
endocrine
failure
in
the
Kearns
-
Sayre
syndrome
.

Effects
of
active
constituents
of
Crocus
sativus
L.
,
crocin
on
streptozocin
-induced
model
of
sporadic
Alzheimer
's
disease
in
male
rats
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
involvement
of
water
-
soluble
carotenoids
,
crocins
,
as
the
main
and
active
components
of
Crocus
sativus
L.
extract
in
learning
and
memory
processes
has
been
proposed
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
effect
of
crocins
on
sporadic
Alzheimer
's
disease
induced
by
intracerebroventricular
(
icv
)
streptozocin

(
STZ
)
in
male
rats
was
investigated
.

METHODS
:

Male
adult
Wistar
rats
(
n
=
90
and
260
-
290
g
)
were
divided
into
1
,
control
;
2
and
3
,
crocins
(
15
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
;
4
,
STZ
;
5
and
6
,
STZ
+
crocins
(
15
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
groups
.

In
Alzheimer
's
disease
groups
,
rats
were
injected
with
STZ
-icv
bilaterally
(
3
mg
/
kg
)
in
first
day
and
3
days
later
,
a
similar
STZ
-icv
application
was
repeated
.

In
STZ
+
crocin
animal
groups
,
crocin
was
applied
in
doses
of
15
and
30
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.

,
one
day

pre
-
surgery
and
continued
for
three
weeks
.

Prescription
of
crocin
in
each
dose
was
repeated
once
for
two
days
.

However
,
the
learning
and
memory
performance
was
assessed
using
passive
avoidance
paradigm
,
and
for
spatial
cognition
evaluation
,
Y
-
maze
task
was
used
.

RESULTS
:

It
was
found
out
that
crocin

(
30
mg
/
kg)-treated

STZ
-injected
rats
show
higher
correct
choices
and
lower
errors
in
Y
-
maze
than
vehicle
-
treated
STZ
-injected
rats
.

In
addition
,
crocin
in
the
mentioned
dose
could
significantly
attenuated
learning
and
memory
impairment
in
treated
STZ
-injected
group
in
passive
avoidance
test
.

CONCLUSION
:

Therefore
,
these
results
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
crocin

(
30
mg
/
kg
)
in
antagonizing
the
cognitive
deficits

caused
by

STZ
-icv
in
rats
and
its
potential
in
the
treatment
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
such
as
Alzheimer
's
disease
.

Rosaceiform
dermatitis
associated
with
topical
tacrolimus
treatment
.

We
describe
herein
3
patients
who
developed
rosacea
-like

dermatitis

eruptions
while
using
0.03
%
or
0.1
%
tacrolimus
ointment
for
facial
dermatitis
.

Skin
biopsy
specimens
showed

telangiectasia
and
noncaseating
epithelioid
granulomatous
tissue
formation
in
the
papillary
to
mid
dermis
.

Continuous
topical
use
of
immunomodulators
such
as
tacrolimus
or
pimecrolimus
should
be
regarded
as
a
potential
cause
of
rosaceiform
dermatitis
,
although
many
cases
have
not
been
reported
.

A
novel
animal
model
to
evaluate
the
ability
of
a
drug
delivery
system
to
promote
the
passage
through
the
BBB
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
explore
the
potentiality
of
a
novel
animal
model
to
be
used
for
the
in
vivo
evaluation
of
the
ability
of
a
drug
delivery
system
to
promote
the
passage
through
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
and/or
to
improve
the
brain
localization
of
a
bioactive
compound
.

A
Tween
80-coated
poly
-
L
-
lactid
acid
nanoparticles
was
used
as
a
model
of
colloidal
drug
delivery
system
,
able
to
trespass
the
BBB
.

Tacrine
,
administered
in
LiCl
pre
-
treated
rats
,
induces
electrocorticographic
seizures
and
delayed
hippocampal
damage
.

The
toxic
effects
of
tacrine
-loaded
poly
-
L
-
lactid
acid
nanoparticles
(
5mg
/
kg
)
,
a
saline
solution
of
tacrine

(
5mg
/
kg
)
and
an
empty
colloidal
nanoparticle
suspension
were
compared
following
i.p
.

administration
in
LiCl

-pre
-
treated
Wistar
rats
.

All
the
animals
treated
with
tacrine

-loaded
nanoparticles
showed
an
earlier
outcome
of
CNS
adverse
symptoms
,
i.e.
epileptic
onset
,
with
respect
to
those
animals
treated
with
the
free
compound
(
10
min
vs.
22
min
respectively
)
.

In
addition
,
tacrine
-loaded
nanoparticles
administration
induced
damage
of
neuronal
cells
in
CA1
field
of
the
hippocampus
in
all
treated
animals
,
while
the
saline
solution
of
tacrine
only
in
60
%
of
animals
.

Empty
nanoparticles
provided
similar
results
to
control
(
saline
-
treated
)
group
of
animals
.

In
conclusion
,
the
evaluation
of
time
-
to
-
onset
of
symptoms
and
the
severity
of
neurodegenerative
processes
induced
by
the
tacrine
-
lithium
model
of
epilepsy
in
the
rat
,
could
be
used
to
evaluate
preliminarily
the
capability
of
a
drug
delivery
system
to
trespass
(
or
not
)
the
BBB
in
vivo
.

The
antiarrhythmic
effect
and
possible
ionic
mechanisms
of
pilocarpine
on
animal
models
.

This
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
pilocarpine
and
explore
the
underlying
ionic
mechanism
,
using
both
aconitine
-induced
rat
and
ouabain
-induced
guinea
pig
arrhythmia
models
.

Confocal
microscopy
was
used
to
measure
intracellular
free-
calcium
concentrations
(
[
Ca
(
2+)](i
)
)
in
isolated
myocytes
.

The
current
data
showed
that
pilocarpine
significantly
delayed
onset
of
arrhythmias
,
decreased
the
time
course
of
ventricular
tachycardia
and
fibrillation
,
reduced
arrhythmia
score
,
and
increased
the
survival
time
of
arrhythmic
rats
and
guinea
pigs
.

[
Ca
(
2+)](i
)
overload
induced
by
aconitine
or
ouabain
was
reduced
in
isolated
myocytes
pretreated
with
pilocarpine
.

Moreover
,
M(3)-muscarinic
acetylcholine
receptor
(
mAChR
)
antagonist
4-DAMP

(
4-diphenylacetoxy
-
N
-
methylpiperidine
-
methiodide
)
partially
abolished
the
beneficial
effects
of
pilocarpine
.

These
data
suggest
that
pilocarpine
produced
antiarrhythmic
actions
on
arrhythmic
rat
and
guinea
pig
models
induced
by
aconitine
or
ouabain
via
stimulating
the
cardiac

M(3)-mAChR.

The
mechanism
may
be
related
to
the
improvement
of
Ca

Disulfiram
-induced
transient
optic
and
peripheral
neuropathy
:
a
case
report
.

AIM
:
To
report
a
case
of
optic
and
peripheral
neuropathy
after
chronic
use
of
disulfiram
for
alcohol
dependence
management
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

A
case
report
.

RESULTS
:

A
57-year
-
old
male
presented
with
gradual
loss
of
vision
in
both
eyes
with
intermittent
headaches
for
2
months
.

He
also
complained
of
paraesthesia
with
numbness
in
both
feet
.

His
vision
was
6/15
and
2/60
in
the
right
and
left
eyes
,
respectively
.

Fundoscopy
revealed
bilaterally
swollen
optic
nerve
heads
.

Visual
field
testing
confirmed
bilateral
central
-
caecal
scotomata
.

He
had
been
taking
disulfiram
for
alcohol
dependence
for
the
preceding
3
years
.

Disulfiram
discontinuation
lead
to
an
immediate
symptomatic
improvement
.

CONCLUSION
:

Physicians
initiating
long
-
term
disulfiram
therapy
should
be
aware
of
these
adverse
effects
.

They
should
recommend
annual
ophthalmic
reviews
with
visual
field
testing
.

Patients
should
be
reassured
with
respect
to
the
reversibility
of
these
adverse
effects
.

Sustained
clinical
improvement
of
a
patient
with
decompensated
hepatitis
B
virus
-
related
cirrhosis
after
treatment
with
lamivudine
monotherapy
.

Hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
infection
,
which
causes
liver
cirrhosis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
,
remains
a
major
health
problem
in
Asian
countries
.

Recent
development
of
vaccine
for
prevention
is
reported
to
be
successful
in
reducing
the
size
of
chronically
infected
carriers
,
although
the
standard
medical
therapies
have
not
been
established
up
to
now
.

In
this
report
,
we
encountered
a
patient
with
decompensated
HBV
-
related
cirrhosis
who
exhibited
the
dramatic
improvements
after
antiviral
therapy
.

The
patient
was
a
50-year
-
old
woman
.

Previous
conventional
medical
treatments
were
not
effective
for
this
patient
,
thus
this
patient
had
been
referred
to
our
hospital
.

However
,
the
administration
of
lamivudine
,
a
reverse
transcriptase
inhibitor
,
for
23
months
dramatically
improved
her
liver
severity
.

During
this
period
,
no
drug
resistant
mutant
HBV
emerged
,
and
the
serum
HBV
-
DNA
level
was
continuously
suppressed
.

These
virological
responses
were
also
maintained
even
after
the
antiviral
therapy
was
discontinued
.

Moreover
,
both
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen
and
e
antigen
were
observed
to
have
disappeared
in
this
patient
.

The
administration
of
lamivudine
to
patients
with
HBV
-
related
cirrhosis
,
like
our
present
case
,
should
be
considered
as
an
initial
medical
therapeutic
option
,
especially
in
countries
where
liver
transplantation
is
not
reliably
available
.

Dual
effects
of
melatonin
on
barbiturate
-induced
narcosis
in
rats
.

Melatonin
affects
the
circadian
sleep

/
wake
cycle
,
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
it
may
influence
drug
-
induced
narcosis
.

Sodium
thiopenthal
was
administered
intraperitoneally
into
male
rats
pre
-
treated
with
melatonin
(
0.05
,
0.5
,
5
and
50
mg
/
kg
)
.

Melatonin

pre
-
treatment
affected
in
a
dual
manner
barbiturate
narcosis
,
however
,
no
dose
-
effect
correlation
was
found
.

In
particular
,
low
doses
reduced
the
latency
to
and
prolonged
the
duration
of
barbiturate
narcosis
.

In
contrast
,
the
highest
dose
of
melatonin

(
50
mg
/
kg
)
caused
a
paradoxical
increase
in
the
latency
and
produced
a
sustained
reduction
of
the
duration
of
narcosis
,
and
a
reduction
in
mortality
rate
.

Melatonin
0.5
and
5
mg
/
kg
influenced
the
duration
but
not
the
latency
of
ketamine
-
or
diazepam
-induced

narcosis
.

Thus
,
the
dual
action
of
melatonin
on
pharmacological
narcosis
seems
to
be
specific
for
the
barbiturate
mechanism
of
action
.

Effects
of
NIK-247
on
cholinesterase
and
scopolamine

-induced

amnesia
.

The
effects
of
NIK-247
on
cholinesterase
,
scopolamine
-induced
amnesia
and
spontaneous
movement
were
examined
and
compared
with
those
of
the
well
-
known
cholinesterase
inhibitors
tacrine
and
E-2020
.

NIK-247
,

tacrine
and
E-2020
all
strongly
inhibited
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
in
human
red
blood
cells
(
IC50s
=
1.0
x
10(-6
)
,
2.9
x
10(-7
)
and
3.7
x
10(-8

)
M
,
respectively
)
.

In
addition
,
NIK-247
and
tacrine
,
but
not
E-2020
,
strongly
inhibited
butyrylcholinestrase
(
BuChE
)
in
human
serum
.

All
three
drugs
produced
mixed
inhibition
of
AChE
activity
.

Moreover
,
the
inhibitory
effect
of
NIK-247
on
AChE
was
reversible
.

All
compounds
at
0.1
-
1
mg
/
kg
p.o
.

significantly
improved
the
amnesia
induced
by
scopolamine

(
0.5
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)

in
rats
performing
a
passive
avoidance
task
.

The
three
compounds
at
1
and
3
mg
/
kg
p.o
.

did
not
significantly
decrease
spontaneous
movement
by
rats
.

These
findings
suggest
that
NIK-247
at
a
low
dose
(
0.1
-
1
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
)
improves

scopolamine
-induced

amnesia
but
does
not
affect
spontaneous
movement
.

The
findings
suggest
that
NIK-247
may
be
a
useful
drug
for
the
treatment
of
Alzheimer
's
disease
.

Nightmares
and
hallucinations
after
long
-
term
intake
of
tramadol
combined
with
antidepressants
.

Tramadol
is
a
weak
opioid
with
effects
on
adrenergic
and
serotonergic
neurotransmission
that
is
used
to
treat
cancer
pain
and
chronic
non
malignant
pain
.

This
drug
was
initiated
in
association
with
paroxetine
and
dosulepine
hydrochloride
in
a
tetraparetic
patient
with
chronic
pain
.

Fifty
-
six
days
after
initiation
of
the
treatment
the
patient
presented
hallucinations
that
only
stopped
after
the
withdrawal
of
psycho
-
active
drugs
and
tramadol
.

The
case
report
questions
the
long
term
use
of
pain
killers
combined
with
psycho
-
active
drugs
in
chronic
non
malignant
pain
,
especially
if
pain
is
under
control
.

Apparent
cure
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
by
bone
marrow
transplantation
.

We
describe
the
induction
of
sustained
remissions
and
possible
cure
of
severe
erosive
rheumatoid
arthritis

(
RA
)
by
bone
marrow
transplantation
(
BMT
)
in
2
patients
.

BMT
was
used
to
treat
severe
aplastic
anemia
which
was
caused
by
gold
in
one
case
and
D
-
penicillamine
in
the
other
.

In
the
8
and
6
years
since
the
transplants
(
representing
8
and
4
years
since
cessation
of
all
immunosuppressive
therapy
,
respectively
)
,
the
RA
in
each
case
has
been
completely
quiescent
.

Although
short
term
remission
of
severe
RA
following
BMT
has
been
reported
,
these
are
the
first
cases
for
which
prolonged
followup
has
been
available
.

This
experience
raises
the
question
of
the
role
of
BMT
itself
as
a
therapeutic
option
for
patients
with
uncontrolled
destructive
synovitis
.

Urinary
enzymes
and
protein
patterns
as
indicators
of
injury
to
different
regions
of
the
kidney
.

Acute
experimental
models
of
renal
damage
to
the
proximal
tubular
,
glomerular
,
and
papillary
regions
of
the
rat
were
produced
by
administration
of
hexachloro-1:3-butadiene

(
HCBD
)
,
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)
,
and
2-bromoethylamine
(
BEA
)
,
respectively
.

Several
routine
indicators
of
nephrotoxicity
,
the
enzymes
alkaline
phosphatase
and
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
glucosaminidase
,
and
the
molecular
weight
of
protein
excretion
were
determined
on
urine
samples
.

Tubular
damage
produced
by
HCBD
or
BEA
was
discriminated
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
from
glomerular
damage
produced
by
PAN
.

The
latter
was
characterized
by
a
pronounced
increase
in
protein
excretion
,
especially
proteins
with
molecular
weight
greater
than
40,000
Da
.

In
contrast
,
protein
excretion
in
tubular
damage
was
raised
only
slightly
and
characterized
by
excretion
of
proteins
of
a
wide
range
of
molecular
weights
.

Proximal
tubular
damage
caused
by
HCBD
and
papillary
damage
caused
by
BEA
were
distinguished
both
by
conventional
urinalysis
(
volume
and
specific
gravity
)
and
by
measurement
of
the
two
urinary
enzymes
.

Alkaline
phosphatase
and
glucose
were
markedly
and
transiently
elevated
in
proximal
tubular
damage
and
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
glucosaminidase
showed
a
sustained
elevation
in
papillary
damage
.

It
is
concluded
that
both
selective
urinary
enzymes
and
the
molecular
weight
pattern
of
urinary
proteins
can
be
used
to
provide
diagnostic
information
about
the
possible
site
of
renal
damage
.

Neuromuscular
blockade
with
magnesium
sulfate
and
nifedipine
.

A
patient
who
received
tocolysis
with
nifedipine
developed

neuromuscular
blockade
after
500
mg
of

magnesium
sulfate
was
administered
.

This
reaction
demonstrates
that
nifedipine
can
seriously
potentiate
the
toxicity
of
magnesium
.

Caution
should
be
exercised
when
these
two
tocolytics
are
combined
.

Ifosfamide
continuous
infusion
without
mesna
.

A
phase
I
trial
of
a
14-day
cycle
.

Twenty
patients
received
27
courses
of
ifosfamide
administered
as
a
24-hour
continuous
infusion
for
14
days
without
Mesna
.

The
goal
of
the
study
was
to
deliver
a
dose
rate
and
total
cumulative
dose
of
ifosfamide
that
would
be
comparable
to
standard
bolus
or
short
-
term
infusions
administered
with
Mesna
.

Dose
escalations
proceeded
from
200
to
300
,
400
,
450
,
500
,
and
550
mg
/
m2/d
.

Four
patients
developed
transient
microscopic

hematuria
at
400
,
450
,
and
500
mg
/
m2/d
.

There
were
no
instances
of
macroscopic
hematuria
.

At
550
mg
/
m2/d
,
three
patients
experienced
nonurologic
toxicity
;
confusion
(
1
)
,
nausea

(
1
)
,
and
Grade
2
leukopenia
(
1
)
.

The
recommended
dose
of
500
mg
/
m2/d
delivers
a
total
dose
of
7
g
/
m2
per
cycle
,
which
is
comparable
to
that
delivered
in
clinical
practice
for
bolus
or
short
-
term
infusion
.

Because
few
patients
received
multiple
courses
over
time
,
the
cumulative
effects
are
indeterminate
in
the
present
trial
.

The
frequency
and
predictability
of
hematuria
are
not
precise
,
and
at
least
daily
monitoring
by
urine
Hematest
is
essential
,
adding
Mesna
to
the
infusate
in
patients
with
persistent
hematuria
.

The
protracted
infusion
schedule
for
ifosfamide
permits
convenient
outpatient
administration
without
Mesna
and
reduces
the
drug
cost
of
clinical
usage
of
this
agent
by
up
to
890
per
cycle
.

Clinical
activity
was
demonstrated
in
a
single
patient
,
but
a
comparative
trial
of
standard
bolus
schedules
with
the
protracted
infusion
schedule
will
be
necessary
to
determine
if
the
clinical
effectiveness
of
the
drug
is
maintained
.

Myocardial
infarction
in
pregnancy
associated
with
clomiphene
citrate
for
ovulation
induction
:
a
case
report
.

BACKGROUND
:

Clomiphene
citrate

(
CC
)
is
commonly
prescribed
for
ovulation
induction
.

It
is
considered
safe
,
with
minimal
side
effects
.

Thromboembolism
is
a
rare
but
life
-
threatening
complication
that
has
been
reported
after
ovulation
induction
with
CC
.

Spontaneous
coronary
thrombosis
or
thromboembolism
with
subsequent
clot
lysis
has
been
suggested
as
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
myocardial
infarction

(
MI
)
during
pregnancy
,
with
a
subsequently
normal
coronary
angiogram
.

CASE
:

A
33-year
-
old
woman
with
a
5-week
gestation
had
recently
received
CC
for
ovulation
induction
and
presented
with
chest
pain
.

An
electrocardiogram
showed
a
lateral
and
anterior
wall
myocardial
infarction
.

Cardiac
enzymes
showed
a
peak
rise
in
troponin

I
to
9.10
ng
/
mL.

An
initial
exercise
stress
test
was
normal
.

At
the
time
of
admission
,
the
patient
was
at
high
risk
of
radiation
injury
to
the
fetus
,
so
a
coronary
angiogram
was
postponed
until
the
second
trimester
.

It
showed
normal
coronary
vessels
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
appears
to
be
the
first
reported
case
documenting
a
possible
association
between
CC
and
myocardial
infarction
.

Thrombosis
might
be
a
rare
but
hazardous
complication
of
CC
.

Given
this
life
-
threatening
complication
,
appropriate
prophylactic
measures
should
be
used
in
high
-
risk
woman
undergoing
ovarian
stimulation
.

Hepatonecrosis
and
cholangitis
related
to
long
-
term
phenobarbital
therapy
:
an
autopsy
report
of
two
patients
.

Phenobarbital

(
PB
)
has
a
reputation
for
safety
,
and
it
is
commonly
believed
that
PB

-related
increases
in
serum
aminotransferase
levels
do
not
indicate
or
predict
the
development
of
significant
chronic
liver
disease
.

Here
we
report
of
two
adult
patients
with
a
long
history
of

epilepsy
treated
with
PB
who
died
suddenly
:
one
as
consequence
of
cardiac
arrest
,
the
other
of
acute
bronchopneumonia
.

At
autopsy
,
analysis
of
liver
parenchyma
revealed
rich
portal
inflammatory
infiltrate
,
which
consisted
of
mixed
eosinophil
and
monocyte
cells
,
associated
with
several
foci
of
necrosis
surrounded
by
a
hard
ring
of
non
-
specific
granulomatous
tissue
.

Inflammatory
reactions
of
internal
and
external
hepatic
biliary
ducts
were
also
seen
.

Our
findings
illustrate
that
PB
may
be
associated
with
chronic
liver
damage
,
which
may
lead
to
more
serious
and
deleterious
consequences
.

For
this
reason
,
each
clinician
should
recognize
this
entity
in
the
differential
diagnosis
of
PB
-related
asymptomatic
chronic
hepatic
enzyme
dysfunction
.

Ethambutol
-associated
optic
neuropathy
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Ethambutol
is
used
in
the
treatment
of
tuberculosis
,
which
is
still
prevalent
in
Southeast
Asia
,
and
can
be
associated
with
permanent
visual
loss
.

We
report
3
cases
which
presented
with
bitemporal
hemianopia
.

CLINICAL
PICTURE
:

Three
patients
with
ethambutol

-associated

toxic
optic
neuropathy
are
described
.

All
3
patients
had
loss
of
central
visual
acuity
,
colour
vision
(
Ishihara
)
and
visual
field
.

The
visual
field
loss
had
a
bitemporal
flavour
,
suggesting
involvement
of
the
optic
chiasm
.

TREATMENT
:

Despite
stopping
ethambutol
on
diagnosis
,
visual
function
continued
to
deteriorate
for
a
few
months
.

Subsequent
improvement
was
mild
in
2
cases
.

In
the
third
case
,
visual
acuity
and
colour
vision
normalised
but
the
optic
discs
were
pale
.

OUTCOME
:

All
3
patients
had
some
permanent
loss
of
visual
function
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Ethambutol
usage
is
associated
with
permanent
visual
loss
and
should
be
avoided
if
possible
or
used
with
caution
and
proper
ophthalmological
follow
-
up
.

The
author
postulates
that
in
cases
of
ethambutol
associated
chiasmopathy
,
ethambutol
may
initially
affect
the
optic
nerves
and
subsequently
progress
to
involve
the
optic
chiasm
.

Tolerability
of
nimesulide
and
paracetamol
in
patients
with
NSAID

-induced

urticaria
/
angioedema
.

Previous
studies
evaluated
the
tolerance
of
nimesulide
and
paracetamol
in
subjects
with
cutaneous
,
respiratory
and
anaphylactoid
reactions
induced
by
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs

(
NSAIDs
)
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
tolerability
and
reliability
of
nimesulide
and
paracetamol
in
a
very
large
number
of
patients
with
an
exclusive
well
-
documented
history
of
NSAID

-induced

urticaria
/
angioedema
.

Furthermore
,
we
evaluated
whether
some
factors
have
the
potential
to
increase
the
risk
of
reaction
to
paracetamol
and
nimesulide
.

A
single
-
placebo
-
controlled
oral
challenge
procedure
with
nimesulide
or
paracetamol
was
applied
to
829
patients
with
a
history
of
NSAID

-induced

urticaria
/
angioedema
.

A
total
of
75/829
(
9.4
%
)

patients
experienced
reactions
to
nimesulide
or
paracetamol
.

Of
the
715
patients
tested
with
nimesulide
62
(
8.6
%
)
showed
a
positive
test
,
while
of
114
subjects
submitted
to
the
challenge
with
paracetamol
,
13
(
9.6
%
)
did
not
tolerate
this
drug
.

Furthermore
,
18.28
%
of
patients
with
a
history
of
chronic
urticaria
and
11.8
%
of
subjects
with
an
history
of
NSAID
-induced
urticaria
/
angioedema
or
angioedema
alone
(
with
or
without
chronic
urticaria
)
resulted
to
be
intolerant
to
alternative
drugs
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
confirm
the
good
tolerability
of
nimesulide
and
paracetamol
in
patients
who
experienced
urticaria
/
angioedema
caused
by
NSAIDs
.

However
,
the
risk
of
reaction
to
these
alternative
study
drugs
is
statistically
increased
by
a
history
of
chronic
urticaria
and
,
above
all
,
by
a
history
of
NSAID

-induced

angioedema
.

Effects
of
verapamil
on
atrial
fibrillation
and
its
electrophysiological
determinants
in
dogs
.

BACKGROUND
:

Atrial
tachycardia
-induced
remodeling
promotes
the
occurrence
and
maintenance
of
atrial
fibrillation

(
AF
)
and
decreases
L
-
type
Ca
(
2
+
)
current
.

There
is
also
a
clinical
suggestion
that
acute
L
-
type
Ca
(
2
)
channel
blockade
can
promote
AF
,
consistent
with
an
AF
promoting
effect
of
Ca

(
2
+
)
channel
inhibition
.

METHODS
:
To
evaluate
the
potential
mechanisms
of
AF
promotion
by
Ca

(
2
+
)
channel
blockers
,
we
administered
verapamil
to
morphine
-
chloralose
anesthetized
dogs
.

Diltiazem
was
used
as
a
comparison
drug
and
autonomic
blockade
with
atropine
and
nadolol
was
applied
in
some
experiments
.

Epicardial
mapping
with
240
epicardial
electrodes
was
used
to
evaluate
activation
during
AF
.

RESULTS
:

Verapamil
caused
AF
promotion
in
six
dogs
,
increasing
mean
duration
of
AF
induced
by
burst
pacing
,
from
8+/-4
s
(
mean+/-S.E.
)
to
95+/-39
s

(
P<0.01
vs.
control
)
at
a
loading
dose
of
0.1
mg
/
kg
and
228+/-101

s
(
P<0.0005
vs.
control
)
at
a
dose
of
0.2
mg
/
kg
.

Underlying
electrophysiological
mechanisms
were
studied
in
detail
in
five
additional
dogs
under
control
conditions
and
in
the
presence
of
the
higher
dose
of
verapamil
.

In
these
experiments
,
verapamil
shortened
mean
effective
refractory
period
(
ERP
)
from
122+/-5
to
114+/-4
ms
(
P<0.02
)
at
a
cycle
length
of
300
ms
,
decreased
ERP
heterogeneity
(
from
15+/-1
to
10+/-1
%
,
P<0.05
)
,
heterogeneously
accelerated
atrial
conduction
and
decreased
the
cycle
length
of
AF

(
94+/-4
to
84+/-3
ms
,
P<0.005
)
.

Diltiazem
did
not
affect
ERP
,
AF
cycle
length
or
AF
duration
,
but
produced
conduction
acceleration
similar
to
that
caused
by
verapamil

(
n=5
)
.

In
the
presence
of
autonomic
blockade
,
verapamil
failed
to
promote
AF
and
increased
,
rather
than
decreasing
,
refractoriness
.

Neither
verapamil
nor
diltiazem
affected
atrial
conduction
in
the
presence
of
autonomic
blockade
.

Epicardial
mapping
suggested
that
verapamil
promoted
AF
by
increasing
the
number
of
simultaneous
wavefronts
reflected
by
separate
zones
of
reactivation
in
each
cycle
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Verapamil
promotes

AF
in
normal
dogs
by
promoting
multiple
circuit
reentry
,
an
effect
dependent
on
intact
autonomic
tone
and
not
shared
by
diltiazem
.

Hypotension
,
bradycardia
,
and
asystole
after
high
-
dose
intravenous
methylprednisolone
in
a
monitored
patient
.

We
report
a
case
of
hypotension
,
bradycardia
,
and
asystole
after
intravenous
administration
of
high
-
dose
methylprednisolone
in
a
73-year
-
old
patient
who
underwent
electrocardiographic
(
ECG
)
monitoring
throughout
the
episode
.

There
was
a
history
of
ischemic

cardiac
disease
9
years
earlier
.

The
patient
was
admitted
with
a
pulmonary
-
renal
syndrome
with
hemoptysis
,
rapidly
progressive
renal
failure
,
and
hypoxemia
that
required
mechanical
ventilation
in
the
intensive
care
unit
.

After
receiving
advanced
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
,
the
patient
recovered
cardiac
rhythm
.

The
ECG
showed
a
junctional
rhythm
without
ventricular
arrhythmia
.

This
study
reviews
the
current
proposed
mechanisms
of
sudden
death
after
a
high
dose
of
intravenous
methylprednisolone

(
IVMP
)
.

These
mechanisms
are
not
well
understood
because
,
in
most
cases
,
the
patients
were
not
monitored
at
the
moment
of
the
event
.

Rapid
infusion
and
underlying
cardiac
disease
were
important
risk
factors
in
the
case
reported
here
,
and
the
authors
discount
ventricular
arrhythmia
as
the
main
mechanism
.

Lifetime
treatment
of
mice
with
azidothymidine

(
AZT
)
produces
myelodysplasia
.

AZT
has
induced
a
macrocytic
anemia
in
AIDS
patients
on
long
term
AZT
therapy
.

It
is
generally
assumed
that
DNA
elongation
is
stopped
by
the
insertion
of
AZT
into
the
chain
in
place
of
thymidine
thus
preventing
the
phosphate
hydroxyl
linkages
and
therefore
suppresses
hemopoietic
progenitor
cell
proliferation
in
an
early
stage
of
differentiation
.

CBA
/
Ca
male
mice
started
on
AZT

0.75
mg
/
ml
H2O
at
84
days
of
age
and
kept
on
it
for
687
days
when
dosage
reduced
to
0.5
mg
/
ml
H2O
for
a
group
,
another
group
removed
from
AZT
to
see
recovery
,
and
third
group
remained
on
0.75
mg
.

At
687
days
mice
that
had
been
on
0.75
mg
had
average
platelet
counts
of
2.5
x
10(6
)
.

Histological
examination
on
9
of
10
mice
with
such
thrombocytopenia
showed
changes
compatible
with
myelodysplastic
syndrome

(
MDS
)
.

A
variety
of
histological
patterns
was
observed
.

There
were
two
cases
of
hypocellular
myelodysplasia
,
two
cases
of
hypersegmented
myelodysplastic
granulocytosis
,
two
cases
of
hypercellular
marrow
with
abnormal
megakaryocytes
with
bizarre
nuclei
,
one
case
of
megakaryocytic
myelosis
associated
with
a
hyperplastic
marrow
,
dysmyelopoiesis
and
a
hypocellular
marrow
and
two
cases
of
myelodysplasia
with
dyserythropoiesis
,
hemosiderosis
and
a
hypocellular
marrow
.

Above
mentioned
AZT

incorporation
may
have
induced
an
ineffective
hemopoiesis
in
the
primitive
hemopoietic
progenitor
cells
,
which
is
known
to
be
seen
commonly
in
the
myelodysplastic
syndrome
.

Influence
of
diet
free
of
NAD
-precursors
on
acetaminophen

hepatotoxicity
in
mice
.

Recently
,
we
demonstrated
the
hepatoprotective
effects
of
nicotinic
acid
amide
,
a
selective
inhibitor
of
poly(ADP
-
ribose
)
polymerase
(
PARP
;
EC
2.4.2.30
)
on
mice
suffering
from
acetaminophen

(
AAP
)
-
hepatitis
,
suggesting
that
the
AAP
-induced
liver
injury
involves
a
step
which
depends
on
adenoribosylation
.

The
present
study
investigates
the
effects
of
a
diet
free
of
precursors
of
NAD
,
the
substrate
on
which
PARP
acts
,
in
female
NMRI
mice
with
AAP
hepatitis
and
evaluates
the
influence
of
simultaneous
ethanol
consumption
in
these
animals
.

Liver
injuries
were
quantified
as
serum
activities
of

(

)
and
glutamate

)
.

While
AAP
caused
a
117-fold
elevation
of
serum
transaminase
activities
in
mice
kept
on
a
standard
laboratory
diet
,
which
was
significantly
exacerbated
by
ethanol
and
inhibited
by
nicotinic
acid
amide

(
NAA
)
,
adverse
effects
were
noted
in
animals
fed
a
diet
free
of
precursors
of
NAD
.

In
these
animals
,
only
minor
increases
of
serum
transaminase
activities
were
measured
in
the
presence
of
AAP
,
and
unlike
the
exacerbation
caused
by
ethanol
in
mice
on
a
standard
diet
,
the
liver
damage
was
inhibited
by
50
%
by
ethanol
.

A
further
64
%
reduction
of
hepatitis
was
observed
,
when
NAA
was
given
to
ethanol
/
AAP
-mice
.

Our
results
provide
evidence
that
the
AAP
-induced
hepatitis
and
its
exacerbation
by
ethanol
can
either
be
reduced
by
end
-
product
inhibition
of
PARP
by
NAA
or
by
dietary
depletion
of
the
enzyme
's
substrate
NAD
.

We
see
the
main
application
of
NAA
as
for
the
combinational
use
in
pharmaceutical
preparations
of
acetaminophen
in
order
to
avoid
hepatic
damage
in
patients
treated
with
this
widely
used
analgesic
.

Antiarrhythmic
plasma
concentrations
of
cibenzoline
on
canine
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

Using
two
-

coronary
ligation-
,
digitalis
-
,
and
adrenaline
-induced
canine
ventricular
arrhythmias
,
antiarrhythmic
effects
of
cibenzoline
were
examined
and
the
minimum
effective
plasma
concentration
for
each
arrhythmia
model
was
determined
.

Cibenzoline
suppressed
all
the
arrhythmias
,
and
the
minimum
effective
plasma
concentrations
for
arrhythmias
induced
by
24-h
coronary
ligation
,
48-h

)

micrograms

,
respectively
(

SDM
,
n

)
.

The
concentration
for
adrenaline
-induced

arrhythmia
was
significantly
higher
than
those
for
the
other
types
of
arrhythmias
.

This
pharmacological
profile
is
similar
to
those
of
mexiletine
and
tocainide
,
and
all
three
drugs
have
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
stimulant
action
.

Because
cibenzoline
had
only
weak
hypotensive
and
sinus
node

depressive
effects
and
was
found
to
be
orally
active
when
given
to
coronary
ligation
arrhythmia
dogs
,
its
clinical
usefulness
is
expected
.

Immunopathology
of
penicillamine

-induced

glomerular
disease
.

Four
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
developed
heavy
proteinuria
after
five
to
12
months
of
treatment
with
D
-
penicillamine
.

Light
microscopy
of
renal
biopsy
samples
showed
minimal
glomerular
capillary
wall
thickening
and
mesangial
matrix
increase
,
or
no
departure
from
normal
.

Electron
microscopy
,
however
,
revealed
subepithelial
electron
-
dense
deposits
,
fusion
of
epithelial
cell
foot
processes
,
and
evidence
of
mesangial
cell
hyperactivity
.

Immunofluorescence
microscopy
demonstrated
granular
capillary
wall
deposits
of
IgG
and
C3
.

The
findings
were
similar
to
those
in
early
membranous
glomerulonephritis
,
differences
being
observed
however
in
the
results
of
staining
for
the
early
-
acting
complement
components
C1q
and
C4
.

It
is
tentatively
concluded
that
complement
was
activated
by
the
classical
pathway
.

Ventricular

diatrizoate
with

without
chelating
agents
.

The
toxicity
of
Renografin

was
compared
with
that
of
Hypaque
76
%
by
selective
injection
of
each
into
the
right
coronary
artery
of
dogs
.

Renografin
contains
the
chelating
agents
sodium
citrate
and
disodium
edetate
,
while
Hypaque
contains
calcium
disodium
edetate
and
no
sodium
citrate
.

Ventricular
fibrillation
occurred
significantly
more
often
with
Renografin
,
suggesting
that
chelating
agents
contribute
to
toxicity
in
coronary

.

Rapid
reversal
of
anticoagulation
reduces
hemorrhage
volume
in
a
mouse
model
of
warfarin

-associated

intracerebral
hemorrhage
.

Warfarin

-associated

intracerebral
hemorrhage

(
W-
ICH
)
is
a
severe
type
of
stroke
.

There
is
no
consensus
on
the
optimal
treatment
for
W-
ICH
.

Using
a
mouse
model
,
we
tested
whether
the
rapid
reversal
of
anticoagulation
using
human
prothrombin
complex
concentrate

(
PCC
)
can
reduce
hemorrhagic
blood
volume
.

Male
CD-1
mice
were
treated
with
warfarin

(
2
mg
/
kg
over
24
h
)
,
resulting
in
a
mean
(
+
/-s.d
.
)

International
Normalized
Ratio
of
3.5+/-0.9
.

First
,
we
showed
that
an
intravenous
administration
of
human
PCC
rapidly
reversed
anticoagulation
in
mice
.

Second
,
a
stereotactic
injection
of
collagenase
was
administered
to
induce
hemorrhage
in
the
right
striatum
.

Forty
-
five
minutes
later
,
the
animals
were
randomly
treated
with
PCC

(
100
U
/
kg
)
or
saline
i.v
.

(
n=12
per
group
)
.

Twenty
-
four
hours
after
hemorrhage
induction
,
hemorrhagic
blood
volume
was
quantified
using
a
photometric
hemoglobin
assay
.

The
mean
hemorrhagic
blood
volume
was
reduced
in
PCC

-treated
animals
(
6.5+/-3.1
microL
)
compared
with
saline
controls
(
15.3+/-11.2
microL
,
P=0.015
)
.

In
the
saline
group
,
45
%
of
the
mice
developed
large
hematomas

(
i.e.
,
>
15
microL
)
.

In
contrast
,
such
extensive
lesions
were
never
found
in
the
PCC
group
.

We
provide
experimental
data
suggesting
PCC
to
be
an
effective
acute
treatment
for
W-
ICH
in
terms
of
reducing
hemorrhagic
blood
volume
.

Future
studies
are
needed
to
assess
the
therapeutic
potential
emerging
from
our
finding
for
human
W-
ICH
.

Impact
of
alcohol
exposure
after
pregnancy
recognition
on
ultrasonographic
fetal
growth
measures
.

BACKGROUND
:

More
than
3
decades
after
Jones
and
Smith
(
1973
)
reported
on
the
devastation
caused
by
alcohol
exposure
on
fetal
development
,
the
rates
of
heavy
drinking
during
pregnancy
remain
relatively
unchanged
.

Early
identification
of
fetal
alcohol
exposure
and
maternal
abstinence
led
to
better
infant
outcomes
.

This
study
examined
the
utility
of
biometry
for
detecting
alcohol
-related
fetal
growth
impairment
.

METHODS
:

We
obtained
fetal
ultrasound
measures
from
routine
ultrasound
examinations
for
167
pregnant
hazardous
drinkers
who
were
enrolled
in
a
brief
alcohol
intervention
study
.

The
fetal
measures
for
women
who
quit
after
learning
of
their
pregnancies
were
compared
with
measures
for
women
who
continued
some
drinking
throughout
the
course
of
their
pregnancies
.

Because
intensity
of
alcohol
consumption
is
associated
with
poorer
fetal
outcomes
,
separate
analyses
were
conducted
for
the
heavy
(
average
of
>
or=5
drinks
per
drinking
day
)

alcohol
consumers
.

Fetal
measures
from
the
heavy
-
exposed
fetuses
were
also
compared
with
measures
from
a
nondrinking
group
that
was
representative
of
normal
,
uncomplicated
pregnancies
from
our
clinics
.

Analyses
of
covariance
were
used
to
determine
whether
there
were
differences
between
groups
after
controlling
for
influences
of
gestational
age
and
drug
abuse
.

RESULTS
:

Nearly
half
of
the
pregnant
drinkers
abstained
after
learning
of
their
pregnancies
.

When
women
reportedly
quit
drinking
early
in
their
pregnancies
,
fetal
growth
measures
were
not
significantly
different
from
a
non-
alcohol
-exposed
group
,
regardless
of
prior
drinking
patterns
.

Any
alcohol
consumption
postpregnancy
recognition
among
the
heavy
drinkers
resulted
in
reduced
cerebellar
growth
as
well
as
decreased
cranial
to
body
growth
in
comparison
with
women
who
either
quit
drinking
or
who
were
nondrinkers
.

Amphetamine
abuse
was
predictive
of
larger
cranial
to
body
growth
ratios
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Alterations
in
fetal
biometric
measurements
were
observed
among
the
heavy
drinkers
only
when
they
continued
drinking
after
becoming
aware
of
their
pregnancies
.

Although
the
reliance
on
self
-
reported
drinking
is
a
limitation
in
this
study
,
these
findings
support
the
benefits
of
early
abstinence
and
the
potential
for
ultrasound
examinations
in
the
detection
of
fetal
alcohol
effects
.

Urinary
symptoms
and
quality
of

in
Thai
women
with
overactive
bladder
after
tolterodine
treatment
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
study
the
urinary
symptoms
and
quality
of
life
changes
in
Thai
women
with
overactive
bladder

(
OAB
)
after
tolterodine
treatment
.

MATERIAL
AND
METHOD
:
Thirty
women
(
aged
30
-
77
years
)
diagnosed
as
having
OAB
at
the
Gynecology
Clinic
,
King
Chulalongkorn
Memorial
Hospital
from
January
to
April
2004
were
included
in
the
present
study
.

Tolterodine
2
mg
,
twice
daily
was
given
.

After
8
weeks
treatment
,
changes
in
micturition
diary
variables
and
tolerability
were
determined
.

Short
form
36
(
SF36
)
questionaires
(
Thai
version
)
were
given
before
and
after
8
weeks
of
treatment
.

RESULTS
:

At
8
weeks
,
all
micturition
per
day
decreased
from
16
.

7
+
/-

.

The
number
of
nocturia
episodes
decreased
from
5.4
+
/-

4.2
to
1.1
+
/-

1.0
times
per
night
.

The
most
common
side
effect
was
dry
month
in
5
cases
(
16.7
%
)
with
2
cases
reporting
a
moderate
degree
and
1
case
with
severe
degree
.

Only
one
case
(
3.3
%
)
withdrew
from
the
present
study
due
to
a
severe
dry
mouth
.

The
SF-36
scores
changed
significantly
in
the
domains
of
physical
functioning
,
role
function
emotional
,
social
function
and
mental
heath
.

CONCLUSION
:

Tolterodine
was
well
tolerated
and
its
effects
improved
the
quality
of
life
in
Thai
women
with
OAB
.

Absence
of
acute
cerebral
vasoconstriction
after
cocaine
-associated
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Cocaine
use
has
been
associated
with
neurovascular
complications
,
including
arterial
vasoconstriction
and
vasculitis
.

However
,
there
are
few
studies
of
angiographic
effects
of
cocaine
on
human
cerebral
arteries
.

Information
on
these
effects
could
be
obtained
from
angiograms
of
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

subarachnoid
hemorrhage

(
SAH
)
who
underwent
angiography
shortly
after
cocaine
use
.

METHODS
:

We
screened
patients
with
SAH
retrospectively
and
identified
those
with
positive
urine
toxicology
for
cocaine
or
its
metabolites
.

Quantitative
arterial
diameter
measurements
from
angiograms
of
these
patients
were
compared
to
measurements
from
control
patients
with
SAH
who
were
matched
for
factors
known
to
influence
arterial
diameter
.

Qualitative
comparisons
of
small
artery
changes
also
were
made
.

RESULTS
:

Thirteen
patients
with
positive
cocaine
toxicology
were
compared
to
26
controls
.

There
were
no
significant
differences
between
groups
in
the
mean
diameters
of
the
intradural
internal
carotid
,
sphenoidal
segment
of
the
middle
cerebral
,
precommunicating
segment
of
the
anterior
cerebral
,
or
basilar
arteries
(
p
greater
than
0.05
for
all
comparisons
,
unpaired
t
-
tests
)
.

There
also
were
no
significant
differences
between
groups
when
expressing
diameters
as
the
sum
of
the
precommunicating
segment
of
the
anterior
cerebral
+
sphenoidal
segment
of
the
middle
cerebral
+
supraclinoid
internal
carotid
artery
+
basilar
artery
divided
by
the
diameter
of
the
petrous
internal
carotid
artery
(
p
greater
than
0.05
,
unpaired
t
-
tests
)
.

Qualitative
assessments
showed
two
arterial
irregularities
in
the
distal
vasculature
in
each
group
.

CONCLUSION
:

No
quantitative
evidence
for
narrowing
of
large
cerebral
arteries
or
qualitative
angiographic
evidence
for
distal
narrowing
or
vasculitis
could
be
found
in
patients
who
underwent
angiography
after
aneurysmal
SAH
associated
with
cocaine
use
.

Atrial

IIIE
diffuse
large
B
-

lymphoma
in
a
patient
with

)
.

The
authors
describe
the
unusual
association
between
diffuse
B
-
cell
gastric
lymphoma
and
myotonic
dystrophy
,
the
most
common
form
of
adult
muscular

,
and
sudden
atrial

following
one
cycle
of
doxorubicin
-based
chemotherapy
in
the
same
patient
.

Atrial
fibrillation
or
other
cardiac
arrhythmias
are
unusual
complications
in
patients
treated
with
chemotherapy
.

The
cardiac
toxicity
intrinsically
associated
with
the
aggressive
chemotherapy
employed
could
function
as
a
triggering
factor
for
the
arrhythmia
in
the
predisposed
myocardium
of
this
patient
.

A
phase
II
study
of
thalidomide
in
advanced
metastatic
renal
cell
carcinoma
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
evaluate
the
toxicity
and
activity
of
thalidomide
in
patients
with
advanced
metastatic
renal
cell
cancer
and
to
measure
changes
of
one
angiogenic
factor
,
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF)165
,
with
therapy
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
29
patients
were
enrolled
on
a
study
of
thalidomide
using
an
intra
-
patient
dose
escalation
schedule
.

Patients
began

thalidomide
at
400
mg
/
d
and
escalated
as
tolerated
to
1200
mg
/
d
by
day
54
.

Fifty
-
nine
per
cent
of
patients
had
had
previous
therapy
with
IL-2
and
52
%
were
performance
status
2
or
3
.

Systemic
plasma
VEGF165
levels
were
measured
by
dual
monoclonal
ELISA
in
8
patients
.

RESULTS
:
24
patients
were
evaluable
for
response
with
one
partial
response
of
11
months
duration
of
a
patient
with
hepatic
and
pulmonary
metastases
(
4
%
)
,
one
minor
response
,
and
2
patients
stable
for
over
6
months
.

Somnolence
and
constipation
were
prominent

toxicities
and
most
patients
could
not
tolerate
the
1200
mg
/
day
dose
level
.

Systemic
plasma
VEGF165
levels
did
not
change
with
therapy
.

CONCLUSION
:

These
results
are
consistent
with
a
low
level
of
activity
of
thalidomide
in
renal
cell
carcinoma
.

Administration
of
doses
over
800
mg
/
day
was
difficult
to
achieve
in
this
patient
population
,
however
lower
doses
were
practical
.

The
dose
-
response
relationship
,
if
any
,
of
thalidomide
for
renal
cell
carcinoma
is
unclear
.

AIDA
in
doses
of

.

In

may
suggest
that
the

not
the

may
ameliorate

.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
acute
cholestatic
hepatitis
following
exposure
to
the
inhalational
anesthetic
isoflurane
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
70-year
-
old
healthy
woman
from
Iraq
developed
acute
cholestatic
hepatitis
3
weeks
following
repair
of
the
right
rotator
cuff
under
general
anesthesia
.

There
was
no
evidence
for
viral
,
autoimmune
,
or
metabolic
causes
of
hepatitis
.

No
other
medications
were
involved
except
for
dipyrone
for

The
alanine
aminotransferase
was
elevated
to
a
peak
concentration
of
1533
U

and
the
serum
bilirubin
reached
a
peak
of
17.0
mg

There
was
slow
improvement
over
4
months
.

Accidental
reexposure
by
the

DISCUSSION
:

The
clinical
and
histologic
picture
of
this
case
resembles
halothane
hepatitis
,
which
has
a
significant
mortality
rate
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Isoflurane
,
a
common
anesthetic
agent
,
can
cause
severe
cholestatic
hepatitis

Calcitonin
gene
-
related
peptide
levels
during

nitric
oxide
-induced

headache
in
patients
with
chronic
tension
-
type
headache
.

It
has
been
proposed
that
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
induced

headache
in
primary
headaches
may
be
associated
with
release
of
calcitonin
gene
-
related
peptide
(
CGRP
)
.

In
the
present
study
we
aimed
to
investigate
plasma
levels
of
CGRP
during
headache
induced
by
the
NO
donor
glyceryl
trinitrate

(
GTN
)
in
16
patients
with
chronic
tension
-
type
headache
and
16
healthy
controls
.

The
subjects
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
0.5
microg
/
kg
/
min

GTN
or
placebo
over
20
min
on
two
headache
-free
days
.

Blood
samples
were
collected
at
baseline
,
10
,
20
and
60
min
after
start
of
infusion
.

Both
patients
and
controls
developed
significantly
stronger
immediate
headache
on
the
GTN
day
than
on
the
placebo
day
and
the
headache
was
significantly
more
pronounced
in
patients
than
in
controls
.

There
was
no
difference
between
the
area
under
the
CGRP
curve
(
AUCCGRP
)
on

GTN
vs.

placebo
day
in
either
patients
(
P=0.65
)
or
controls
(
P=0.48
)
.

The
AUCCGRP
recorded
on
the
GTN
day
did
not
differ
between
patients
and
controls
(
P=0.36
)
.

Both
in
patients
and
controls
,
CGRP
levels
changed
significantly
over
time
,
on
both
the
GTN
and
placebo
days
(
P
0.05
)
.

The
present
study
indicates
that
NO
-induced
immediate
headache
is
not
associated
with
release
of
CGRP
.

Myocardial
ischemia
due
to
coronary
artery
spasm
during
dobutamine
stress
echocardiography
.

Dobutamine
stress
echocardiography
(
DSE
)
is
a
useful
and
safe
provocation
test
for
myocardial
ischemia
.

Until
now
,
the
test
has
been
focused
only
on
the
organic
lesion
in
the
coronary
artery
,
and
positive
DSE
has
indicated
the
presence
of
significant
fixed
coronary
artery
stenosis
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
is
to
examine
whether
myocardial
ischemia
due
to
coronary
spasm
is
induced
by
dobutamine
.

We
performed
DSE
on
51
patients
with
coronary
spastic
angina
but
without
significant
fixed
coronary
artery
stenosis
.

All
patients
had
anginal
attacks
at
rest
with
ST
elevation
on
the
electrocardiogram
(
variant
angina
)
.

Coronary
spasm
was
induced
by
intracoronary
injection
of
acetylcholine
,
and
no
fixed
coronary
artery
stenosis
was
documented
on
angiograms
in
all
patients
.

DSE
was
performed
with
intravenous
dobutamine
infusion
with
an
incremental
doses
of
5
,
10
,
20
,
30
,
and
40
microg
/
kg
/

min
every
5
minutes
.

Of
the
51
patients
,
7
patients
showed
asynergy
with
ST
elevation
.

All
7
patients
(
13.7
%
)
had
chest
pain
during
asynergy
,
and
both
chest
pain
and
electrocardiographic
changes
were
preceded
by
asynergy
.

These
findings
indicate
that
dobutamine
can
provoke
coronary
spasm
in
some
patients
with
coronary
spastic
angina
.

When
DSE
is
performed
to
evaluate
coronary
artery
disease
,
not
only
fixed
coronary
stenosis
,
but
also
coronary
spasm
should
be
considered
as
a
genesis
of
asynergy
.

Nitric
oxide
synthase
expression
in
the
course
of
lead
-induced
hypertension
.

We
recently
showed
elevated
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
reduced
urinary
excretion
of
NO
metabolites
(
NOx
)
,
and
increased
NO
sequestration
as
nitrotyrosine
in
various
tissues
in
rats
with
lead
-induced
hypertension
.

This
study
was
designed
to
discern
whether
the
reduction
in
urinary
NOx
in
lead
-induced
hypertension
is
,
in
part
,
due
to
depressed
NO
synthase
(
NOS
)
expression
.

Male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
randomly
assigned
to
a
lead
-treated
group
(
given
lead
acetate
,
100
ppm
,
in
drinking
water
and
regular
rat
chow
)
,
a
group
given
lead
and
vitamin
E

-fortified
chow
,
or
a
normal
control
group
given
either
regular
food
and
water
or
vitamin
E

-fortified
food
for
12
weeks
.

Tail
blood
pressure
,
urinary
NOx
excretion
,
plasma
malondialdehyde

(
MDA
)
,
and
endothelial
and
inducible
NOS
(
eNOS
and
iNOS
)
isotypes
in
the
aorta
and
kidney
were
measured
.

The
lead
-treated
group
exhibited
a
rise
in
blood
pressure
and
plasma

MDA
concentration
,
a
fall
in
urinary
NOx
excretion
,
and
a
paradoxical
rise
in
vascular
and
renal
tissue
eNOS
and
iNOS
expression
.

Vitamin
E
supplementation
ameliorated

hypertension
,
lowered
plasma

MDA
concentration
,
and
raised
urinary
NOx
excretion
while
significantly
lowering
vascular
,
but
not
renal
,
tissue
eNOS
and
iNOS
expression
.

Vitamin
E
supplementation
had
no
effect
on
either
blood
pressure
,
plasma
MDA
,
or
NOS
expression
in
the
control
group
.

The
study
also
revealed
significant
inhibition
of
NOS
enzymatic
activity
by
lead
in
cell
-
free
preparations
.

In
conclusion
,
lead
-induced
hypertension
in
this
model
was
associated
with
a
compensatory
upregulation
of
renal
and
vascular
eNOS
and
iNOS
expression
.

This
is
,
in
part
,
due
to
ROS
-
mediated
NO
inactivation
,

lead
-associated
inhibition
of
NOS
activity
,
and
perhaps
stimulatory
actions
of
increased
shear
stress
associated
with
hypertension
.

Risk
for
valvular
heart
disease
among
users
of
fenfluramine
and
dexfenfluramine
who
underwent
echocardiography
before
use
of
medication
.

BACKGROUND
:

Because
uncontrolled
echocardiographic
surveys
suggested
that
up
to
30
%
to
38
%
of
users
of
fenfluramine
and
dexfenfluramine
had
valvular
disease
,
these
drugs
were
withdrawn
from
the
market
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
determine
the
risk
for
new
or
worsening
valvular
abnormalities
among
users
of
fenfluramine
or
dexfenfluramine
who
underwent
echocardiography
before
they
began
to
take
these
medications
.

DESIGN
:

Cohort
study
.

SETTING
:

Academic
primary
care
practices
.

PATIENTS
:
46
patients
who
used
fenfluramine
or
dexfenfluramine
for
14
days
or
more
and
had
echocardiograms
obtained
before
therapy
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
Follow
-
up
echocardiography
.

The
primary
outcome
was
new
or
worsening
valvulopathy
,
defined
as
progression
of
either
aortic
or
mitral
regurgitation
by
at
least
one
degree
of
severity
and
disease
that
met
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
criteria
(
at
least
mild
aortic
regurgitation
or
moderate
mitral
regurgitation
)
.

RESULTS
:

Two
patients
(
4.3
%
[
95
%
CI
,
0.6
%
to
14.8
%
]
)
receiving
fenfluramine
-
phentermine
developed
valvular
heart
disease
.

One
had
baseline
bicuspid
aortic
valve
and
mild
aortic
regurgitation
that
progressed
to
moderate
regurgitation
.

The
second
patient
developed
new
moderate
aortic
insufficiency
.

CONCLUSION
:

Users
of
diet
medications
are
at
risk
for
valvular
heart
disease
.

However
,
the
incidence
may
be
lower
than
that
reported
previously
.

Carboplatin
toxic
effects
on
the
peripheral
nervous
system
of
the
rat
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
most
striking
of
carboplatin
's
advantages
(
CBDCA
)
over
cisplatin

(
CDDP
)
is
its
markedly
reduced
rate
of
neurotoxic
effects
.

However
,
the
use
of
CBDCA
higher
-
intensity
schedules
and
the
association
with
other
neurotoxic
drugs
in
polychemotherapy
may
cause
some
concern
about
its
safety
with
respect
to
peripheral
nervous
system
damage
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

Two
different
schedules
of
CBDCA
administration
(
10
mg
/
kg
and
15
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
twice
a
week
for
nine
times
)
were
evaluated
in
Wistar
rats
.

Neurotoxicity
was
assessed
for
behavioral
(
tail
-
flick
test
)
,
neurophysiological
(
nerve
conduction
velocity
in
the
tail
nerve
)
,
morphological
,
morphometrical
and
analytical
effects
.

RESULTS
:

CBDCA
administration
induced
dose
-
dependent
peripheral
neurotoxicity
.

Pain
perception
and
nerve
conduction
velocity
in
the
tail
were
significantly
impaired
,
particularly
after
the
high
-
dose
treatment
.

The
dorsal
root
ganglia
sensory
neurons
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
satellite
cells
showed
the
same
changes
as
those
induced
by
CDDP
,
mainly
affecting
the
nucleus
and
nucleolus
of
ganglionic
sensory
neurons
.

Moreover
,
significant
amounts
of
platinum
were
detected
in
the
dorsal
root
ganglia
and
kidney
after
CBDCA
treatment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

CBDCA
is

neurotoxic
in
our
model
,
and
the
type
of
pathological
changes
it
induces
are
so
closely
similar
to
those
caused
by
CDDP
that
it
is
probable
that
neurotoxicity
is
induced
in
the
two
drugs
by
the
same
mechanism
.

This
model
can
be
used
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
drugs
to
explore
the
effect
of
CBDCA
on
the
peripheral
nervous
system
.

Iatrogenic
risks
of
endometrial
carcinoma
after
treatment
for
breast
cancer
in
a
large
French
case
-
control
study
.

F

.

Since

tamoxifen
is
widely
used
in
breast
cancer
treatment
and
has
been
proposed
for
the
prevention
of
breast
cancer
,
its
endometrial
iatrogenic
effects
must
be
carefully
examined
.

We
have
investigated
the
association
between
endometrial
cancer
and
tamoxifen
use
or
other
treatments
in
women
treated
for
breast
cancer
in
a
case
-
control
study
.

Cases
of
endometrial
cancer
diagnosed
after
breast
cancer

(
n
=
135
)
and
467
controls
matched
for
age
,
year
of
diagnosis
of
breast
cancer
and
hospital
and
survival
time
with
an
intact
uterus
were
included
.

Women
who
had
received
tamoxifen
were
significantly
more
likely
to
have
endometrial
cancer
diagnosed
than
those
who
had
not
(
crude
relative
risk
=
4.9
,
p
=
0.0001
)
.

Univariate
and
adjusted
analyses
showed
that
the
risk
increased
with
the
length
of
treatment
(
p
=
0.0001
)
or
the
cumulative
dose
of
tamoxifen
received
(
p
=
0.0001
)
,
irrespective
of
the
daily
dose
.

Women
who
had
undergone
pelvic
radiotherapy
also
had
a
higher
risk
(
crude
relative
risk
=
7.8
,
p
=
0.0001
)
.

After
adjusting
for
confounding
factors
,
the
risk
was
higher
for
tamoxifen
users
(
p
=
0.0012
)
,
treatment
for
more
than
3
years
(
all
p
0.03
)
and
pelvic
radiotherapy
(
p
=
0.012
)
.

Women
who
had
endometrial
cancer
and
had
received
tamoxifen
had
more
advanced
disease
and
poorer
prognosis
than
those
with
endometrial
cancer
who
had
not
received
this
treatment
.

Our
results
suggest
a
causal
role
of
tamoxifen
in
endometrial
cancer
,
particularly
when
used
as
currently
proposed
for
breast
cancer
prevention
.

Pelvic
radiotherapy
may
be
an
additional
iatrogenic
factor
for
women
with
breast
cancer
.

Endometrial
cancers
diagnosed
in
women
treated
with
tamoxifen
have
poorer
prognosis
.

Women
who
receive
tamoxifen
for
breast
cancer
should
be
offered
gynaecological
surveillance
during
and
after
treatment
.

A
long
-
term
evaluation
of
the
risk
-
benefit
ratio
of
tamoxifen
as
a
preventive
treatment
for
breast
cancer
is
clearly
warranted
.

Granulosa
cell
tumor
of
the
ovary
associated
with
antecedent
tamoxifen
use
.

BACKGROUND
:

Increased
attention
has
been
focused
recently
on
the
estrogenic
effects
of
tamoxifen
.

Review
of
the
literature
reveals
an
association
between
tamoxifen
use
and
gynecologic
tumors
.

CASE
:

A
52-year
-
old
postmenopausal
woman
was
treated
with
tamoxifen
for
stage
II

estrogen
receptor
-
positive
breast
carcinoma
.

Her
aspartate
transaminase
and
alanine
transaminase
levels
increase
markedly
after
6
months
of
tamoxifen
use
.

After
an
additional
17
months
of
elevated
serum
transaminases
,
the
patient
was
found
to
have
a
stage
Ic
granulosa
cell
tumor
of
the
ovary
.

CONCLUSION
:

Patients
with
tamoxifen

-induced

liver
dysfunction
may
be
at
increased
risk
for
granulosa
cell
tumors
because
of
alterations
in
tamoxifen
metabolism
.

A
murine
model
of
adenomyosis
:
the
effects
of
hyperprolactinemia
induced
by
fluoxetine
hydrochloride
,
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
,
on
adenomyosis
induction
in
Wistar
albino
rats
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
whether
fluoxetine
given
to
castrated
and
noncastrated
rats
caused
hyperprolactinemia
and
its
effects
with
respect
to
adenomyosis
.

DESIGN
:

Fluoxetine
,
a
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
,
was
given
to
Wistar
Albino
rats
for
98
days
to
produce
hyperprolactinemia
.

The
drug
was
given
to
two
groups
consisting
of
castrated
and
noncastrated
rats
and
compared
to
two
groups
of
castrated
and
noncastrated
controls
.

Prolactin
levels
were
measured
and
the
uteri
of
the
rats
were
removed
for
histopathological
analysis
at
the
end
of
98
days
.

SETTING
:

Marmara
University
School
of
Medicine
,
Department
of
Histology
and
Embryology
,
Zeynep
Kamil
Women
and
Children
's
Hospital
.

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:

Serum
prolactin
levels
,
uterine
histopathology
.

RESULTS
:

The
prolactin
levels
of
castrated
and
noncastrated
groups
treated
with
fluoxetine
were
statistically
significantly
higher
when
compared
to
their
respective
control
groups
.

Histological
studies
revealed
11
cases
of
adenomyosis
,
all
within
the
noncastrated
group
receiving
fluoxetine
.

CONCLUSION
:

It
was
suggested
that
high
serum
prolactin
levels
cause
degeneration
of
myometrial
cells
in
the
presence
of
ovarian
steroids

that
results
in
a
myometrial
invasion
by
endometrial
stroma
.

This
invasion
eventually
progresses
to
adenomyosis
.

Effects
of
deliberate
hypotension
induced
by
labetalol
with
isoflurane
on
neuropsychological
function
.

The
effect
of
deliberate
hypotension
on
brain
function
measured
by
neuropsychological
tests
was
studied
in
41
adult
patients
.

Twenty
-
four
patients
were
anaesthetized
for
middle
-
ear
surgery
with
deliberate
hypotension
induced
by
labetalol
with
isoflurane

(
hypotensive
group
)
.

Seventeen
patients
without
hypotension
served
as
a
control
group
.

The
mean
arterial
pressure
was
77
+
/-

2
mmHg
(
10.3
+
/-
0.3
kPa
)
before

hypotension
and
50
+
/-
0

mmHg
(
6.7
+
/-

0.0
kPa
)
during

hypotension
in
the
hypotensive
group
,
and
86
+
/-

2
mmHg
(
11.5
+
/-
0.3
kPa
)
during
anaesthesia
in
the
control
group
.

The
following
psychological
tests
were
performed
:
four
subtests
of
the
Wechsler
Adult
Intelligence
Scale
(
similarities
,
digit
span
,
vocabulary
and

)
,

Making
tests
A
and
B
,
Zung
tests
(
self

anxiety
scale
and
self
-
rating
depression
scale
)
and
two
-
part
memory
test
battery
with
immediate
and
delayed
recall
.

The
tests
were
performed
preoperatively
and
2
days
postoperatively
.

There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
between
the
groups
in
any
of
the
tests
in
the
changes
from
preoperative
value
to
postoperative
value
.

The
results
indicate
that
hypotension
induced
by
labetalol
with
isoflurane
has
no
significant
harmful
effects
on
mental
functions
compared
to
normotensive
anaesthesia
.

Auditory
disturbance
associated
with
interscalene
brachial
plexus
block
.

We
performed
an
audiometric
study
in
20
patients
who
underwent
surgery
of
the
shoulder
region
under
an
interscalene
brachial
plexus
block
(
IBPB
)
.

Bupivacaine
0.75
%
with

adrenaline
was
given
followed
by
a
24-hr
continuous
infusion
of
0.25
%
bupivacaine
.

Three
audiometric
threshold
measurements
(
0.25
-
18
kHz
)
were
made
:
the
first
before
IBPB
,
the
second
2
-
6
h
after
surgery
and
the
third
on
the
first
day
after
operation
.

In
four
patients
hearing
impairment
on
the
side
of
the
block
was
demonstrated
after
operation
,
in
three
measurements
on
the
day
of
surgery
and
in
one
on
the
following
day
.

The
frequencies
at
which
the
impairment
occurred
varied
between
patients
;
in
one
only
low
frequencies
(
0.25
-
0.5
kHz
)
were
involved
.

The
maximum
change
in
threshold
was
35
dB
at
6
kHz
measured
at
the
end
of
the
continuous
infusion
of
bupivacaine
.

This
patient
had
hearing
threshold
changes
(
15
-
20
dB
)
at
6
-
10
kHz
on
the
opposite
side
also
.

IBPB
may
cause
transient
auditory
dysfunction
in
the
ipsilateral
ear
,
possibly
via
an
effect
on
sympathetic
innervation
.

Midazolam
compared
with
thiopentone
as
an
induction
agent
.

In
patients
premedicated
with
scopolamine
+
morphine

(

+
5
mg

nitrazepam
the
evening
before
surgery
)
,
the
sleep
-
inducing
effect
of
midazolam
0.15
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
was
clearly
slower
in
onset
than
that
of
thiopentone
4.67
mg
/
kg
i.v
.

Somewhat
fewer
cardiovascular
and
local
sequelae
were
found
in
the
midazolam
group
,
but
,
although
apnoea
occurred
less
often
in
the
midazolam
group
it
lasted
longer
.

On
the
whole
,
the
differences
between
midazolam
and
thiopentone
had
no
apparent
clinical
consequences
.

Midazolam
is
a
new
alternative
agent
for
induction
in
combination
anaesthesia
.

Cardiotoxic
and
possible
leukemogenic
effects
of
adriamycin
in
nonhuman
primates
.

10
monkeys
(
macaques
)
received
adriamycin
by
monthly
intravenous
injections
at
12
mg
/
m2
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
.

8
of
the
10
monkeys
developed

congestive
heart
failure
at
an
average
cumulative
adriamycin
dose
(
310
mg
/
m2
)
well
below
that
considered
the
safe
upper
limit
(
550
mg
/
m2
)
in
man
.

Histologically
,
the
myocardial
lesions
resembled
those
found
in
human
anthracycline
-induced
cardiomyopathy
.

1
of
the
10
monkeys
developed
acute
myeloblastic
leukemia
after
receiving
324
mg
/
m2
of
adriamycin
;
the
10th
monkey
is
alive
and
well
26
months
after
the
last
dose
of
drug
.

Our
results
suggest
that
adriamycin
is
a
more
potent
cardiotoxin
in
monkeys
than
in
man
,
and
that
leukemia
may
be
a
consequence
of
prolonged
treatment
with
this
drug
.

Doxorubicin

cardiomyopathy
in
children
with
left
-
sided
Wilms
tumor
.

Two
children
with
Wilms
tumor
of
the
left
kidney
experienced
severe
anthracycline
cardiomyopathy
after
irradiation
to
the
tumor
bed
and
conventional
dosage
of
doxorubicin
.

The
cardiomyopathy
is
attributed
1
)
to
the
fact
that
radiation
fields
for
left

Wilms
tumor
include
the
lower
portion
of
the
heart
and
2
)
to
the
interaction
of
doxorubicin
and
irradiation
on
cardiac
muscle
.

It
is
recommended
that
doxorubicin
dosage
be
sharply
restricted
in
children
with
Wilms
tumor
of
the
left
kidney
who
receive
postoperative
irradiation
.

Promotional
effects
of
testosterone
and
dietary
fat
on
prostate
carcinogenesis
in
genetically
susceptible
rats
.

Germfree
(
GF
)

Lobund
strain
Wistar
(
LW
)
rats
,
fed
vegetable
diet
L-485
,
have
developed

prostate
adenocarcinomas
spontaneously
(
10
%
incidence
)
at
average
age
34
months
.

Conventional
LW
rats
,
implanted
with
testosterone
at
age
4
months
,
developed
a
higher
incidence
of
prostate
cancer
after
an
average
interval
of
14
months
:
24
%
had
developed
gross
tumors
,
and
40
%
when
it
included
microscopic
tumors
.

Preliminary
results
indicate
that
testosterone
-treated
LW
rats
that
were
fed
the
same
diet
,
which
was
supplemented
with
corn
oil
up
to
20
%

,
developed
prostate
cancer
after
intervals
of
6
-
12
months
.

Aged
GF
Sprague

)
rats
have
not
developed
prostate
cancer
spontaneously
.

Conventional
SD
rats
fed
diet
L-485
and
treated
with
testosterone
developed
only
prostatitis
.

Experimental
designs
should
consider
genetic
susceptibility
as
a
basic
prerequisite
for
studies
on
experimental
prostate
cancer
.

Mitomycin
C
associated
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
.

Mitomycin
C
associated
Hemolytic
Uremic
Syndrome

(
HUS
)
is
a
potentially
fatal
but
uncommon
condition
that
is
not
yet
widely
recognised
.

It
consists
of
microangiopathic
hemolytic
anemia
,
thrombocytopenia
and
progressive
renal
failure
associated
with
mitomycin
C
treatment
and
affects
about
10
%
of
patients
treated
with
this
agent
.

The
renal
failure
usually
develops
about
8
-
10
mth
after
start
of
mitomycin
C
treatment
and
the
mortality
is
approximately
60
%
from
renal
failure
or
pulmonary
edema
.

Renal
lesions
are
similar
to
those
seen
in
idiopathic
HUS
and
include
arteriolar
fibrin
thrombi
,
expanded
subendothelial
zones
in
glomerular
capillary
walls
,
ischemic
wrinkling
of
glomerular
basement
membranes
and
mesangiolysis
.

The
mechanism
of
action
is
postulated
as
mitomycin
C

-induced
endothelial
cell
damage
.

We
describe
the
clinical
course
and
pathological
findings
in
a
65
yr
-
old
man
with
gastric
adenocarcinoma
who
developed
renal
failure
and
thrombocytopenia
while
on
treatment
with
mitomycin
C
and
died
in
pulmonary
edema
.

Continuous
ambulatory
ECG
monitoring
during
fluorouracil
therapy
:
a
prospective
study
.

Although
there
have
been
anecdotal
reports
of
cardiac
toxicity
associated
with
fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
therapy
,
this
phenomenon
has
not
been
studied
in
a
systematic
fashion
.

We
prospectively
performed
continuous
ambulatory
ECG
monitoring
on
25
patients
undergoing
5-FU
infusion
for
treatment
of
solid
tumors
in
order
to
assess
the
incidence
of
ischemic
ST
changes
.

Patients
were
monitored
for
23
+
/-

4
hours
before
5-FU
infusion
,
and
98
+
/-

9
hours
during
5-FU
infusion
.

Anginal
episodes
were
rare
:
only
one
patient
had
angina
(
during
5-FU
infusion
)
.

However
,
asymptomatic
ST
changes
(
greater
than
or
equal
to
1
mm
ST
deviation
)
were
common
:
six
of
25
patients
(
24
%
)
had
ST
changes
before
5-FU
infusion

v
17
(
68
%
)
during
5-FU
infusion
(
P
less
than
.002
)
.

The
incidence
of
ischemic
episodes
per
patient
per
hour
was
0.05
+
/-

0.02
prior
to
5-FU
infusion
v
0.13
+
/-
0.03
during
5-FU
infusion
(
P
less
than
.001
)
;
the
duration
of
ECG
changes
was
0.6
+
/-
0.3
minutes
per
patient
per
hour
before

5-FU

v
1.9
+
/-

0.5
minutes
per
patient
per
hour
during
5-FU

(
P
less
than
.01
)
.

ECG
changes
were
more
common
among
patients
with
known
coronary
artery
disease
.

There
were
two
cases
of
sudden
death
,
both
of
which
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
chemotherapy
course
.

We
conclude
that
5-FU
infusion
is
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
silent
ST
segment
deviation
suggestive
of
ischemia
,
particularly
among
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
.

The
mechanism
and
clinical
significance
of
these
ECG
changes
remain
to
be
determined
.

Lethal
anuria

complicating
high
dose
ifosfamide
chemotherapy
in
a
breast
cancer
patient
with
an
impaired
renal
function
.

A
sixty
-
year
-
old
woman
with
advanced
breast
cancer
,
previously
treated
with
cisplatin
,
developed
an
irreversible
lethal
renal
failure
with
anuria
,
the
day
after
5
g
/
m2
bolus
ifosfamide
.

Postrenal
failure
was
excluded
by
echography
.

A
prerenal
component
could
have
contributed
to
renal
failure
because
of
a
transient
hypotension
,
due
to
an
increasing
ascitis
,
occurring
just
before
anuria
.

However
,
correction
of
the
hemodynamic
parameters
did
not
improve
renal
function
.

Ifosfamide
is
a
known
nephrotoxic
drug
with
demonstrated
tubulopathies
.

We
strongly
suspect
that
this
lethal
anuria
was
mainly
due
to
ifosfamide
,
occurring
in
a
patient
having
received
previous
cisplatin
chemotherapy
and
with
poor
kidney
perfusion
due
to
transient
hypotension
.

We
recommend
careful
use
of
ifosfamide
in
patients
pretreated
with
nephrotoxic
chemotherapy
and
inadequate
renal
perfusion
.

Central
vein
thrombosis
and
topical
dipivalyl
epinephrine
.

A
report
is
given
on
an
83-year
-
old
female
who
acquired
central
vein
thrombosis
in
her
seeing
eye
one
day
after
having
started
topical
medication
with
dipivalyl
epinephrine
for
advanced
glaucoma
discovered
in
the
other
eye
.

From
present
knowledge
about
the
effects
of
adrenergic
eye
drops
on
ocular
blood
circulation
,
it
is
difficult
to
suggest
an
association
between
the
two
events
,
which
may
be
coincidental
only
.

Amelioration
of
bendrofluazide
-induced

hypokalemia
by
timolol
.

The
beta
adrenergic
blocking
drug
,
timolol
,
tended
to
correct
the
hypokalemia
of
short
-
term
bendrofluazide
treatment
in
6
healthy
male
subjects
and
although
the
effect
was
small
it
was
significant
.

Timolol
also
reduced
the
rise
in
plasma
aldosterone
and
urine
potassium
excretion
following
bendrofluazide
and
increased
the
urine
sodium
/
potassium
ratio
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
a
shift
of
potassium
from
the
intracellular
to
the
extracellular
space
.

A
cross
-
sectional
evaluation
of
the
effect
of
risperidone
and
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
on
bone
mineral
density
in
boys
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
effect
of
risperidone
-induced

hyperprolactinemia
on
trabecular
bone
mineral
density
(
BMD
)
in
children
and
adolescents
.

METHOD
:

Medically
healthy

7-
to
17-year
-
old
males
chronically
treated
,
in
a
naturalistic
setting
,
with
risperidone
were
recruited
for
this
cross
-
sectional
study
through
child
psychiatry
outpatient
clinics
between
November
2005
and
June
2007
.

Anthropometric
measurements
and
laboratory
testing
were
conducted
.

The
clinical
diagnoses
were
based
on
chart
review
,
and
developmental
and
treatment
history
was
obtained
from
the
medical
record
.

Volumetric
BMD
of
the
ultradistal
radius
was
measured
using
peripheral
quantitative
computed
tomography
,
and
areal
BMD
of
the
lumbar
spine
was
estimated
using
dual
-
energy
x
-
ray
absorptiometry
.

RESULTS
:

Hyperprolactinemia
was
present
in
49
%
of
83
boys
(
n
=
41
)
treated
with
risperidone
for
a
mean
of
2.9
years
.

Serum
testosterone

concentration
increased
with
pubertal
status
but
was
not
affected
by
hyperprolactinemia
.

As
expected
,
bone
mineral
content
and
BMD
increased
with
sexual
maturity
.

After
adjusting
for
the
stage
of
sexual
development
and
height
and
BMI
z
scores
,
serum
prolactin
was
negatively
associated
with
trabecular
volumetric
BMD
at
the
ultradistal
radius
(
P
.03
)
.

Controlling
for
relevant
covariates
,
we
also
found
treatment
with
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
to
be
associated
with
lower
trabecular
BMD
at
the
radius
(
P
=
.03
)
and
BMD
z
score
at
the
lumbar
spine
(
P
.05
)
.

These
findings
became
more
marked
when
the
analysis
was
restricted
to
non
-
Hispanic
white
patients
.

Of
13
documented
fractures
,
3
occurred
after
risperidone
and
SSRIs
were
started
,
and
none
occurred
in
patients
with
hyperprolactinemia
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
is
the
first
study
to
link
risperidone

-induced

hyperprolactinemia
and
SSRI
treatment
to
lower
BMD
in
children
and
adolescents
.

Future
research
should
evaluate
the
longitudinal
course
of
this
adverse
event
to
determine
its
temporal
stability
and
whether
a
higher
fracture
rate
ensues
.

Seizures
associated
with
levofloxacin
:
case
presentation
and
literature
review
.

PURPOSE
:

We
present
a
case
of
a
patient
who
developed
seizures
shortly
after
initiating
treatment
with
levofloxacin
and
to
discuss
the
potential
drug
-
drug
interactions
related
to
the
inhibition
of
cytochrome
P450
(
CYP
)

1A2
in
this
case
,
as
well
as
in
other
cases
,
of
levofloxacin

-induced

seizures
.

METHODS
:

Several
biomedical
databases
were
searched
including
MEDLINE
,
Cochrane
and
Ovid
.

The
main
search
terms
utilized
were
case
report
and
levofloxacin
.

The
search
was
limited
to
studies
published
in
English
.

RESULTS
:

Six
cases
of
levofloxacin
-induced
seizures
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
.

Drug
-
drug
interactions
related
to
the
inhibition
of
CYP1A2
by
levofloxacin
are
likely
involved
in
the
clinical
outcome
of
these
cases
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Clinicians
are
exhorted
to
pay
close
attention
when
initiating
levofloxacin
therapy
in
patients
taking
medications
with
epileptogenic
properties
that
are
CYP1A2
substrates
.

Mice
lacking
mPGES-1
are
resistant
to
lithium

-induced
polyuria
.

Cyclooxygenase-2
activity
is
required
for
the
development
of
lithium
-induced
polyuria
.

However
,
the
involvement
of
a
specific
,
terminal
prostaglandin

(
PG
)
isomerase
has
not
been
evaluated
.

The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
assess

lithium
-induced

polyuria
in
mice
deficient
in
microsomal
prostaglandin
E

synthase-1
(

mPGES-1
)
.

A
2-wk
administration
of
LiCl

(
4
mmol.kg(-1).day(-1
)

ip
)
in
mPGES-1
+

/+
mice
led
to
a
marked
polyuria
with
hyposmotic
urine
.

This
was
associated
with
elevated
renal
mPGES-1
protein
expression
and
increased
urine
PGE(2
)
excretion
.

In
contrast
,
mPGES-1
-/-
mice
were
largely
resistant
to
lithium
-induced
polyuria
and
a
urine
concentrating
defect
,
accompanied
by
nearly
complete
blockade
of
high
urine
PGE(2
)
and
cAMP
output
.

Immunoblotting
,
immunohistochemistry
,
and
quantitative
(
q
)
RT
-
PCR
consistently
detected
a
significant
decrease
in
aquaporin-2
(
AQP2
)
protein
expression
in
both
the
renal
cortex
and
medulla
of

lithium
-treated

+
/+
mice
.

This
decrease
was
significantly
attenuated
in
the
-/-
mice
.

qRT
-
PCR
detected
similar
patterns
of
changes
in
AQP2
mRNA
in
the
medulla
but
not
in
the
cortex
.

Similarly
,
the
total
protein
abundance
of
the
Na
-
K
-2

Cl

cotransporter
(
NKCC2
)
in
the
medulla
but
not
in
the
cortex
of
the
+
/+

mice
was
significantly
reduced
by
lithium
treatment
.

In
contrast
,
the
dowregulation
of
renal
medullary
NKCC2
expression
was
significantly
attenuated
in
the
-/-
mice
.

We
conclude
that
mPGES-1-derived
PGE(2
)
mediates

lithium
-induced

polyuria
likely
via
inhibition
of
AQP2
and
NKCC2
expression
.

Identification
of
a
simple
and
sensitive
microplate
method
for
the
detection
of
oversulfated
chondroitin
sulfate
in
heparin
products
.

Heparin
is
a
commonly
implemented
anticoagulant
used
to
treat
critically
ill
patients
.

Recently
,
a
number
of
commercial
lots
of
heparin
products
were
found
to
be
contaminated
with
an
oversulfated
chondroitin
sulfate

(
OSCS
)
derivative
that
could
elicit
a
hypotensive
response
in
pigs
following
a
single
high
-
dose
infusion
.

Using
both
contaminated
heparin
products
and
the
synthetically
produced
derivative

,
we
showed
that
the
OSCS
produces
dose
-
dependent
hypotension
in
pigs
.

The
no
observed
effect
level
(
NOEL
)
for
this
contaminant
appears
to
be
approximately
1mg
/
kg
,
corresponding
to
a
contamination
level
of
approximately
3
%
.

We
also
demonstrated
that
OSCS
can
be
identified
in
heparin
products
using
a
simple
,
inexpensive
,
commercially
available
heparin
enzyme
immunoassay
(
EIA
)
kit
that
has
a
limit
of
detection
of
approximately
0.1
%
,
well
below
the
NOEL
.

This
kit
may
provide
a
useful
method
to
test
heparin
products
for
contamination
with
oversulfated
GAG
derivatives
.

Doxorubicin

cardiomyopathy
-induced

inflammation
and

.

Clinical
use
of
the
anthracycline
doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
is
limited
by
its
cardiotoxic
effects
,
which
are
attributed
to
the
induction
of

.

To
elucidate
the
possible
role
of
the
kinin

(
B1R
)
during
the
development
of
DOX

cardiomyopathy
,
we
studied
B1R
knockout
mice
(
B1R(-/-
)
)
by
investigating
cardiac
inflammation
and
apoptosis
after
induction
of
DOX
-induced
cardiomyopathy
.

DOX
control
mice
showed
cardiac
dysfunction

measured
by
pressure
-
volume
loops
in
vivo
.

This
was
associated
with
a
reduced
activation
state
of
AKT
,
as
well
as
an
increased
bax
/
bcl2
ratio
in
Western
blots
,
indicating
cardiac
apoptosis
.

Furthermore
,
mRNA
levels
of
the
proinflammatory
cytokine
interleukin
6
were
increased
in
the
cardiac
tissue
.

In
DOX
B1R(-/-
)
mice
,
cardiac
dysfunction
was
improved
compared
to
DOX
control
mice
,
which
was
associated
with
normalization
of
the
bax
/
bcl-2
ratio
and
interleukin
6
,
as
well
as
AKT
activation
state
.

These
findings
suggest
that
B1R
is
detrimental
in
DOX

cardiomyopathy

in
that
it
mediates
the
inflammatory
response
and
apoptosis
.

These
insights
might
have
useful
implications
for
future
studies
utilizing
B1R
antagonists
for
treatment
of
human
DOX
cardiomyopathy
.

Hepatotoxicity
associated
with
sulfasalazine
in
inflammatory
arthritis
:

A
case
series
from
a
local
surveillance
of
serious
adverse
events
.

BACKGROUND
:

Spontaneous
reporting
systems
for
adverse
drug
reactions
(
ADRs
)
are
handicapped
by
under
-
reporting
and
limited
detail
on
individual
cases
.

We
report
an
investigation
from
a
local
surveillance
for
serious
adverse
drug
reactions
associated
with
disease
modifying
anti
-
rheumatic
drugs
that
was
triggered
by
the
occurrence
of
liver
failure
in
two
of
our
patients
.

METHODS
:

Serious
ADR
reports
have
been
solicited
from
local
clinicians
by
regular
postcards
over
the
past
seven
years
.

Patients
'
,
who
had
hepatotoxicity
on
sulfasalazine
and
met
a
definition
of
a
serious
ADR
,
were
identified
.

Two
clinicians
reviewed
structured
case
reports
and
assessed
causality
by
consensus
and
by
using
a
causality
assessment
instrument
.

The
likely
frequency
of
hepatotoxicity
with
sulfasalazine
was
estimated
by
making
a
series
of
conservative
assumptions
.

RESULTS
:

Ten
cases
were
identified
:
eight
occurred
during
surveillance
.

Eight
patients
were
hospitalised
,
two
in

hepatic
failure
-
one
died
after
a
liver
transplant
.

All
but
one
event
occurred
within
6
weeks
of
treatment
.

Seven
patients
had
a
skin
rash
,
three
eosinophilia
and
one
interstitial
nephritis
.

Five
patients
were
of
Black
British
of
African
or
Caribbean
descent
.

Liver
enzymes
showed
a
hepatocellular
pattern
in
four
cases
and
a
mixed
pattern
in
six
.

Drug
-
related

hepatotoxicity
was
judged
probable
or
highly
probable
in
8
patients
.

The
likely
frequency
of
serious
hepatotoxicity
with
sulfasalazine
was
estimated
at
0.4
%
of
treated
patients
.

CONCLUSION
:

Serious
hepatotoxicity
associated
with
sulfasalazine
appears
to
be
under
-
appreciated
and
intensive
monitoring
and
vigilance
in
the
first
6
weeks
of
treatment
is
especially
important
.

An
evaluation
of
amikacin
nephrotoxicity
in
the
hematology
/
oncology
population
.

Amikacin
is
an
aminoglycoside
commonly
used
to
provide
empirical
double
gram
-
negative
treatment
for
febrile
neutropenia
and
other
suspected
infections
.

Strategies
of
extended
-
interval
and
conventional
dosing
have
been
utilized
extensively
in
the
general
medical
population
;
however
,
data
are
lacking
to
support
a
dosing
strategy
in
the
hematology
/
oncology
population
.

To
evaluate
amikacin
-associated
nephrotoxicity
in
an
adult
hematology
/
oncology
population
,
a
prospective
,
randomized
,
open
-
label
trial
was
conducted
at
a
university
-
affiliated
medical
center
.

Forty
patients
with
a
diagnosis
consistent
with
a
hematologic
/
oncologic
disorder
that
required
treatment
with
an
aminoglycoside
were
randomized
to
either
conventional
or
extended
-
interval
amikacin
.

The
occurrence
of
nephrotoxicity
by
means
of
an
increase
in
serum
creatinine
and
evaluation
of
efficacy
via
amikacin
serum
concentrations
with
respective
pathogens
were
assessed
.

The
occurrence
of
nephrotoxicity
was
similar
between
the
conventional
and
extended
-
interval
groups
,
at
10
%
and
5
%
,
respectively
(
P
=
1.00
)
.

Six
patients
in
the
conventional
group
had
a
positive
culture
,
compared
with
none
in
the
extended
-
interval
group
(
P
=
0.002
)
.

The
occurrence
of
nephrotoxicity
was
similar
between
the
two
dosing
regimens
,
but
the
distribution
of
risk
factors
was
variable
between
the
two
groups
.

Efficacy
could
not
be
assessed
.

Memory
function
and
serotonin
transporter
promoter
gene
polymorphism
in
ecstasy

(
MDMA
)
users
.

Although
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine

(
MDMA
or
ecstasy
)
has
been
shown
to
damage
brain
serotonin

(
5-HT
)
neurons
in
animals
and
possibly
humans
,
little
is
known
about
the
long
-
term
consequences
of
MDMA
-induced
5-HT
neurotoxic
lesions
on
functions
in
which
5-HT
is
involved
,
such
as
cognitive
function
.

Because
5-HT
transporters
play
a
key
element
in
the
regulation
of
synaptic
5-HT
transmission
it
may
be
important
to
control
for
the
potential
covariance
effect
of
a
polymorphism
in
the
5-HT
transporter
promoter
gene
region
(
5-HTTLPR
)
when
studying
the
effects
of
MDMA
as
well
as
cognitive
functioning
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
investigate
the
effects
of
moderate
and
heavy
MDMA
use
on
cognitive
function
,
as
well
as
the
effects
of
long
-
term
abstention
from
MDMA
,
in
subjects
genotyped
for
5-HTTLPR
.

A
second
aim
of
the
study
was
to
determine
whether
these
effects
differ
for
females
and
males
.

Fifteen
moderate
MDMA
users
(
55
lifetime
tablets
)
,
22
heavy
MDMA
+
users

(
>
55
lifetime
tablets
)
,

16
ex-

MDMA
+
users

(
last
tablet
>
1
year
ago
)
and
13
controls
were
compared
on
a
battery
of
neuropsychological
tests
.

DNA
from
peripheral
nuclear
blood
cells
was
genotyped
for
5-HTTLPR
using
standard
polymerase
chain
reaction
methods
.

A
significant
group
effect
was
observed
only
on
memory
function
tasks
(
p
=
0.04
)
but
not
on
reaction
times
(
p
=
0.61
)
or
attention
/
executive
functioning
(
p
=
0.59
)
.

Heavy
and
ex-

MDMA
+
users
performed
significantly
poorer
on
memory
tasks
than
controls
.

In
contrast
,
no
evidence
of
memory
impairment
was
observed
in
moderate
MDMA
users
.

No
significant
effect
of
5-HTTLPR
or
gender
was
observed
.

While
the
use
of
MDMA
in
quantities
that
may
be
considered
"
moderate
"
is
not
associated
with
impaired
memory
functioning
,
heavy
use
of
MDMA
use

may
lead
to
long
lasting
memory
impairments
.

No
effect
of
5-HTTLPR
or
gender
on
memory
function
or
MDMA
use
was
observed
.

Aging
process
of
epithelial
cells
of
the
rat
prostate
lateral
lobe
in
experimental
hyperprolactinemia
induced
by
haloperidol
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
examine
the
influence
of
hyperprolactinemia
,
induced
by
haloperidol

(
HAL
)
on
age
related
morphology
and
function
changes
of
epithelial
cells
in
rat
prostate
lateral

.

The
study
was
performed
on
sexually
mature
male
rats
.

Serum
concentrations
of
prolactin
(
PRL
)
and
testosterone

(
T
)
were
measured
.

Tissue
sections
were
evaluated
with
light
and
electron
microscopy
.

Immunohistochemical
reactions
for
Anti

Proliferating
Cell
Nuclear
Antigen
(
PCNA
)
were
performed
.

In
rats
of
the
experimental
group
,
the
mean
concentration
of
:
PRL
was
more
than
twice
higher
,
whereas
T
concentration
was
almost
twice
lower
than
that
in
the
control
group
.

Light
microscopy
visualized
the
following
:
hypertrophy
and
epithelium
hyperplasia
of
the
glandular
ducts
,
associated
with
increased
PCNA
expression
.

Electron

Does
supplemental

vitamin
C
increase
cardiovascular
disease
risk
in
women
with
diabetes
?

BACKGROUND
:

Vitamin
C
acts
as
a
potent
antioxidant
;
however
,
it
can
also
be
a
prooxidant
and
glycate
protein
under
certain
circumstances
in
vitro
.

These
observations
led
us
to
hypothesize
that
a
high
intake
of
vitamin
C
in
diabetic
persons
might
promote
atherosclerosis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
objective
was
to
examine
the
relation
between
vitamin
C
intake
and
mortality
from
cardiovascular
disease
.

DESIGN
:

We
studied
the
relation
between
vitamin
C
intake
and
mortality
from
total
cardiovascular
disease

(
n
=
281
)
,
coronary
artery
disease
(
n
=
175
)
,
and
stroke

(
n
=
57
)
in
1923
postmenopausal
women
who
reported
being
diabetic
at
baseline
.

Diet
was
assessed
with
a
food
-
frequency
questionnaire
at
baseline
,
and
subjects
initially
free
of
coronary
artery
disease
were
prospectively
followed
for
15
y.
RESULTS
:

After
adjustment
for
cardiovascular
disease
risk
factors
,
type
of

diabetes
medication
used
,
duration
of
diabetes
,
and
intakes
of
folate
,
vitamin
E
,
and
beta
-
carotene
,

the
adjusted
relative
risks
of
total
cardiovascular
disease
mortality
were
1.0
,
0.97
,
1.11
,
1.47
,
and
1.84
(
P
for
trend
0.01
)
across
quintiles
of
total
vitamin
C
intake
from
food
and
supplements
.

Adjusted
relative
risks
of
coronary
artery
disease
were
1.0
,
0.81
,
0.99
,
1.26
,
and
1.91
(
P
for
trend
=
0.01
)
and
of
stroke
were
1.0
,
0.52
,
1.23
,
2.22
,
and
2.57
(
P
for
trend
0.01
)
.

When
dietary
and
supplemental
vitamin
C
were
analyzed
separately
,
only
supplemental
vitamin
C
showed
a
positive
association
with
mortality
endpoints
.

Vitamin
C
intake
was
unrelated
to
mortality
from
cardiovascular
disease
in
the
nondiabetic
subjects
at
baseline
.

CONCLUSION
:

A
high
vitamin
C
intake
from
supplements
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
cardiovascular
disease
mortality
in
postmenopausal
women
with
diabetes
.

Absolute
and
attributable
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
in
women
on
combined
cyproterone
acetate
and
ethinylestradiol
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
achieve
absolute
risk
estimates
of
venous
thromboembolism

(
VTE
)
among
women
on
cyproterone
acetate
plus
ethinylestradiol

(
CPA
/
EE
)
,
and
among
women
on
combined
oral
contraceptives

(
COCs
)
.

METHODS
:

From
the
Danish
National
Register
of
Patients
(
NRP
)
,
1996
to
1998
,
the
records
of
1.1
million
Danish
women
,
ages
15
to
44
years
,
were
searched
for
evidence
of
VTE
.

COC
use
was
ascertained
through
mailed
questionnaires
.

Sales
statistics
of
COCs
and
CPA
/
EE
were
provided
through
Danish
Drug
Statistics
.

RESULTS
:

During
the
time
frame
of
the
study
,
330
women
were
found
to
have
had
VTE
while
on
COCs
.

Of
these
women
,
67
were
on
levonorgestrel

-containing
COCs
.

Eleven
were
on
CPA
/
EE
.

The
corresponding
absolute
risk
of
VTE
was
3.4
(
range
,
3.1
-
3.8
)
per
10
000
women
years
among
the
women
on
COCs
,
4.2
(
range
,
3.2
-
5.2
)
per
10
000
women
years
among
women
on

levonorgestrel
-containing
COCs
,
and
3.1
(
range
,
1.3
-
4.9
)
per
10
000
women
years
among
the
women
on
CPA
/
EE
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
results
suggest
the
absolute
risk
of
VTE
among
Danish
women
on
COCs
is
similar
to
that
among
women
taking
CPA
/
EE
.

Effect
of
lindane
on
hepatic
and
brain
cytochrome
P450s
and
influence
of
P450
modulation
in
lindane
induced
neurotoxicity
.

Oral
administration
of
lindane

(
2.5
,
5
,
10
and
15
mg
/
kg
,
body
weight
)
for
5
days
was
found
to
produce
a
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
the
activity
of
P450
dependent
7-ethoxyresorufin
-
O
-
deethylase
(
EROD
)
,
7-pentoxyresorufin
-
O
-
dealkylase
(
PROD
)
and
N
-
nitrosodimethylamine
demethylase
(
NDMA
-d
)
in
rat
brain
and
liver
.

A
significant
increase
in
the
hepatic
and
brain
P450
monooxygenases
was
also
observed
when
the
duration
of
exposure
of
low
dose
(
2.5
mg
/
kg
)
of
lindane
was
increased
from
5
days
to
15
or
21
days
.

As
observed
with
different
doses
,
the
magnitude
of
induction
in
the
activity
of
P450
monooxygenases
was
several
fold
higher
in
liver
microsomes
when
compared
with
the
brain
.

Western
blotting
studies
have
indicated
that
the
increase
in
the
P450
enzymes
could
be
due
to
the
increase
in
the
expression
of
P450
1A1/1A2
,
2B1/2B2
and
2E1
isoenzymes
.

In
vitro
studies
using
organic
inhibitors
specific
for
individual
P450
isoenzymes
and
antibody
inhibition
experiments
have
further
demonstrated
that
the
increase
in
the
activity
of
PROD
,
EROD
and
NDMA
-d
are
due
to
the
increase
in
the
levels
of
P450
2B1/2B2
,
1A1/1A2
and
2E1
isoenzymes
,
respectively
.

Induction
studies
have
further
shown
that
while
pretreatment
of
3-methylcholanthrene

(
MC
)
,
an
inducer
of
P4501A1/1A2
,
did
not
produce
any
significant
effect
in
the
incidence
of
lindane
induced
convulsions
,
pretreatment
with
phenobarbital

(
PB
)
,
an
inducer
of
P450
2B1/2B2
or
ethanol
,
an
inducer
of
P450
2E1
catalysed
reactions
,
significantly
increased
the
incidence
of
lindane
induced
convulsions
.

Similarly
,
when
the
P450-mediated
metabolism
of
lindane
was
blocked
by
cobalt
chloride
incidence
of
convulsions
was
increased
in
animals
treated
with

lindane
indicating
that
lindane
per
se
or
its
metabolites
formed
by
PB
or
ethanol
inducible
P450
isoenzymes
are
involved
in
its
neurobehavioral
toxicity
.

Seizure
associated
with
sleep
deprivation
and
sustained
-
release
bupropion
.

This
case
report
describes
a
generalized
seizure
associated
with
sustained
-
release
bupropion
use
and
sleep
deprivation
.

The
subject
,
a
31-year
-
old
female
smoker
,
was
participating
in
a
clinical
trial
evaluating
an
investigational
medication
for
smoking
cessation
that
used
sustained
-
release
bupropion
as
an
active
control
.

After
5
weeks
of
bupropion
use
,
the
subject
experienced
a
generalized
tonic
clonic
seizure
after
staying
up
nearly
all
night
packing
and
moving
to
a
new
residence
.

The
patient
had
no
other
risk
factors
for
seizures
.

We
suggest
that
sleep
deprivation
may
add
to
the
risk
of
bupropion

-associated

seizures
.

Nephrotoxic
effects
in
high
-
risk
patients
undergoing
angiography
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
use
of
iodinated
contrast
medium
can
result
in
nephropathy
.

Whether
iso
-
osmolar
contrast
medium
is
less
nephrotoxic
than
low
-
osmolar
contrast
medium
in
high
-
risk
patients
is
uncertain
.

METHODS
:

We
conducted
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
prospective
,
multicenter
study
comparing
the
nephrotoxic
effects
of
an
iso
-
osmolar
,
dimeric
,
nonionic
contrast
medium
,
iodixanol
,
with
those
of
a
low
-
osmolar
,
nonionic
,
monomeric
contrast
medium
,
iohexol
.

The
study
involved
129
patients
with
diabetes
with
serum

creatinine
concentrations
of
1.5
to
3.5
mg
per
deciliter
who
underwent
coronary
or
aortofemoral
angiography
.

The
primary
end
point
was
the
peak
increase
from
base
line
in
the
creatinine
concentration
during
the
three
days
after
angiography
.

Other
end
points
were
an
increase
in
the
creatinine
concentration
of
0.5
mg
per
deciliter
or
more
,
an
increase
of
1.0
mg
per
deciliter
or
more
,
and
a
change
in
the
creatinine
concentration
from
day
0
to
day
7
.

RESULTS
:

The
creatinine
concentration
increased
significantly
less
in
patients
who
received
iodixanol
.

From
day
0
to

,
the
mean
peak
increase
in
creatinine
was
0.13
mg
per
deciliter
in
the
iodixanol
group
and
0.55
mg
per
deciliter
in
the
iohexol
group
(

the
increase

)
.

Two
of
the
64
patients
in
the

(
3

)
had
an
increase
in
the
creatinine
concentration
of
0.5
mg
per

or
more
,
as
compared
with
17
of
the
65

)
.

No
patient
receiving
iodixanol
had
an

or
more
,
but
10
patients
in

did
.

The
mean
change
in

was
0.07

.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Nephropathy
induced
by

may
be
less
likely
to
develop

Experimental
cranial
pain
elicited
by
capsaicin
:
a
PET
study
.

Using
a
positron
emission
tomography
(
PET
)
study
it
was
shown
recently
that
in
migraine
without
aura
certain
areas
in
the
brain
stem
were
activated
during
the
headache
state
,
but
not
in
the
headache
free
interval
.

It
was
suggested
that
this
brain
stem
activation
is
inherent
to
the
migraine
attack
itself
and
represents
the
so
called
'
migraine
generator
'
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
we
performed
an
experimental
pain
study
in
seven
healthy
volunteers
,
using
the
same
positioning
in
the
PET
scanner
as
in
the
migraine
patients
.

A
small
amount
of
capsaicin
was
administered
subcutaneously
in
the
right
forehead
to
evoke
a
burning
painful
sensation
in
the
first
division
of
the
trigeminal
nerve
.

Increases
of
regional
cerebral
blood
flow
(
rCBF
)
were
found
bilaterally
in
the
insula
,
in
the
anterior
cingulate
cortex
,
the
cavernous
sinus
and
the
cerebellum
.

Using
the
same
stereotactic
space
limits
as
in
the
above
mentioned

migraine
study
no
brain
stem
activation
was
found
in
the
acute
pain
state
compared
to
the
pain
free
state
.

The
increase
of
activation
in
the
region
of
the
cavernous
sinus
however
,
suggests
that
this
structure
is
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
trigeminal
transmitted

pain
as
such
,
rather
than
in
a
specific
type
of
headache
as
was
suggested
for
cluster
headache
.

Neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
with
risperidone
.

Neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
is
thought
to
be
a
result
of
dopamine
D2
receptor
blockade
in
the
striatum
of
the
basal
ganglia
.

Risperidone
,
a
benzisoxazole
derivative
antipsychotic
,
has
high
serotonin
5-HT2
receptor
blockade
and
dose
-
related
D2
receptor
blockade
.

The
high
ratio
is
believed
to
impart
the
low
frequency
of
extrapyramidal
symptoms
with
risperidone
at
low
dosages
.

With
this
low
frequency
of
extrapyramidal
symptoms
,
it
was
thought
the
frequency
of
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
might
also
be
lowered
.

A
73-year
-
old
woman
developed
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
after
monotherapy
with
risperidone
.

The
syndrome
reversed
after
discontinuing
risperidone
and
starting
treatment
with
dantrolene
and
bromocriptine
.

It
appears
that
the
protection
from
extrapyramidal
side
effects
observed
with
risperidone
does
not
ensure
protection
from
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
.

Hepatic
and
extrahepatic
angiotensinogen
gene
expression
in
rats
with
acute
nephrotic
syndrome
.

Plasma
concentration
and
urine
excretion
of
the
renin-
angiotensin
system
proteins
are
altered
in
rats
with
nephrotic
syndrome

(
NS
)
.

In
this
work
the
messenger
ribonucleic
acid
(
mRNA
)
levels
of
angiotensinogen
(
Ao
)
were
analyzed
with
the
slot
-
blot
hybridization
technique
in
liver
and
other
extrahepatic
tissues
:
kidney
,
heart
,
brain
,
and
adrenal
gland
from
control
,
nephrotic
,
and
pair
-
fed
(
PF
)
rats
.

NS
was
induced
by
a
single
injection
of
puromycin
amino
-
nucleoside

(
PAN
)
.

Although
a
great
urinary
excretion
and
half
-
normal
plasma
levels
of
Ao
were
observed
on
day
6
after
PAN
injection
,
when
NS
was
clearly
established
,
hepatic
Ao
mRNA
levels
did
not
change
.

Furthermore
,
the
Ao
mRNA
levels
did
not
change
in
any
of
the
extrahepatic
tissues
studied
on
day
6
,
nor
did
its
hepatic
levels
at
days
1
,
3
,
5
,
or
7
after
PAN
injection
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
hepatic
and
extrahepatic
Ao
mRNA
levels
are
unaltered
during
the
development
of
the
acute
NS
induced
by
PAN
.

Cyclophosphamide
associated

bladder
cancer
--a

highly
aggressive
disease
:
analysis
of
12
cases
.

PURPOSE
:

We
gained
knowledge
of
the
etiology
,
treatment
and
prevention
of
cyclophosphamide
associated
urothelial
cancer
.
MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

The
medical
records
of
6
men
and
6
women
(
mean
age
55
years
)
with
cyclophosphamide
associated
bladder
cancer
were
reviewed
.

RESULTS
:

All
tumors
were
grade
3
or
4
transitional
cell
carcinoma
.

Of
the
5
patients
initially
treated
with
endoscopic
resection
alone
only
1
is
alive
without
disease
.

Of
the
6
patients
who
underwent
early
cystectomy
4
were
alive
at
24
to
111
months
.

The
remaining
patient
with
extensive
cancer
underwent
partial
cystectomy
for
palliation
and
died
3
months
later
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Cyclophosphamide
associated

bladder
tumor
is
an
aggressive
disease
.

However
,
long
-
term
survival
is
possible
when
radical
cystectomy
is
performed
for
bladder
tumors
with
any
sign
of
invasion
and
for
recurrent
high
grade
disease
,
even
when
noninvasive

Leg
and
back
pain
after
spinal
anaesthesia
involving
hyperbaric
5
%
lignocaine
.

Fifty
-
four
patients
,
aged
27
-
90
years
,
who
were
given
lignocaine
5
%
in
6.8
%
glucose
solution
for
spinal
anaesthesia
were
studied
.

Thirteen
of
these
patients
experienced
pain
in
the
legs
and/or
back
after
recovery
from
anaesthesia
.

The
patients
affected
were
younger
(
p
0.05
)
and
the
site
of
the
dural
puncture
was
higher
(
p
0.01
)
than
those
individuals
without
pain
.

Five
of
the
13
patients
(
38
%
)
with
pain
and
seven
of
the
41
patients
(
17
%
)
without
pain
admitted
to
a
high
alcohol
intake
,
which
might
be
a
contributing
factor
.

Leg
and/or
back
pain
is
associated
with
the
intrathecal
use
of
hyperbaric
5
%
lignocaine
.

Acute
blood
pressure
elevations
with
caffeine
in
men
with
borderline
systemic
hypertension
.

Whether
the
vasoconstrictive
actions
of
caffeine
are
enhanced
in
hypertensive
persons
has
not
been
demonstrated
.

Thus
,
caffeine
(
3.3
mg
/
kg
)
versus
placebo
was
tested
in
48
healthy
men
(
aged
20
to
35
years
)
selected
after
screening
on
2
separate
occasions
.

Borderline
hypertensive

men
(
n
=
24
)
were
selected
with
screening
systolic
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
of
140
to
160
mm
Hg
and/or
diastolic
BP
90
to
99
mm
Hg
.

Low
-
risk
controls
(
n
=
24
)
reported
no
parental
history
of
hypertension
and
had
screening
BP
130/85
mm
Hg
.

Participants
were
then
tested
on
2
occasions
after
12-hour
abstinence
from
caffeine
in
each
of
2
protocols
;
this
required
a
total
of
4
laboratory
visits
.

Caffeine
-induced
changes
in
diastolic
BP
were
2
to
3
times
larger
in
borderline
subjects
than
in
controls
(
+
8.4
vs
+
3.8
mm
Hg
,
p
0.0001
)
,
and
were
attributable
to
larger
changes
in
impedance
-
derived
measures
of
systemic
vascular
resistance
(
+
135
vs
+
45
dynes.s.cm-5
,
p
0.004
)
.

These
findings
were
consistent
and
reached
significance
in
both
protocols
.

The
percentage
of
borderline
subjects
in
whom
diastolic
BP
changes
exceeded
the
median
control
response
was
96
%
.

Consequently
,
whereas
all
participants
exhibited
normotensive
levels
during
the
resting
predrug
baseline
,
33
%
of
borderline
subjects
achieved
hypertensive
BP
levels
after
caffeine
ingestion
.

Thus
,
in
borderline
hypertensive
men
,
exaggerated
responses
to
caffeine
were
:
selective
for
diastolic
BP
,
consistent
with
greater
vasoconstriction
,
replicated
in
2
protocols
,
and
representative
of
nearly
all
borderline
hypertensives
.

We
suspect
that
the
potential
for
caffeine
to
stabilize
high
resistance
states
in
susceptible
persons
suggests
that
its
use
may
facilitate
their
disease
progression
,
as
well
as
hinder
accurate
diagnosis
and
treatment
.

Hallucinations
and
ifosfamide
-induced

neurotoxicity
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hallucinations
as
a
symptom
of
central
neurotoxicity
are
a
known
but
poorly
described
side
effect
of
ifosfamide
.

Most
cases
of
ifosfamide
-induced
hallucinations
have
been
reported
with
other
mental
status
changes
.

METHODS
:

The
authors
interviewed
six
persons
with
ifosfamide
-induced

hallucinations
in
the
presence
of
a
clear
sensorium
.

All
patients
were
receiving
high
-
dose
ifosfamide
as
part
of
their
bone
marrow
transplant
procedure
.

RESULTS
:

Hallucinations
occurred
only
when
the
patient
's
eyes
were
closed
and
,
in
all
but
one
case
,
were
reported
as
disturbing
or
frightening
.

Underreporting
of
these
hallucinations
by
patients
is
likely
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Hallucinations
may
be
the
sole
or
first
manifestation
of
neurotoxicity
.

The
incidence
may
be
dose
and
infusion
-
time
related
.

The
clinician
should
be
alerted
for
possible
ifosfamide

-induced

hallucinations
,
which
may
occur
without
other
signs
of
neurotoxicity
.

"
Eyes
-
closed
"
hallucinatory
experiences
appear
to
be
an
unusual
feature
of
this
presentation
.

Patients
anxious
about
this
experience
respond
well
to
support
and
education
about
this
occurrence
.

Optimal
pharmacologic
management
of
disturbed
patients
is
unclear
.

If
agitation
becomes
marked
,
high
-
potency
neuroleptics
(
i.e.
,
haloperidol
)
may
be
effective
.

Chlorpropamide
-induced
optic
neuropathy
.

A
65-year
-
old
woman
with
adult
-
onset
diabetes
treated
with
chlorpropamide

(
Diabenese
)
had
a
toxic
optic
neuropathy
that
resolved
with
discontinuation
of
chlorpropamide
therapy
.

Visual
loss
occurs
in
diabetics
for
a
variety
of
reasons
,
and
accurate
diagnosis
is
necessary
to
institute
appropriate
therapy
.

The
possibility
of
a
drug
-
induced
optic
neuropathy
should
be
considered
in
the
differential
diagnosis
of
visual
loss
in
diabetics
.

Levodopa
-induced
dyskinesia
and
thalamotomy
.

Levodopa
-induced
dyskinesia
of
the
limbs
in
thirteen
cases
of
Parkinsonism
,
which
was
choreic
,
ballistic
or
dystonic
in
type
,
was
alleviated
almost
completely
by
stereotaxic
surgery
using
a
microelectrode
technique
for
the
ventralis
oralis
anterior
and
posterior
nuclei
of
the
thalamus
,
but
much
less
by
the
ventralis

nucleus
.

Control
of
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
by
thalamic
lesions
in
the
course
of
routine
treatment
of
Parkinsonism
is
discussed
.

Factors

Data
from

In

When
the

were
examined
individually
,
duration

correlated
significantly
(

In

identified
only

)
as
an

.

Based
on
this

,
the

Cardiac
transplantation
:
improved
quality
of
survival
with
a
modified
immunosuppressive
protocol
.

The
effects
on
renal
function
on
two
different
immunosuppressive
protocols
were
evaluated
retrospectively
in
two
subsequent
groups
of
heart
transplant
recipients
.

In
group
I
,
cyclosporine
was
given
before
the
procedure
at
a
loading
dose
of
17.5
mg
/
kg
and
then
continued
after
the
procedure
to
keep
a
whole
blood
level
about
1000
ng
/
ml
.

In
group
II
,
cyclosporine
was
started
only
after
the
procedure
at
a
lower
dosage
and
was
complemented
by
azathioprine
,
which
was
used
for
the
first
postoperative
week
.

Group
II
showed
a
better
perioperative
renal
function
as
determined
by
serum
blood
urea
nitrogen
and
serum
creatinine
levels
.

Group
II
also
showed
a
significant
decrease
of
chronic
nephrotoxicity
secondary
to
long
-
term
therapy
with
cyclosporine
.

Despite
this
improvement
in
late
renal
function
,
group
II
still
shows
a
slow
rise
in
serum
creatinine
.

We
think
that
even
these
lower
dosages
of
cyclosporine
can
cause
chronic
nephrotoxicity
and
that
further
modification
of
the
immunosuppressive
regimen
is
required
to
completely
abolish
this
toxic
side
effect
.

Reversible
cholestasis
with

bile
duct
injury
following
azathioprine
therapy
.

A
case
report
.

A
67-year
-
old
patient
,
with
primary
polymyositis
and
without
previous
evidence
of
liver
disease
,
developed
clinical
and
biochemical
features
of
severe
cholestasis
3
months
after
initiation
of
azathioprine
therapy
.

Liver
biopsy
showed
cholestasis
with
both
cytological
and
architectural
alterations
of
interlobular
bile
ducts
.

Azathioprine
withdrawal
resulted
after
7
weeks
in
the
resolution
of
clinical
and
biochemical
abnormalities
.

It
is
believed
that
this
is
the
first
reported
case
of
reversible
azathioprine
-induced

cholestasis
associated
with
histological
evidence
of
bile

,
respectively
.

Anesthesia
was
maintained
with
fentanyl
,

,
and
isoflurane
.

Hypotension
was
induced
for

increasing
the
isoflurane

concentration
to
maintain
a
mean

.

GFR
and
ERPF
decreased
with
the
induction

not
significantly
more
during

.

Postoperatively
,
ERPF
returned
to

,
whereas
GFR
was
higher
than

Renal
vascular
resistance
increased
during

but
decreased
when

was
induced
,
allowing
the
maintenance
of
renal

flow
.

We
conclude
that
renal
compensatory
mechanisms
are
preserved
during
isoflurane

that
renal

hemodynamics
quickly
return

The

,
extensive
(
EM
)
and
poor

,
show
different
stereoselective
metabolism
,
resulting
in
apparently
higher

potency
of

metoprolol
in
EMs
.

We
investigated
if
the
latter
also
applies
to
the
beta-2

antagonism
by
metoprolol
.

The
drug
effect
studied
was
the

By
using

Cefotetan
-induced
immune
hemolytic
anemia
.

Immune
hemolytic
anemia
due
to
a
drug
-
adsorption
mechanism
has
been
described
primarily
in
patients
receiving
penicillins
and
first
-
generation
cephalosporins
.

We
describe
a
patient
who
developed
anemia
while
receiving
intravenous
cefotetan
.

Cefotetan
-dependent
antibodies
were
detected
in
the
patient
's
serum
and
in
an
eluate
prepared
from
his
red
blood
cells
.

The
eluate
also
reacted
weakly
with
red
blood
cells
in
the
absence
of
cefotetan
,
suggesting
the
concomitant
formation
of
warm
-
reactive
autoantibodies
.

These
observations
,
in
conjunction
with
clinical
and
laboratory
evidence
of
extravascular
hemolysis
,
are
consistent
with
drug
-
induced
hemolytic
anemia
,
possibly
involving
both
drug
-
adsorption
and
autoantibody
formation
mechanisms
.

This
case
emphasizes
the
need
for
increased
awareness
of
hemolytic
reactions
to
all
cephalosporins
.

Acute
renal
failure
subsequent
to
the
administration
of
rifampicin
.

A
follow
-
up
study
of
cases
reported
earlier
.

A
clinical
presentation
is
made
of
a
2
-
3
year
follow
-
up
of
six
cases
of
acute
renal
failure
that
have
been
reported
earlier
.

The
patients
had
developed
transient
renal
failure
after
the
intermittent
administration
of
rifampicin
.

The
stage
of
olig-
anuria
lasted
for
1
-
3
weeks
,
and
five
of
the
patients
were
treated
by
hemodialysis
.

Two
of
the
patients
died
due
to
unrelated
causes
during
the
follow
-
up
period
.

The
four
patients
re
-
examined
were
clinically
cured
.

Pathologic
findings
by
light
microscopy
and
immunofluorescence
at
biopsy
were
scarce
.

Nothing
abnormal
was
seen
by
electron
microscopy
in
two
of
the
cases
studied
.

Renal
function
was
normal
.

In
three
cases
the
excretion
at
131I
-
hippuran
renography
was
slightly
slowed
.

Although
in
the
acute
stage
the
renal
lesions

histologically
appeared
toxic
,
evidence
suggestive
of
an
immunological
mechanism
can
not
be
excluded
.

Type
B
hepatitis
after
needle
-
stick
exposure
:
prevention
with
hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
.

Final
report
of
the
Veterans
Administration
Cooperative
Study
.

Hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
(
HBIG
)
and
immune
serum
globulin
(
ISG
)
were
examined
in
a
randomized
,
double
-
blind
trial
to
assess
their
relative
efficacies
in
preventing
type
B
hepatitis
after
needle
-
stick
exposure
to
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen

(
HBsAG
)
-positive
donors
.

Clinical
hepatitis
developed
in
1.4
%
of
HBIG
and
in
5.9
%
of
ISG
recipients
(
P
=
0.016
)
,
and
seroconversion
(
anti
-
HBs
)
occurred
in
5.6
%
and
20.7
%
of
them
respectively
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
.

Mild
and
transient
side
-
effects
were
noted
in
3.0
%
of
ISG
and
in
3.2
%
of
HBIG
recipients
.

Available
donor
sera
were
examined
for
DNA
polymerase
(
DNAP
)
and
e
antigen
and
antibody
(
HBeAg
;
anti
-
HBE
)
.

Both
DNAP
and
HBeAg
showed
a
highly
statistically
significant
correlation
with
the
infectivity
of
HBsAg
-positive
donors
.

Hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
remained
significantly
superior
to
ISG
in
preventing
type
B
hepatitis
even
when
the
analysis
was
confined
to
these
two
high
-
risk
subgroups
.

The
efficacy
of
ISG
in
preventing
type
B
hepatitis
can
not
be
ascertained
because
a
true
placebo
group
was
not
included
.

Serotonin
syndrome
from
venlafaxine
-
tranylcypromine
interaction
.

Excessive
stimulation
of
serotonin

5HT1A
receptors
causes
a
syndrome
of
serotonin

excess
that
consists
of
shivering
,
muscle
rigidity
,
salivation
,
confusion
,
agitation
and
hyperthermia
.

The
most
common
cause
of
this
syndrome
is
an
interaction
between
a
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitor
(
MAOI
)
and
a
specific
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
.

Venlafaxine
is
a
new
antidepressant
agent
that
inhibits
the
reuptake
of
serotonin
and
norepinephrine
.

We
report
a
venlafaxine

-MAOI
interaction
that
resulted
in
the
serotonin
syndrome
in
a
23-y
-
old
male
who
was
taking
tranylcypromine
for
depression
.

He
had
been
well
until
the
morning
of
presentation
when
he
took
1/2
tab
of
venlafaxine
.

Within
2
h
he
became
confused
with
jerking
movements
of
his
extremities
,
tremors
and
rigidity
.

He
was
brought
directly
to
a
hospital
where
he
was
found
to
be
agitated
and
confused
with
shivering
,
myoclonic
jerks
,
rigidity
,
salivation
and
diaphoresis
.

His
pupils
were
7
mm
and
sluggishly
reactive
to
light
.

Vital
signs
were
:
blood
pressure
120/67
mm
Hg
,
heart
rate

127/min
,
respiratory
rate
28/min
,
and
temperature
97
F.

After
180
mg
of
diazepam
i.v
.

he
remained
tremulous
with
muscle
rigidity
and
clenched
jaws
.

He
was
intubated
for
airway
protection
and
because
of
hypoventilation
,
and
was
paralyzed
to
control
muscle
rigidity
.

His
subsequent
course
was
remarkable
for
non
-
immune
thrombocytopenia
which
resolved
.

The
patient
's
maximal
temperature
was
101.2
F
and
his
CPK
remained
500
units
/
L
with
no
other
evidence
of
rhabdomyolysis
.

His
mental
status
normalized
and
he
was
transferred
to
a
psychiatry
ward
.

This
patient
survived
without
sequelae
due
to
the
aggressive
sedation
and
neuromuscular
paralysis
.

Effect
of
nondopaminergic
drugs
on
L
-
dopa
-induced

dyskinesias
in
MPTP
-treated
monkeys
.

A
group
of
four
monkeys
was
rendered

parkinsonian
with
the
toxin
MPTP
.

They
were
then
treated
chronically
with
L
-
DOPA
/
benserazide

50/12.5
mg
/
kg
given
orally
daily
for
2
months
.

This
dose
produced
a
striking
antiparkinsonian
effect
,
but
all
animals
manifested
dyskinesia
.

A
series
of
agents
acting
primarily
on
neurotransmitters
other
than
dopamine
were
then
tested
in
combination
with
L
-
DOPA
to
see
if
the
dyskinetic
movements
would
be
modified
.

Several
drugs
,
including
clonidine
,
physostigmine
,
methysergide
,
5-MDOT
,
propranolol
,
and
MK-801
,
markedly
reduced
the
dyskinetic
movements
but
at
the
cost
of
a
return
of
parkinsonian
symptomatology
.

However
,
yohimbine
and
meperidine
reduced
predominantly
the
dyskinetic
movements
.

Baclofen
was
also
useful
in
one
monkey
against
a
more
dystonic
form
of
dyskinesia
.

Atropine
converted
the
dystonic
movements
into
chorea
.

CCNU
(
lomustine
)
toxicity
in
dogs
:
a
retrospective
study
(
2002
-
07
)
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
the
incidence
of
haematological
,
renal
,
hepatic
and
gastrointestinal
toxicities
in
tumour
-
bearing
dogs
receiving
1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea

(
CCNU
)
.

DESIGN
:

The
medical
records
of
206
dogs
that
were
treated
with
CCNU
at
the
Melbourne
Veterinary
Specialist
Centre
between
February
2002
and
December
2007
were
retrospectively
evaluated
.

RESULTS
:

Of
the
206
dogs
treated
with
CCNU
,
185
met
the
inclusion
criteria
for
at
least
one
class
of
toxicity
.

CCNU
was
used
most
commonly
in
the
treatment
of
lymphoma
,
mast
cell
tumour
,
brain
tumour
,
histiocytic
tumours
and
epitheliotropic
lymphoma
.

Throughout
treatment
,
56.9
%
of
dogs
experienced
neutropenia
,
34.2
%
experienced
anaemia
and
14.2
%
experienced
thrombocytopenia
.

Gastrointestinal
toxicosis
was
detected
in
37.8
%
of
dogs
,
the
most
common
sign
of
which
was
vomiting
(
24.3
%
)
.

Potential
renal
toxicity
and
elevated
alanine
transaminase
(
ALT
)
concentration
were
reported
in
12.2
%
and
48.8
%
of
dogs
,
respectively
.

The
incidence
of
hepatic
failure
was
1.2
%
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

CCNU
-associated

toxicity
in
dogs
is
common
,
but
is
usually
not
life
threatening
.

Neuroactive
steroids
protect
against
pilocarpine
-
and
kainic
acid
-induced

seizures
and
status

in
mice
.

Several
structurally
related
metabolites
of
progesterone

(
3
alpha
-
hydroxy
pregnane-20-ones
)
and
deoxycorticosterone

(
3
alpha
-
hydroxy
pregnane-21-diol-20-ones
)
and
their
3
beta
-
epimers
were
evaluated
for
protective
activity
against
pilocarpine
-
,
kainic
acid
-
and
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
(
NMDA
)
-induced

seizures
in
mice
.

Steroids
with
the
3-hydroxy
group
in
the
alpha
-
position
and
5-H
in
the
alpha-
or
beta
-
configurations
were
highly
effective
in
protecting
against
pilocarpine

(
416
mg
/
kg
,
s.c.)-induced
limbic
motor
seizures
and
status
epilepticus
(
ED50
values
,
7.0
-
18.7
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
.

The
corresponding
epimers
with
the
3-hydroxy
group
in
the
beta
-
position
were
also
effective
but
less
potent
(
ED50
values
,
33.8
-
63.5
,
i.p
.
)
.

Although
the
neuroactive
steroids
were
considerably
less
potent
than
the
benzodiazepine
clonazepam
in
protecting
against
pilocarpine
seizures
,
steroids
with
the
5
alpha,3
alpha
-
configuration
had
comparable
or
higher
protective
index
values
(
TD50
for
motor
impairment
divided
by
ED50
for
seizure
protection
)
than
clonazepam
,
indicating
that
some
neuroactive
steroids
may
have
lower
relative
toxicity
.

Steroids
with
the
5
alpha,3
alpha-
or
5
beta,3
alpha
-
configurations
also
produced
a
dose
-
dependent
delay
in
the
onset
of
limbic
seizures
induced
by
kainic
acid

(
32
mg
/
kg
,
s.c
.
)
,
but
did
not
completely
protect
against
the
seizures
.

However
,
when
a
second
dose
of
the
steroid
was
administered
1
hr
after
the
first
dose
,
complete
protection
from
the
kainic
acid
-induced
limbic
seizures
and
status
epilepticus
was
obtained
.

The
steroids
also
caused
a
dose
-
dependent
delay
in
NMDA

(
257
mg
/
kg
,
s.c.)-induced
lethality
,
but
did
not
completely
protect
against
NMDA
seizures
or
lethality
.

We
conclude
that
neuroactive

steroids
are
highly
effective
in
protecting
against
pilocarpine
-
and
kainic
acid
-induced

seizures
and
status
epilepticus
in
mice
,
and
may
be
of
utility
in
the
treatment
of
some
forms
of
status
epilepticus
in
humans
.

,
N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic
acid
,
is
a
tight
-
binding
inhibitor
of
thymidylate
synthase
(
TS
)
whose
cytotoxicity
is
mediated
solely
through
the
inhibition
of
this
enzyme
.

Recent
preclinical
studies
have
focused
on
the
intracellular
formation
of
CB
3717
polyglutamates
.

Following
a
12-hour
exposure
of
L1210
cells
to
50
microM
[
3H
]
CB
3717
,
30
%
of
the
extractable
radioactivity
could
be
accounted
for
as
CB
3717
tetra-
and
pentaglutamate
,
as
determined
by
high
-
pressure
liquid
chromatography
(
HPLC
)
analyses
.

As
inhibitors
of
isolated
L1210
TS
,
CB
3717
di-
,
tri-
,
tetra-
and
pentaglutamate
are
26-
,
87-
,
119-
and
114-fold
more
potent
than
CB
3717
,
respectively
,
and
their
formation
may
,
therefore
,
be
an
important
determinant
of
CB
3717
cytotoxicity
.

In
early
clinical
studies
with
CB
3717
,
activity
has
been
seen
in
breast
cancer
,
ovarian
cancer
,
hepatoma
,
and
mesothelioma
.

Toxicities
included

hepatotoxicity
,
malaise
,
and
dose
-
limiting
nephrotoxicity
.

This
latter
effect
is
thought
to
be
due
to
drug
precipitation
within
the
renal
tubule
as
a
result
of
the
poor
solubility
of
CB
3717
under
acidic
conditions
.

In
an
attempt
to
overcome
this
problem
,
a
clinical
trial
of
CB
3717
administered
with
alkaline
diuresis
is
under
way
.

Preliminary
results
at
400
and
500
mg
/
m2
suggest
that
a
reduction
in
nephrotoxicity
may
have
been
achieved
with
only
1
instance
of
renal
toxicity
in
10
patients
.

Hepatotoxicity
and
malaise
are
again
the
most
frequent
side
effects
.

Evidence
of
antitumor
activity
has
been
seen
in
3
patients
.

Pharmacokinetic
investigations
have
shown
that
alkaline
diuresis
does
not
alter
CB
3717
plasma
levels
or
urinary
excretion
and
that
satisfactory
urinary
alkalinization
can
be
readily
achieved
.

Ethopropazine
and
benztropine
in
neuroleptic
-
induced
parkinsonism
.

In
a
12-week
controlled
study
ethopropazine
was
compared
to
benztropine
in
the
treatment
of
parkinsonism
induced
by
fluphenazine
enanthate
in
60

schizophrenic
outpatients
.

Ethopropazine
and
benztropine
were
found
to
be
equally
effective
in
controlling
parkinsonian
symptoms
and
were
as
efficacious
as
procyclidine
,
their
previous
antiparkinsonian
drug
.

However
,
benztropine
treated
patients
had
a
significant
increase
in
tardive
dyskinesia
compared
to
their
condition
during
procyclindine
treatment
,
and
significantly
more

anxiety
and
depression
than
ethopropazine
treated
patients
.

This
suggests
that
benztropine
is
not
the
anticholinergic
drug
of
choice
in
the
treatment
of
neuroleptic
-
induced
parkinsonian
symptoms
,
because
of
its
more
toxic
central
and
peripheral
atropinic
effect
.

Effect
of
alpha
-
tocopherol
and
deferoxamine
on
methamphetamine
-induced
neurotoxicity
.

Methamphetamine
(
MA
)
-induced

dopaminergic
neurotoxicity
is
believed
to
be
associated
with
the
increased
formation
of
free
radicals
.

This
study
examined
the
effect
of
alpha
-
tocopherol

(
alpha
-
TC
)
,
a
scavenger
of
reactive
oxygen
species
,
and
deferoxamine

(
DFO
)
,
an
iron
chelator
,
on
the
MA
-induced
neurotoxicity
.

Male
rats
were
treated
with
MA

(
10
mg
/
kg
,
every
2
h
for
four
injections
)
.

The
rat
received
either
alpha
-
TC

(
20
mg
/
kg
)

intraperitoneally
for
3
days
and
30
min
prior
to
MA
administration
or
DFO

(
50
mg
/
kg
)
subcutaneously
30
min
before
MA
administration
.

The
concentrations
of
dopamine

(
DA
)
,

serotonin
and
their
metabolites
decreased
significantly
after
MA
administration
,
which
was
inhibited
by
the
alpha
-
TC
and
DFO
pretreatment
.

alpha
-
TC
and
DFO
attenuated
the
MA
-induced

hyperthermia
as
well
as
the
alterations
in
the
locomotor
activity
.

The
level
of
lipid
peroxidation
was
higher
and
the
reduced
glutathione
concentration
was
lower
in
the
MA
-treated
rats
.

These
changes
were
significantly
attenuated
by
alpha
-
TC
and
DFO
.

This
suggests
that
alpha
-
TC
and
DFO
ameliorate
the
MA
-induced
neuronal
damage
by
decreasing
the
level
of
oxidative
stress
.

Use
of
dexamethasone
with
mesna
for
the
prevention
of
ifosfamide

-induced
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

AIM
:
Hemorrhagic
cystitis
(
HC
)
is
a
limiting
side
-
effect
of
chemotherapy
with
ifosfamide

(
IFS
)
.

In
the
study
presented
here
,
we
investigated
the
use
of
dexamethasone
in
combination
with
mesna
for
the
prevention
of
IFS
-induced
HC
.

METHODS
:

Male
Wistar
rats
(
150
-
200
g
;
6
rats
per
group
)
were
treated
with
saline
or
mesna
5
min
(
i.p
.
)

before
and
2
and
6
h
after
(
v.o
.
)

administration
of
IFS
.

One
,
two
or
three
doses
of

mesna
were
replaced
with
dexamethasone
alone
or
with
dexamethasone
plus
mesna
.

Cystitis
was
evaluated
24
h
after
its
induction
by
the
changes
in
bladder
wet
weight
and
by
macroscopic
and
microscopic
analysis
.

RESULTS
:

The
replacement
of
the
last
dose
or
the
last
two
doses
of
mesna
with

dexamethasone
reduced
the
increase
in
bladder
wet
weight
induced
by
IFS
by
84.79
%
and
89.13
%
,
respectively
.

In
addition
,
it
almost
abolished
the
macroscopic
and
microscopic
alterations
induced
by
IFS
.

Moreover
,
the
addition
of
dexamethasone
to
the
last
two
doses
of
mesna
was
more
efficient
than
three
doses
of
mesna
alone
when
evaluated
microscopically
.

CONCLUSION
:

Dexamethasone
in
combination
with
mesna
was
efficient
in
blocking
IFS
-induced

HC
.

However
,
the
replacement
of
last
two
doses
of
mesna
with
saline
or
all
of
the
mesna
doses
with
dexamethasone
did
not
prevent
HC
.

Behavioral
effects
of
MK-801
on
reserpine
-treated
mice
.

The
effects
of
dizocilpine

(
MK-801
)
,
a
noncompetitive
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptor
antagonist
,
were
studied
on
dopamine
-related
behaviors
induced
by
reserpine
treatments
.

This
study
focuses
on
behavioral
syndromes
that
may
used
as
models
for
Parkinson
's
disease
,
or
tardive
dyskinesia
,
and
its
response
after
glutamatergic
blockage
.

Reserpine
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
administered
once
every
other
day
for
4
days
,
produced
increases
in
orofacial
dyskinesia
,
tongue
protrusion
and
vacuous
chewing
in
mice
,
which
are
signs
indicative
of
tardive
dyskinesia
.

Reserpine
also
produced

tremor
and
catalepsy
,
which
are
signs
suggestive
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

MK-801
(
0.1
mg
/
kg
)
,
administered
30
min
before
the
observation
test
,
prevented
the
vacuous
chewing
movements
,
tongue
protrusions
and
catalepsy
induced
by
reserpine
.

However
,
MK-801
injection
produced
a
significant
increase
of
tremor
in
reserpine
-treated
mice
.

Reserpine
(
1
mg
/
kg
)
,
administered
90
min
before
the
test
and
followed
by
apomophine
injection
(
0.1
mg
/
kg
)
5
min
before
the
test
,
did
not
produce
oral
dyskinesia
in
mice
.

On
the
other
hand
,
reserpine
induced
increases
in
tremor
and
catalepsy
compared
to
control
mice
.

MK-801
(
0.1
mg
/
kg
)
administration
attenuated
the
catalepsy
and
tremor
induced
by
reserpine
.

Pretreatment
with
reserpine

(
1
mg
/
kg
)

24
h
before
the
observation
test
produced
increases
in
vacuous
chewing
movements
and
tongue
protrusion
,
as
well
as
increases
in
tremor
and
catalepsy
,
whereas
MK-801

(
0.1
mg
/
kg
)
injection
90
min
before
the
test
reversed
the
effects
of
reserpine
.

These
results
show
that
reserpine
produces
different
and
abnormal
movements
,
which
are
related
to
dose
and
schedule
employed
and
can
be
considered
as
parkinsonian
-like
and
tardive
dsykinesia
signs
.

The
glutamatergic
blockage
produced
by
NMDA
can
restore
these
signs
,
such
as
vacuous
chewing
movements
,
tongue
protrusions
,
catalepsy
and
tremor
according
to
the
employed
model
.

Effect
of
glyceryl
trinitrate
on
the
sphincter
of
Oddi
spasm
evoked
by
prostigmine
-
morphine
administration
.

OBJECTIVE
:

In
this
study
the
effect
of
glyceryl
trinitrate
on
the
prostigmine
-
morphine
-induced
sphincter
of
Oddi
spasm
was
evaluated
in
nine
female
patients
with
sphincter
of
Oddi
dyskinesia
.

METHOD
:

Sphincter
of
Oddi
spasm
was
induced
by
prostigmine
-
morphine
administration
(
0.5
mg
prostigmine
intramuscularly
and

10
mg

morphine
subcutaneously
)
and
visualized
by
quantitative
hepatobiliary
scintigraphy
.

The
entire
procedure
was
repeated
during
glyceryl
trinitrate
infusion

(
Nitrolingual
1
microg
/
kg
/
min
for
120
min
)
.

RESULTS
:

Prostigmine
-
morphine
provocation
caused
significant
increases
in
the
time
to
peak
activity
(
Tmax
)
over
the
hepatic
hilum
(
HH
:
34.33

5.05
vs.
22.77

)
and
the
common
bile
duct
(
CBD
:
60.44

)
and
in
the
half

)
over
the
liver
parenchyma
(

)
,
HH
(

)
and
CBD
(
158.11
+
/-

9.18
vs.
40.1
+
/-

6.24
)
,

indicating
a
complete
spasm
at
the
level
of
the
sphincter
of
Oddi
.

Glyceryl
trinitrate
infusion
completely
normalized
the
prostigmine
-
morphine
-induced
alterations
in
these
quantitative
parameters
(
TmaX
over
the
LP
:
11.33
+
/-

;
over
the
HH
:

3.10
;
and
over
the

+
/-
6.33
)
,
suggesting
an
effective
sphincter
-
relaxing
effect
of
glyceryl
trinitrate
.

CONCLUSION
:

These
results
provide
the
first
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of
glyceryl
trinitrate
on
the
morphine
-induced
sphincter
of
Oddi
spasm
in
humans
.

Since
glyceryl
trinitrate
is
able
to
overcome
even
the
drastic
effect
of
morphine
,
it
might
be
of
relevance
in
the
treatment
of
sphincter
of
Oddi
dyskinesia
.

Effects
of
acute
steroid
administration
on
ventilatory
and
peripheral
muscles
in
rats
.

Occasional
case
reports
have
shown
that
acute
myopathy
may
occur
in
patients
treated
with
massive
doses
of
corticosteroids
.

The
mechanism
of
this
myopathy
is
poorly
understood
.

Therefore
,
60
male
rats
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
daily
injection
of
saline
(
C
)
,
methylprednisolone

(
M
)
,
or
triamcinolone
(
T
)
80
mg
/
kg
/

d
for
5
d.
Nutritional
intake
,
measured
daily
in
15
animals
,
showed
a
significant
reduction
of
food
intake
in
the
steroid
-treated
groups
(
-50
and
-79
%
in
M
and
T
,
respectively
)
.

This
was
associated
with
a
similar
loss
in
body
weight
.

In
the
45
remaining
animals
,
diaphragm
contractility
and
histopathologic
features
of
several
muscles
were
studied
.

Weights
of
respiratory
and
peripheral
muscles
were
similarly
decreased
after
steroid
treatment
.

Maximal
twitches
of
the
diaphragm
were
lower
in
the
C
group
(
653
+
/-

174
g
/
cm(2
)
)
than
in
the
M
group
(
837
+
/-
171
g
/
cm(2
)
;
p
0.05
)
and
the
T
group
(
765
+
/-

145
g
/
cm(2
)
,
NS
)
.

Half
-
relaxation
time
was
prolonged
in
both
steroid
groups
,
and
time
to
peak
tension
was
longer
with
M
,
whereas
tetanic
tensions
were
similar
.

Steroid
treatment
also
induced
a
leftward
shift
of
the
force
-
frequency
curve
at
25
and
50
Hz
when
compared
with
saline
treatment
(
p
0.05
)
.

ATPase
staining
of
the
diaphragm
,
scalenus
medius
,
and
gastrocnemius
showed
type
IIb
fiber

atrophy
in
the
steroid
groups
and
also
diaphragmatic
type
IIa

atrophy
with
T
,
whereas
histologic
examinations
revealed
a
normal
muscular
pattern
with
absence
of
necrosis
.

Finally
,
a
pair
-
fed
(
PF
)
study
,
performed
in
18
rats
(
C
,
T
,
and
PF
)
,
showed
that
muscle
atrophy
was
considerably
less
pronounced
in
PF
animals
than
in
T
-treated
animals
.

We
conclude
that
(
1
)
short
-
term
treatment
with
massive
doses
of
steroids
induced
severe
respiratory
and
limb
muscle
wasting
;

(
2
)
both
types
of
steroids
induced
predominantly
type
IIb
atrophy
,
resulting
in
the
expected
alterations
in
diaphragm
contractile
properties
;
(
3
)
neither
steroid
caused
muscle

necrosis
;
(
4
)
type
IIb

atrophy
was
not
caused
by
acute
nutritional
deprivation
alone
.

Refractory
cardiogenic
shock
and
complete
heart
block
after
verapamil
SR
and
metoprolol
treatment
.

A
case
report
.

A
seventy
-
eight
-
year
-
old
woman
presented
with
complete
heart
block
and
refractory
hypotension
two
days
after
a
therapeutic
dose
of
sustained
-
release
verapamil
with
concomitant
use
of
metoprolol
.

The
patient
continued
to
remain
hypotensive
with
complete
heart
block
,
even
with
multiple
uses
of
intravenous
atropine
as
well
as
high
doses
of
pressor
agents
such
as
dopamine
and
dobutamine
.

However
,
shortly
after
the
use
of
intravenous
calcium
chloride
,
the
refractory
hypotension
and
complete
heart
block
resolved
.

A
phase
I
clinical
study
of
the
antipurine
antifolate
lometrexol

(
DDATHF
)
given
with
oral
folic
acid
.

Lometrexol
is
an
antifolate
which
inhibits
glycinamide
ribonucleotide
formyltransferase
(
GARFT
)
,
an
enzyme
essential
for
de
novo
purine
synthesis
.

Extensive
experimental
and
limited
clinical
data
have
shown
that
lometrexol
has
activity
against
tumours
which
are
refractory
to
other
drugs
,
notably
methotrexate
.

However
,
the
initial
clinical
development
of
lometrexol
was
curtailed
because
of
severe
and
cumulative
antiproliferative
toxicities
.

Preclinical
murine
studies
demonstrated
that
the
toxicity
of
lometrexol
can
be
prevented
by
low
dose
folic
acid
administration
,
i.e.
for
7
days
prior
to
and
7
days
following
a
single
bolus
dose
.

This
observation
prompted
a
Phase
I
clinical
study
of
lometrexol
given
with
folic
acid
supplementation
which
has
confirmed
that
the
toxicity
of
lometrexol
can
be
markedly
reduced
by
folic
acid
supplementation
.

Thrombocytopenia
and
mucositis
were
the
major
toxicities
.

There
was
no
clear
relationship
between
clinical
toxicity
and
the
extent
of
plasma
folate
elevation
.

Associated
studies
demonstrated
that
lometrexol
plasma
pharmacokinetics
were
not
altered
by
folic
acid
administration
indicating
that
supplementation
is
unlikely
to
reduce
toxicity
by
enhancing
lometrexol
plasma
clearance
.

The
work
described
in
this
report
has
identified
for
the
first
time
a
clinically
acceptable
schedule
for
the
administration
of
a
GARFT
inhibitor
.

This
information
will
facilitate
the
future
evaluation
of
this
class
of
compounds
in
cancer
therapy
.

,
however
,
produced

.

The
analgesic
effect
of
the
mu
-

morphine
was
dose

dependently
antagonized
by
naloxone
and
prevented
by
co

toxin
.

Morphine
did
not
,
however
,
alter
the
hyperalgesia
induced
by
8-bromo

adenosine
monophosphate
.

We
conclude
that
the
analgesic
action
of
opioids
on
the
peripheral
terminals
of
primary
afferents
is
via
a
binding
site
with
characteristics
of
the
mu

receptor
and
that
this
action
is
mediated
by
inhibition
of
the
cyclic

Adequate
timing
of
ribavirin
reduction
in
patients
with
hemolysis
during
combination
therapy
of
interferon
and
ribavirin
for
chronic
hepatitis
C
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hemolytic
anemia
is
one
of
the
major
adverse
events
of
the
combination
therapy
of
interferon
and
ribavirin
.

Because
of
ribavirin
-related
hemolytic
anemia
,
dose
reduction
is
a
common
event
in
this
therapy
.

In
this
clinical
retrospective
cohort
study
we
have
examined
the
suitable
timing
of
ribavirin
reduction
in
patients
with
hemolysis
during
combination
therapy
.

METHODS
:

Thirty
-
seven
of
160
patients
who
had
HCV
-
genotype
1b
,
had
high
virus
load
,
and
received
24-week
combination
therapy
developed
anemia
with
hemoglobin
level
10
g
/
dl
or
anemia
-related
signs
during
therapy
.

After
that
,
these
37
patients
were
reduced
one
tablet
of
ribavirin

(
200
mg
)
per
day
.

After
reduction
of
ribavirin
,
27
of
37
patients
could
continue
combination
therapy
for
a
total
of
24
weeks
(
group
A
)
.

However
,
10
of
37
patients
with
reduction
of
ribavirin
could
not
continue
combination
therapy
because
their
8.5
g
/
dl
hemoglobin
values
decreased
to
or
anemia
-related
severe
side
effects
occurred
(
group
B
)
.

We
assessed
the
final
efficacy
and
safety
after
reduction
of
ribavirin
in
groups
A
and
B.
RESULTS
:

A
sustained
virological
response
(
SVR
)
was
29.6
%
(
8/27
)
in
group
A
and
10
%
(
1/10
)
in
group
B
,
respectively
.

A
34.4
%
(
12/27
)
of
SVR
+
biological
response
in
group
A
was
higher
than
10
%
(
1/10
)
in
group
B
(
P
=
0.051
)
,
with
slight
significance
.

With
respect
to
hemoglobin
level
at
the
time
of
ribavirin
reduction
,
a
rate
of
continuation
of
therapy
in
patients
with
>
or
=
10
g
/
dl
hemoglobin
was
higher
than
that
in
patients
with
10
g
/
dl
(
P
=
0.036
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Reduction
of
ribavirin
at
hemoglobin
level
>
or
=
10
g
/
dl
is
suitable
in
terms
of
efficacy
and
side
effects
.

Increased
expression
and
apical
targeting
of
renal
ENaC
subunits
in
puromycin
aminonucleoside

-induced

nephrotic
syndrome
in
rats
.

Nephrotic
syndrome
is
often
accompanied
by
sodium
retention
and
generalized
edema
.

However
,
the
molecular
basis
for
the
decreased
renal
sodium
excretion
remains
undefined
.

We
hypothesized
that
epithelial
Na
channel
(
ENaC
)
subunit
dysregulation
may
be
responsible
for
the
increased
sodium
retention
.

An
experimental
group
of
rats
was
treated
with
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
;
180
mg
/
kg
iv
)
,
whereas
the
control
group
received
only
vehicle
.

After
7
days
,
PAN
treatment
induced
significant
proteinuria
,
hypoalbuminemia
,
decreased
urinary
sodium
excretion
,
and
extensive
ascites
.

The
protein
abundance
of
alpha
-
ENaC
and
beta
-
ENaC
was
increased
in
the
inner
stripe
of
the
outer
medulla
(
ISOM
)
and
in
the
inner
medulla
(
IM
)
but
was
not
altered
in
the
cortex
.

gamma
-
ENaC
abundance
was
increased
in
the
cortex
,
ISOM
,
and
IM
.

Immunoperoxidase
brightfield-
and
laser
-
scanning
confocal
fluorescence
microscopy
demonstrated
increased
targeting
of
alpha
-
ENaC
,
beta
-
ENaC
,
and
gamma
-
ENaC
subunits
to
the
apical
plasma
membrane
in
the
distal
convoluted
tubule
(
DCT2
)
,
connecting
tubule
,
and
cortical
and
medullary
collecting
duct
segments
.

Immunoelectron
microscopy
further
revealed
an
increased
labeling
of
alpha
-
ENaC
in
the
apical
plasma
membrane
of
cortical
collecting
duct
principal
cells
of
PAN

-treated
rats
,
indicating
enhanced
apical
targeting
of
alpha
-
ENaC
subunits
.

In
contrast
,
the
protein
abundances
of
Na
(

)
/
H

,
and
thiazide
-sensitive
Na
(

)
-
Cl
(

cotransporter
(
TSC
)
were
decreased
.

Moreover
,
the
abundance
of
the
alpha(1)-subunit
of
the
Na
-
K
-ATPase
was
decreased
in
the
cortex
and
ISOM
,
but
it
remained
unchanged
in
the
IM
.

In
conclusion
,
the
increased
or
sustained
expression
of
ENaC
subunits
combined
with
increased
apical
targeting
in
the
DCT2
,
connecting
tubule
,
and
collecting
duct
are
likely
to
play
a
role
in
the
sodium

associated
with
PAN
-induced
nephrotic
syndrome
.

The
decreased
abundance
of
NHE3
,
BSC-1

-ATPase
may
play
a
compensatory
role

Does
hormone
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
memory
and
cognition
?

A
pilot
study
.

This
pilot
study
examines
whether
hormone
therapy
for
breast
cancer

affects
cognition
.

Patients
participating
in
a
randomised
trial
of
anastrozole
,
tamoxifen
alone
or
combined
(
ATAC
)

(
n=94
)
and
a
group
of
women
without
breast
cancer

(
n=35
)
completed
a
battery
of
neuropsychological
measures
.

Compared
with
the
control
group
,
the
patients
were
impaired
on
a
processing
speed
task
(
p=0.032
)
and
on
a
measure
of
immediate
verbal
memory
(
p=0.026
)
after
controlling
for
the
use
of
hormone
replacement
therapy
in
both
groups
.

Patient
group
performance
was
not
significantly
related
to
length
of
treatment
or
measures
of
psychological
morbidity
.

The
results
showed
specific
impairments
in
processing
speed
and
verbal
memory
in
women
receiving
hormonal
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
.

Verbal
memory
may
be
especially
sensitive
to
changes
in
oestrogen
levels
,
a
finding
commonly
reported
in
studies
of
hormone
replacement
therapy
in
healthy
women
.

In
view
of
the
increased
use
of
hormone
therapies
in
an
adjuvant
and
preventative
setting
their
impact
on
cognitive
functioning
should
be
investigated
more
thoroughly
.

Association
of
nitric
oxide
production
and
apoptosis
in
a
model
of
experimental
nephropathy
.

BACKGROUND
:

In
recent
studies
increased
amounts
of
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
and
apoptosis
have
been
implicated
in
various
pathological
conditions
in
the
kidney
.

We
have
studied
the
role
of
NO
and
its
association
with
apoptosis
in
an
experimental
model
of
nephrotic
syndrome
induced
by
a
single
injection
of
adriamycin

(
ADR
)
.

METHODS
:

The
alteration
in
the
NO
pathway
was
assessed
by
measuring
nitrite
levels
in
serum
/
urine
and
by
evaluating
the
changes
in
vascular
reactivity
of
the
isolated
perfused
rat
kidney
(
IPRK
)
system
.

Rats
were
stratified
into
control
groups
and
ADR
-induced
nephropathy
groups
.

These
two
groups
were
then
divided
into
:
group
1
,
animals
receiving
saline
;
and
group
2
,
animals
receiving
aminoguanidine

(
AG
)
which
is
a
specific
inhibitor
of
inducible-
NO
synthase
.

On
day
21
,
rats
were
sacrificed
after
obtaining
material
for
biochemical
analysis
.

RESULTS
:

Histopathological
examination
of
the
kidneys
of
rats
treated
with

ADR
revealed
focal
areas
of
mesangial
proliferation
and
mild
tubulointerstitial
inflammation
.

They
also
had
significantly
higher
levels
of
proteinuria
compared
with
control
and
treatment
groups
(
P
0.05
)
.

Urine
nitrite
levels
were
significantly
increased
in
the
ADR
-
nephropathy
group
(
P
0.05
)
.

In
the
IPRK
phenylephrine
and
acetylcholine
related
responses
were
significantly
impaired
in
the
ADR
-
nephropathy
group
.

Apoptosis
was
not
detected
in
controls
.

However
,
in
the
ADR
-
nephropathy
group
,
numerous
apoptotic
cells
were
identified
in
the
tubulointerstitial
areas
.

Double
staining
revealed
numerous
interstitial
apoptotic
cells
to
stain
for
ED1
,
a
marker
for
monocytes
/
macrophages
.

Treatment
with
AG
prevented
the
impairment
of
renal
vascular
bed
responses
and
reduced
both
urine
nitrite
levels
and
apoptosis
to
control
levels
.

CONCLUSION
:

We
suggest
that
interactions
between
NO
and
apoptosis
are
important
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
ADR

-induced

nephrosis
.

The
attenuating
effect
of
carteolol
hydrochloride
,
a
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
,
on
neuroleptic
-
induced
catalepsy
in
rats
.

It
is
known
that
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonists
are
effective
in
the
treatment
of
akathisia
,
one
of
the
extrapyramidal
side
effects
that
occur
during
neuroleptic
treatment
.

Neuroleptic
-
induced
catalepsy
,
a
model
of
neuroleptic
-
induced
extrapyramidal
side
effects
,
was
considered
suitable
as
a
model
for
predicting
neuroleptic
-
induced
akathisia
in
humans
,
although
neuroleptic
-
induced
catalepsy
was
not
considered
a
specific
test
for
neuroleptic
-
induced
akathisia
.

Therefore
,
the
effects
of
carteolol
,
a
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonist
,
on
haloperidol
-induced
catalepsy
in
rats
were
behaviorally
studied
and
compared
with
those
of
propranolol
and
biperiden
,
a
muscarinic
receptor
antagonist
.

Carteolol
,
as
well
as
propranolol
and
biperiden
,
inhibited
the
haloperidol
-induced
catalepsy
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
carteolol
was
almost
comparable
to
that
of
propranolol
,
but
was
weaker
than
that
of
biperiden
.

Carteolol
did
not
evoke
postsynaptic
dopamine

receptor
-
stimulating
behavioral
signs
such
as
stereotypy
and
hyperlocomotion
in
rats
.

Carteolol
did
not
antagonize
the
inhibitory
effects
of
haloperidol
on
apomorphine
-induced
stereotypy
and
locomotor
activity
in
rats
.

In
addition
,
carteolol
did
not
evoke
5-HT1A
receptor
-
stimulating
behavioral
signs
such
as
flat
body
posture
and
forepaw
treading
and
did
not
inhibit

5-hydroxytryptophan
-induced

head
twitch
in
rats
.

Finally
,
carteolol
did
not
inhibit
physostigmine
-induced
lethality
in
rats
.

These
results
strongly
suggest
that
carteolol
improves
haloperidol
-induced
catalepsy
via
its
beta
-
adrenoceptor
antagonistic
activity
and
is
expected
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
akathisia
without
attenuating
neuroleptic
-
induced
antipsychotic
effects
due
to
its
postsynaptic
dopamine
receptor
antagonistic
activity
.

Penicillamine
-induced
rapidly
progressive
glomerulonephritis
in
a
patient
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

A
67-year
-
old
woman
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
presented
rapidly
progressive
glomerulonephritis

(
RPGN
)
after
5
months
of
D
-
penicillamine

(
250
mg
/
day
)
treatment
.

Light
microscopy
study
showed
severe
glomerulonephritis
with
crescent
formation
in
60
%
of
the
glomeruli
and
infiltration
of
inflammatory
cells
in
the
wall
of
an
arteriole
.

Immunofluorescence
revealed
scanty
granular
IgG
,
IgA
and
C3
deposits
along
the
capillary
walls
and
mesangium
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
steroid
pulse
,
plasmapheresis
,
cyclophosphamide
and
antiplatelet
agents
.

A
complete
recovery
of
renal
function
was
achieved
in
a
few
weeks
.

This
new
case
of
RPGN
in
the
course
of
D
-
penicillamine
treatment
emphasizes
the
need
for
frequent
monitoring
of
renal
function
and
evaluation
of
urinary
sediment
and
proteinuria
in
these
patients
.

The
prompt
discontinuation
of
D
-
penicillamine
and
vigorous
treatment
measures
could
allow
for
a
good
prognosis
as
in
this
case
.

,
we
undertook

Following
a
3-week
observation
period
,
volunteers
were
treated
with
zidovudine

600
mg
/
day
for
18
weeks
,
900
mg
/

for
9
weeks
and
1200

for
9

,
followed
by
a
washout
period
of
6
weeks

after
which
they
were
re
-
started
on
1200
mg

or
the
highest

at
8-hourly
intervals
.

Subjects
were
randomly
assigned
to
4-hourly

8-hourly
regimens
within
CDC
groups
while
taking
600
and
1200
mg
/
day
.

Clinical
and
laboratory
evaluations
were
performed
at
3-week
intervals
.

Symptomatic
adverse

were
present
in
96
%
of

,
most
commonly
nausea
(
64
%
)
,
fatigue
(
55
%
)
and
headache
(
49
%
)
.

These
were
generally
self

limited
,
reappearing
briefly
at
each
dose
increment
.

A
decrease
in
hemoglobin
occurred
shortly
after
initiation
of
therapy
.

This
was
not

and
reversed
rapidly
upon

:
summary
report
of
a

study
.

During
a
ten
-
year
period
,
348
women
were
studied
for
a
total
of
5,877
patient
months
in
four
separate
studies
relating
oral
contraceptives
to
changes
in
hematologic
parameters
.

Significant
increases
in
certain
factors
of
the
blood
coagulation
and
fibrinolysin
systems
(
factors
I
,
II
,
VII
,
VIII
,
IX
,
and
X
and
plasminogen
)
were
observed
in
the
treated
groups
.

Severe
complications
developed
in
four
patients
.

All
four
had
an
abnormal
blood
coagulation
profile
,
suggesting
"
hypercoagulability
"
before
initiation
of
therapy
.

Some
of
these
findings
represented
the
most
extreme

seen
in
the
entire
group
of
patients
;
some
increased
further
during
therapy
.

One
of
these
patients
developed
a
myocardial
infarction
before
receiving
any
medication
,
shortly
after
the
base
-
line
values
were
obtained
.

One
patient
developed
retinopathy

19
months
after
she
began
therapy
,
and
another
developed

thrombophlebitis
after
27
months
of
therapy
.

The
fourth
patient
developed
thrombophlebitis

14
days
after
initiation
of
contraceptive
therapy
.

All
four
patients
were
of
the
A
or
AB
blood
group
.

Previous
studies
suggested
the
possiblility
of
increased
propensity
for
thromboembolic
episodes
in
patients
possessing
the
A
antigen
.

It
appears
from
these
data
that
hematologic
work
-
ups
may
be
useful
in
women
who
are
about
to
start
long
-
term
oral
contraceptive
therapy
.

Cardiac
arrest
in
a
child
with
cerebral
palsy
undergoing
sevoflurane
induction
of
anesthesia
after
preoperative
clonidine
.

Clonidine
is
a
frequently
administered
alpha2-adrenergic
agonist
which
can
decrease
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
.

We
present
a
case
of
a
5-year
-
old
child
with
cerebral
palsy
and
seizure
disorder
,
receiving
clonidine
for
restlessness
,
who
presented
for
placement
of
a
baclofen
pump
.

Without
the
knowledge
of
the
medical
personnel
,
the
patient
's
mother
administered
three
doses
of
clonidine
during
the
evening
before
and
morning
of
surgery
to
reduce
anxiety
.

During
induction
of
anesthesia
,
the
patient
developed
bradycardia
and
hypotension
requiring
cardiac
resuscitation
.

There
are
no
previous
reports
of
clonidine

-associated

cardiac
arrest
in
a
child
undergoing
induction
of
anesthesia
.

Effects
of
UMB24
and

(
+
/-)-
SM
21
,
putative
sigma2-preferring
antagonists
,
on
behavioral
toxic
and
stimulant
effects
of
cocaine
in
mice
.

Earlier
studies
have
demonstrated
that
antagonism
of
sigma1
receptors
attenuates
the
convulsive
,
lethal
,
locomotor
stimulatory
and
rewarding
actions
of
cocaine
in
mice
.

In
contrast
,
the
contribution
of
sigma2
receptors
is
unclear
because
experimental
tools
to
selectively
target
this
subtype
are
unavailable
.

To
begin
addressing
this
need
,
we
characterized
UMB24

(
1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine
)
and

(
+
/-)-

SM
21

(
3alpha
-
tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate
)
in
receptor
binding
and
behavioral
studies
.

Receptor
binding
studies
confirmed
that
UMB24
and

(
+
/-)-
SM
21
display
preferential
affinity
for
sigma2
over
sigma1
receptors
.

In
behavioral
studies
,
pretreatment
of
Swiss
Webster
mice
with
UMB24
or

(
+

/-)-
SM
21
significantly
attenuated
cocaine
-induced
convulsions
and
locomotor
activity
,
but
not
lethality
.

When
administered
alone
,
(
+
/-)-

SM
21
produced
no
significant
effects
compared
to
control
injections
of
saline
,
but
UMB24
had
locomotor
depressant
actions
.

Together
,
the
data
suggest
that
sigma2
receptor
antagonists
have
the
potential
to
attenuate
some
of
the
behavioral
effects
of
cocaine
,
and
further
development
of
more
selective
,
high
affinity
ligands
are
warranted
.

Methimazole
-induced
cholestatic
jaundice
.

Methimazole
is
a
widely
used
and
generally
well
-
tolerated
antithyroid
agent
.

A
43-year
-
old
woman
had
severe
jaundice
and
itching
1
month
after
receiving
methimazole

(
10
mg
tid
)
and
propranolol
(
20
mg
tid
)
for
treatment
of
hyperthyroidism
.

The
patient
continued
treatment
for
another
4
days
after
the
appearance
of
jaundice
until
she
finished
both
medications
.

When
seen
at
the
emergency
department
2
weeks
later
,
she
still
had
severe
icterus
,
pruritus
,
and
hyperbilirubinemia
,
formed
mainly
of
the
conjugated
fraction
.

Methimazole
-induced

cholestasis
was
diagnosed
,
and
propranolol
therapy
was
resumed
.

Over
the
following
9
days
,
the
symptoms
improved
and
plasma
bilirubin
levels
were
normal
after
12
weeks
without
methimazole
.

In
rare
cases
within
the
first
few
weeks
of
therapy
,
this
drug
can
cause
severe
and
reversible
cholestatic
jaundice
.

Physicians
and
patients
should
be
aware
of
this
adverse
effect
so
that
,
upon
occurrence
,
they
can
discontinue
methimazole
therapy
and
avoid
unnecessary
invasive
procedures
.

Ciprofloxacin
-induced
acute
interstitial
nephritis
and
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
.

Ciprofloxacin
has
been
associated
with
several
side
effects
including
interstitial
nephritis
and
hemolytic
anemia
.

The
combination
of
both
side
effects
is
extremely
rare
.

In
this
report
,
we
describe
a
case
of
ciprofloxacin
-induced
interstitial
nephritis
and
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
.

Hemolytic
anemia
improved
after
stopping
the
drug
and
initiation
of
steroid
therapy
.

Unfortunately
,
acute
interstitial
nephritis
was
irreversible
and
the
patient
developed
end
-
stage
renal
disease
.

Contribution
of
sodium
valproate
to
the
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
62-year
-
old
man
who
was
administered
sodium
valproate

(
VPA
)
and
who
subsequently
developed
the
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone

(
SIADH
)
.

He
had
been
taking
VPA
for
treatment
of
idiopathic
generalized

tonic
-
clonic
convulsions
since
he
was
56
years
old
.

After
substituting
VPA
with
zonisamide
,
the
serum
sodium
level
returned
to
normal
.

We
consider
this
episode
of
SIADH
to
be
the
result
of
a
combination
of
factors
including
a
weakness
of
the
central
nervous
system
and
the
long
-
term
administration
of
VPA
.

Vasopressin
in
the
treatment
of
milrinone
-induced
hypotension
in
severe
heart
failure
.

The
use
of
phosphodiesterase
inhibitors
such
as
milrinone
in
the
treatment
of
severe
heart
failure
is
frequently
restricted
because
they
cause
vasodilation
and
hypotension
.

In
patients
with
decompensated
heart
failure
with
hypotension
after
treatment
with
milrinone
,
low
doses
of

vasopressin
restored
blood
pressure
without
inhibiting
the
inotropic
effect
of
milrinone
.

Halogenated
anesthetics
form
liver
adducts
and
antigens
that
cross
-
react
with
halothane
-induced
antibodies
.

Two
halogenated
anesthetics
,
enflurane
and
isoflurane
,
have
been
associated
with
an
allergic
-
type
hepatic
injury
both
alone
and
following
previous
exposure
to
halothane
.

Halothane

hepatitis
appears
to
involve
an
aberrant
immune
response
.

An
antibody
response
to
a
protein
-
bound
biotransformation
product
(
trifluoroacetyl
adduct
)
has
been
detected
on
halothane
hepatitis
patients
.

This
study
was
performed
to
determine
cross
-
reactivity
between
enflurane
and
isoflurane
with
the
hypersensitivity
induced
by
halothane
.

The
subcellular
and
lobular
production
of
hepatic
neoantigens
recognized
by
halothane
-induced
antibodies
following
enflurane
and
isoflurane
,
and
the
biochemical
nature
of
these
neoantigens
was
investigated
in
two
animal
models
.

Enflurane
administration
resulted
in
neoantigens
detected
in
both
the
microsomal
and
cytosolic
fraction
of
liver
homogenates
and
in
the
centrilobular
region
of
the
liver
.

In
the
same
liver
,
biochemical
analysis
detected
fluorinated
liver
adducts
that
were
up
to
20-fold
greater
in
guinea
pigs
than
in
rats
.

This
supports
and
extends
previous
evidence
for
a
mechanism
by
which
enflurane
and/or
isoflurane
could
produce
a
hypersensitivity
condition
similar
to
that
of
halothane

hepatitis
either
alone
or
subsequent
to
halothane
administration
.

The
guinea
pig
would
appear
to
be
a
useful
model
for
further
investigations
of
the
immunological
response
to
these
antigens
.

Induction
by
paracetamol
of
bladder
and
liver
tumours
in
the
rat
.

Effects
on
hepatocyte
fine
structure
.

Groups
of
male
and
female
inbred
Leeds
strain
rats
were
fed
diets
containing
either
0.5
%
or
1.0
%
paracetamol
by
weight
for
up
to
18
months
.

At
the
1.0
%
dosage
level
,
20
%
of
rats
of
both
sexes
developed
neoplastic
nodules
of
the
liver
,
a
statistically
significant
incidence
.

These
rats
also
showed
gross
enlargement
of
their
livers
and
an
increase
in
foci
of
cellular
alteration
,
the
latter
also
being
observed
in
the
low
dosage
male
rats
.

Papillomas
of
the
transitional
epithelium
of
the
bladder
developed
in
all
paracetamol
-treated
groups
,
and
three
rats
bore
bladder
carcinomas
.

However
,
significant
yields
of
bladder
tumours
were
only
obtained
from
low
dosage
females
and
high
dosage
males
.

Additionally
,
20
to
25
%
of
paracetamol
-treated
rats
developed
hyperplasia
of
the
bladder
epithelium
,
which
was
not
coincident
with
the
presence
of
bladder
calculi
.

A
low
yield
of
tumours
at
various
other
sites
also
arose
following
paracetamol
feeding
.

An
electron
microscope
study
of
the
livers
of

paracetamol
-treated
rats
revealed
ultrastructural
changes
in
the
hepatocytes
that
resemble
those
that
result
from
exposure
to
a
variety
of
known
hepatocarcinogens
.

Rat
extraocular
muscle
regeneration
.

Repair
of
local
anesthetic
-
induced
damage
.

Local
anesthetics
that
are
commonly
used
in
ophthalmic
surgery
(
0.75
%
bupivacaine
hydrochloride
,
2.0
%
mepivacaine
hydrochloride
,
and
2.0
%

lidocaine
hydrochloride
plus
1:100,000
epinephrine
)
were
injected
into
the
retrobulbar
area
of
rat
eyes
.

Controls
were
injected
with
physiological
saline
.

All
three
anesthetics
produced
massive
degeneration
of
the
extraocular
muscles
.

Muscle
degeneration
is
followed
by
regeneration
of
the
damaged
muscle
fibers
.

In
addition
to
muscle
damage
,
severe
damage
was
also
seen
in
harderian
glands
,
especially
after
exposure
to
mepivacaine
and
lidocaine
plus
epinephrine
.

With
these
findings
in
rats
,
it
is
hypothesized
that
the
temporary
diplopia
sometimes
seen
in
patients
after
ophthalmic
surgery
might
be
due
to
anesthetic
-
induced
damage
to
the
extraocular
muscles
.

Reversal
of
neuroleptic
-
induced
catalepsy
by
novel
aryl
-
piperazine
anxiolytic
drugs
.

The
novel
anxiolytic
drug
,
buspirone
,
reverses
catalepsy

induced
by
haloperidol
.

A
series
of
aryl
-
piperazine
analogues
of
buspirone
and
other
5-hydroxytryptaminergic
agonists
were
tested
for
their
ability
to
reverse
haloperidol
induced
catalepsy
.

Those
drugs
with
strong
affinity
for
5-hydroxytryptamine
1a
receptors
were
able
to
reverse
catalepsy
.

Drugs
with
affinity
for
other
5-HT
receptors
or
weak
affinity
were
ineffective
.

However
,
inhibition
of
postsynaptic
5-HT
receptors
neither
inhibited
nor
potentiated
reversal
of
catalepsy
and
leaves
open
the
question
as
to
the
site
or
mechanism
for
this
effect
.

Diazepam
facilitates
reflex
bradycardia
in
conscious
rats
.

The
effects
of
diazepam
on
cardiovascular
function
were
assessed
in
conscious
rats
.

Intravenous
administration
of
diazepam

(
1
-
30
mg
kg-1
)
produced
a
dose
-
dependent
decrease
in
both
the
mean
arterial
pressure
and
the
heart
rate
.

Also
,
reflex
bradycardia
was
produced
in
rats
by
intravenous
infusion
of
adrenaline
(
1.25
-
2.5
micrograms
kg-1
)
.

Intravenous
pretreatment
of
the
rats
with
diazepam
,
although
causing
no
change
in
the
adrenaline
-induced
pressor
effect
,
did
enhance
the
adrenaline
-induced
reflex
bradycardia
.

However
,
the
diazepam
enhancement
of
adrenaline
-induced
reflex
bradycardia
was
antagonized
by
pretreatment
of
rats
with
an
intravenous
dose
of
picrotoxin

(
an
agent
blocks
chloride
channels
by
binding
to
sites
associated
with
the
benzodiazepine
-
GABA
-
chloride
channel
macromolecular
complex
)
.

The
data
indicate
that
diazepam
acts
through
the
benzodiazepine
-
GABA
-
chloride
channel
macromolecular
complex
within
the
central
nervous
system
to
facilitate
reflex
bradycardia
mediated
through
baroreceptor
reflexes
in
response
to
an
acute
increase
in
arterial
pressure
.

Chronic
carbamazepine
inhibits
the
development
of
local
anesthetic
seizures
kindled
by
cocaine
and
lidocaine
.

The
effects
of
carbamazepine

(
CBZ
)
treatment
on
local
anesthetic
-
kindled

seizures
and
lethality
were
evaluated
in
different
stages
of
the
kindling
process
and
under
different
methods
of
CBZ
administration
.

Chronic
oral
CBZ
inhibited
the
development
of
both
lidocaine
-
and
cocaine
-induced
seizures
,
but
had
little
effect
on
the
fully
developed
local
anesthetic
seizures
.

Chronic
CBZ
also
decreased
the
incidence
of
seizure

-related
mortality
in
the
cocaine
-injected
rats
.

Acute
CBZ
over
a
range
of
doses
(
15
-
50
mg
/
kg
)
had
no
effect
on
completed
lidocaine
-kindled
or
acute
cocaine
-induced
seizures
.

Repeated
i.p
.
injection
of
CBZ

(
15
mg
/
kg
)
also
was
without
effect
on
the
development
of
lidocaine
-
or
cocaine

-kindled

seizures
.

The
differential
effects
of
CBZ
depending
upon
stage
of
seizure
development
suggest
that
distinct
mechanisms
underlie
the
development
versus
maintenance
of
local
anesthetic
-
kindled
seizures
.

The
effectiveness
of
chronic
but
not
repeated
,
intermittent
injections
of
CBZ
suggests
that
different
biochemical
consequences
result
from
the
different
treatment
regimens
.

The
possible
utility
of
chronic
CBZ
in
preventing
the
development
of
toxic
side
effects
in
human
cocaine
users
is
suggested
by
these
data
,
but
remains
to
be
directly
evaluated
.

D
-
penicillamine
in
the
treatment
of
localized
scleroderma
.

Localized
scleroderma
has
no
recognized
internal
organ
involvement
but
may
be
disfiguring
and
disabling
when
the
cutaneous
lesions
are
extensive
or
affect
children
.

There
is
no
accepted
or
proven
treatment
for
localized
scleroderma
.

Case
reports
of
11
patients
with
severe
,
extensive
localized
scleroderma
who
were
treated
with

D
-
penicillamine
are
summarized
in
this
article
.

This
drug
was
judged
to
have
a
favorable
effect
on
the
disease
course
in
7
(
64
%
)
of
11
patients
.

Improvement
began
within
3
to
6
months
and
consisted
of
cessation
of
active
cutaneous
lesions
in
all
7
patients
,
skin
softening
in
5
,
and
more
normal
growth
of
the
affected
limb
in
2
of
3
children
.

Joint
stiffness
and
contractures
also
improved
.

The
dose
of
D
-
penicillamine
associated
with
a
favorable
response
was
as
low
as
2
to
5
mg
/
kg
per
day
given
over
a
period
ranging
from
15
to
53
months
.

D
-
Penicillamine
caused

nephrotic
syndrome
in
1
patient
and
milder
reversible
proteinuria
in
3
other
patients
;
none
developed
renal
insufficiency
.

These
data
suggest
that
D
-
penicillamine
may
be
effective
in
severe
cases
of
localized
scleroderma
.

Preservation
of
renal
blood
flow
during
hypotension
induced
with
fenoldopam
in
dogs
.

The
introduction
of
drugs
that
could
induce
hypotension
with
different
pharmacological
actions
would
be
advantageous
because
side
effects
unique
to
a
specific
drug
could
be
minimized
by
selecting
appropriate
therapy
.

Specific

dopamine
-1
,

(
DA
1
)
and
dopamine
-2
(
DA
2
)
receptor
agonists
are
now
under
clinical
investigation
.

Fenoldopam
mesylate
is
a
specific
DA1
receptor
agonist
that
lowers
blood
pressure
by
vasodilatation
.

The
hypothesis
that
fenoldopam
could
be
used
to
induce
hypotension
and
preserve
blood
flow
to
the
kidney
was
tested
.

Systemic
aortic
blood
pressure
and
renal
blood
flow
were
measured
continuously
with
a
carotid
arterial
catheter
and
an
electromagnetic
flow
probe
respectively
,
in
order
to
compare
the
cardiovascular
and
renal
vascular
effects
of
fenoldopam
and
sodium

nitroprusside
in
ten
dogs
under
halothane
general
anaesthesia
.

Mean
arterial
pressure
was
decreased
30
+
/-

8
per
cent
from
control
with
infusion
of
fenoldopam
(
3.4
+
/-

2.0
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
)
and
34
+
/-
4
per
cent
with
infusion
of
sodium
nitroprusside

(
5.9
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
)
(
NS
)
.

Renal
blood
flow
(
RBF
)
increased
during
fenoldopam
-induced

hypotension
11
+
/-
7
per
cent
and
decreased
21
+
/-

8
per
cent
during
sodium

nitroprusside
-induced

hypotension
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
.

Sodium
nitroprusside
is
a
non
-
selective
arteriolar
and
venous
vasodilator
that
can
produce
redistribution
of
blood
flow
away
from
the
kidney
during
induced
hypotension
.

Fenoldopam
is
a
selective
dopamine
-1
(
DA1
)
receptor
agonist
that
causes
vasodilatation
to
the
kidney
and
other
organs
with
DA1
receptors
and
preserves
blood
flow
to
the

on
canine
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

Antiarrhythmic
effects
of
(
+
)
-
cibenzoline
and
(
-)-
cibenzoline
were
examined
using
two
canine
ventricular
arrhythmia
models
.

Digitalis

arrhythmia
,
which
is
suppressed
by
Na
channel
blockers
,
was
induced
by
intermittent
intravenous
(
i.v
.
)

injection
of
ouabain
in
pentobarbital
-anesthetized
dogs
.

Adrenaline
arrhythmia
,
which
is
suppressed
by
Ca
channel
blockers
,
was
induced
by
adrenaline
infusion
in

halothane
-anesthetized
dogs
.

Ten

.

(

)
-
cibenzoline
suppressed

digitalis
-
and
adrenaline
-induced
arrhythmias
,
respectively
.

The
minimum
effective
plasma
concentrations
of
(
+
)
-
cibenzoline
for
digitalis
-
and
adrenaline
-induced

arrhythmias
were
1.4
+
/-
0.4
and
2.0
+
/-

0.6
micrograms
/
ml
,
respectively
(
mean

,
n
=

)
.

A
lower
dose
of
1
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
of
(
-)-
cibenzoline
suppressed
the
digitalis
-induced
arrhythmia
,
whereas
5
mg

.
was
needed
to
suppress
adrenaline

-induced
arrhythmias
.

The
minimum
effective
plasma
concentrations
of
(

cibenzoline
for
digitalis

were
0.06

,
respectively
(

)
.

The
stronger
antiarrhythmic
effect
of
(
-)-
cibenzoline
indicates
that
(
-)-isomer
may
have
an
effect
nearly
5
-
20
times
stronger
in
suppressing
Na
channels
,
but
effects
of
both
drugs
on
Ca

may
be
almost
equipotent
.

Effect
of
Hibiscus
rosa
sinensis
on
reserpine
-induced
neurobehavioral
and
biochemical
alterations
in
rats
.

Effect
of
methanolic
extract
of
Hibiscus
rosa
sinensis

(
100
-
300
mg
/
kg
)
was
studied
on
reserpine
-induced
orofacial
dyskinesia
and
neurochemical
alterations
.

The
rats
were
treated
with
intraperitoneal
reserpine

(
1
mg
/
kg
,
ip
)
for
3
days
every
other
day
.

On
day
5
,
vacuous
chewing
movements
and
tongue
protrusions
were
counted
for
5
min
.

Reserpine
treated
rats
significantly
developed
vacuous
chewing
movements
and
tongue
protrusions
however
,
coadministration
of
Hibiscus
rosa
sinensis
roots
extract
(
100
,
200
and
300
mg
/
kg
,
per
orally
)
attenuated
the
effects
.

Biochemical
analysis
of
brain
revealed
that
the
reserpine
treatment
significantly
increased
lipid
peroxidation
and
decreased
levels
of
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
,
catalase
(
CAT
)
and
glutathione
reductase
(
GSH
)
,
an
index
of
oxidative
stress
process
.

Coadministration
of
extract
significantly
reduced
the
lipid
peroxidation
and
reversed
the
decrease
in
brain
SOD
,
CAT
and
GSH
levels
.

The
results
of
the
present
study
suggested
that
Hibiscus
rosa
sinensis
had
a
protective
role
against
reserpine
-induced
orofacial
dyskinesia
and
oxidative
stress
.

Comparison
of
aqueous
and
gellan
ophthalmic
timolol
with
placebo
on
the
24-hour
heart
rate
response
in
patients
on
treatment
for
glaucoma
.

PURPOSE
:

Topical
beta
-
blocker
treatment
is
routine
therapy
in
the
management
of
patients
with
glaucoma
.

Therapy
results
in
systemic
absorption
,
however
,
the
degree
of
reduction
of
resting
and
peak
heart
rate
has
not
been
quantified
.

DESIGN
:

This
trial
evaluated
the
effect
of
placebo
,
0.5
%
aqueous
timolol

(
timolol
solution
)
and
a
0.5
%
timolol
suspension
that
forms
a
gel
on
application
to
the
conjunctiva
(
timolol
gellan
)
on
the
24-hour
heart
rate
in
patients
currently
being
treated
for
glaucoma
to
quantify
the
reduction
in
mean
heart
rate
.

METHODS
:

Forty
-
three
Caucasian
patients
with
primary
open
-
angle
glaucoma
or
ocular
hypertension
with
a
mean
(
+
/-SD
)
age
of
63
(
+
/-8
)
years
were
randomized
and
crossed
over
in
a
double
-
masked
manner
to
14
days
of
treatment
with
placebo
(
morning
and
evening
in
both
eyes
)
,
timolol
solution
(
morning
and
evening
in
both
eyes
)
,
or
timolol
gellan
(
morning
in
both
eyes
with
placebo
in
the
evening
)
.

On
the
13th
day
of
each
period
,
heart
rate
was
recorded
continuously
during
a
typical
,
ambulant
24-hour
period
.

RESULTS
:

Both
timolol
solution
and
timolol
gellan
reduced
the
mean
24-hour
heart
rate
compared
with
placebo
(
P
or
=
.001
)
,
and
this
reduction
was
most
pronounced
during
the
daytime
(
-7.5
%
change
in
mean
heart
rate
,
-5.7
beats
/
min
)
.

Timolol
gellan
showed
a
numerically
but
not
significantly
smaller
reduction
in
24-hour
heart
rate
,
compared
with
timolol
solution
.

During
the
night
,
the
mean
12-hour
heart
rate
on
placebo
and
timolol
gellan
were
both
significantly
less
than
on
timolol
solution
;
the
difference
between
solution
and
gellan
treatments
was
statistically
significant
(
P
=
.01
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Both
timolol
solution
and
timolol
gellan
decrease
the
mean
24-hour
heart
rate
compared
with
placebo
.

This
response
was
most
pronounced
during
the
active
daytime
period
.

These
data
quantify
the
modest
bradycardia
associated
with
ophthalmic
beta
-
blocker
therapy
in
a
typical
patient
population
on
therapy
for
glaucoma
.

Although
exercise
performance
was
not
assessed
in
this
trial
,
reductions
of
this
magnitude
should
not
have
substantial
clinical
consequences
.

5
flourouracil
-induced
apical
ballooning
syndrome
:
a
case
report
.

The
apical
ballooning
syndrome

(
ABS
)
is
a
recently
described
stress
-
mediated
acute
cardiac
syndrome
characterized
by
transient
wall
-
motion
abnormalities
involving
the
apex
and
midventricle
with
hyperkinesis
of
the
basal
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
segments
without
obstructive
epicardial
coronary
disease
.

Cardiotoxicity
is
not
an
uncommon
adverse
effect
of
chemotherapeutic
agents
.

However
,
there
are
no
reports
of
ABS
secondary
to
chemotherapeutic
agents
.

We
describe
the
case
of
a
woman
who
developed
the
syndrome
after
chemotherapy
for
metastatic
cancer
.

A
79-year
-
old
woman
presented
with
typical
ischemic
chest
pain
,
elevated
cardiac
enzymes
with
significant
ST
-
segment
abnormalities
on
her
electrocardiogram
.

She
underwent
recent
chemotherapy
with
fluorouracil
for
metastatic
colorectal
cancer
.

Echocardiography
revealed
a
wall
-
motion
abnormality
involving
the
apical
and
periapical
segments
which
appeared
akinetic
.

Coronary
angiography
revealed
no
obstructive
coronary
lesions
.

The
patient
was
stabilized
with
medical
therapy
.

Four
weeks
later
she
remained
completely
asymptomatic
.

Echocardiogram
revealed
a
normal
ejection
fraction
and
a
resolution
of
the
apical
akinesis
.

Pathogenetic
mechanisms
of
cardiac
complications
in
cancer
patients
undergoing
chemotherapy
include
coronary
vasospasm
,
endothelial
damage
and
consequent
thrombus
formation
.

In
our
patient
,
both
supraphysiologic
levels
of
plasma
catecholamines
and
stress
related
neuropeptides
caused
by
cancer
diagnosis
as
well
as
chemotherapy
may
have
contributed
the
development
of
ABS
.

Reduction
of
pain
during
induction
with
target
-
controlled
propofol
and
remifentanil
.

BACKGROUND
:

Pain
on
injection
of
propofol
is
unpleasant
.

We
hypothesized
that
propofol
infusion

pain
might
be
prevented
by
infusing
remifentanil
before
starting
the
propofol
infusion
in
a
clinical
setting
where
target
-
controlled
infusions
(
TCI
)
of
both
drugs
were
used
.

A
prospective
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
was
performed
to
determine
the
effect
-
site
concentration
(
Ce
)
of
remifentanil
to
prevent
the
pain
without
producing
complications
.

METHODS
:

A
total
of
128
patients
undergoing
general
surgery
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
normal
saline
(
control
)
or
remifentanil
to
a
target
Ce
of
2
ng
ml(-1
)

(
R2
)
,
4
ng
ml(-1
)
(
R4
)
,
or
6
ng
ml(-1
)
(
R6
)
administered
via
TCI
.

After
the
target
Ce
was
achieved
,
the
infusion
of
propofol
was
started
.

Remifentanil
-related
complications
were
assessed
during
the
remifentanil
infusion
,
and
pain
caused
by
propofol
was
evaluated
using
a
four
-
point
scale
during
the
propofol
infusion
.

RESULTS
:

The
incidence
of
pain
was
significantly
lower
in
Groups
R4
and
R6
than
in
the
control
and
R2
groups
(
12/32
and
6/31
vs
26/31
and
25/32
,
respectively
,
P<0.001
)
.

Pain
was
less
severe
in
Groups
R4
and
R6
than
in
the
control
and
R2
groups
(
P<0.001
)
.

However
,
both
incidence
and
severity
of
pain
were
not
different
between
Groups
R4
and
R6
.

No
significant
complications
were
observed
during
the
study
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

During
induction
of
anaesthesia
with
TCI
of
propofol
and
remifentanil
,
a
significant
reduction
in
propofol
infusion

pain
was
achieved
without
significant
complications
by
prior
administration
of
remifentanil
at
a
target
Ce
of
4
ng
ml(-1
)
.

Prenatal
exposure
to
fluoxetine
induces
fetal
pulmonary
hypertension
in
the
rat
.

RATIONALE
:

Fluoxetine
is
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
antidepressant
widely
used
by
pregnant
women
.

Epidemiological
data
suggest
that
fluoxetine
exposure
prenatally
increases
the
prevalence
of
persistent
pulmonary
hypertension
syndrome
of
the
newborn
.

The
mechanism
responsible
for
this
effect
is
unclear
and
paradoxical
,
considering
the
current
evidence
of
a
pulmonary
hypertension
protective
fluoxetine
effect
in
adult
rodents
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
evaluate
the
fluoxetine
effect
on
fetal
rat
pulmonary
vascular
smooth
muscle
mechanical
properties
and
cell
proliferation
rate
.

METHODS
:

Pregnant
rats
were
treated
with
fluoxetine

(
10
mg
/
kg
)
from
Day
11
through
Day
21
of
gestation
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:

Fetuses
were
delivered
by
cesarean
section
.

As
compared
with
controls
,
fluoxetine
exposure
resulted
in
fetal
pulmonary
hypertension
as
evidenced
by
an
increase
in
the
weight
ratio
of
the
right
ventricle
to
the
left
ventricle
plus
septum
(
P
=
0.02
)
and
by
an
increase
in
pulmonary
arterial
medial
thickness
(
P
0.01
)
.

Postnatal
mortality
was
increased
among
experimental
animals
,
and
arterial
oxygen
saturation
was
96
+
/-

1
%
in
1-day
-
old
control
animals
and
significantly
lower
(
P
0.01
)
in
fluoxetine
-exposed
pups
(
79
+
/-
2
%
)
.

In
vitro
,
fluoxetine
induced
pulmonary
arterial
muscle
contraction
in
fetal
,
but
not
adult
,
animals
(
P
0.01
)
and
reduced
serotonin
-induced
contraction
at
both
ages
(
P
0.01
)
.

After
in
utero
exposure
to
a
low
fluoxetine
concentration
the
pulmonary
arterial
smooth
muscle
cell
proliferation
rate
was
significantly
increased
in
fetal
,
but
not
adult
,
cells
(
P
0.01
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
contrast
to
the
adult
,
fluoxetine
exposure
in
utero
induces
pulmonary
hypertension
in
the
fetal
rat
as
a
result
of
a
developmentally
regulated
increase
in
pulmonary
vascular
smooth
muscle
proliferation
.

Syncope
and
QT
prolongation
among
patients
treated
with
methadone
for
heroin
dependence
in
the
city
of
Copenhagen
.

BACKGROUND
:

Methadone
is
prescribed
to
heroin
addicts
to
decrease
illicit
opioid
use
.

Prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
in
the
ECG
of
patients
with
torsade
de
pointes

(
TdP
)
has
been
reported
in
methadone
users
.

As
heroin
addicts
sometimes
faint
while
using
illicit
drugs
,
doctors
might
attribute
too
many
episodes
of
syncope
to
illicit
drug
use
and
thereby
underestimate
the
incidence
of
TdP
in
this
special
population
,
and
the
high
mortality
in
this
population
may
,
in
part
,
be
caused
by
the
proarrhythmic
effect
of
methadone
.

METHODS
:

In
this
cross
-
sectional
study
interview
,
ECGs
and
blood
samples
were
collected
in
a
population
of
adult
heroin
addicts
treated
with
methadone
or
buprenorphine
on
a
daily
basis
.

Of
the
patients
at
the
Drug
Addiction
Service
in
the
municipal
of
Copenhagen
,
450
(
approximately
52
%
)
were
included
.

The
QT
interval
was
estimated
from
12
lead
ECGs
.

All
participants
were
interviewed
about
any
experience
of
syncope
.

The
association
between
opioid
dose
and
QT
,
and
methadone
dose
and
reporting
of
syncope
was
assessed
using
multivariate
linear
regression
and
logistic
regression
,
respectively
.

RESULTS
:

Methadone
dose
was
associated
with
longer
QT
interval
of
0.140
ms
/
mg
(
p
=
0.002
)
.

No
association
between
buprenorphine
and
QTc
was
found
.

Among
the
subjects
treated
with
methadone
,
28
%
men
and
32
%
women
had
prolonged
QTc
interval
.

None
of
the
subjects
treated
with
buprenorphine
had
QTc
interval
>
0.440
s((1/2
)
)
.

A
50
mg
higher
methadone
dose
was
associated
with
a
1.2
(
95
%
CI
1.1
to
1.4
)
times
higher
odds
for
syncope
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Methadone
is
associated
with
QT
prolongation
and
higher
reporting
of
syncope
in
a
population
of
heroin
addicts
.

Peripheral
neuropathy
caused
by
high
-
dose
cytosine
arabinoside
treatment
in
a
patient
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
.

The
central
nervous
system

toxicity
of
high
-
dose
cytosine
arabinoside
is
well
recognized
,
but
the
toxicity
of
cytosine
arabinoside

in
the
peripheral
nervous
system
has
been
infrequently
reported
.

A
49-year
-
old
Japanese
man
was
diagnosed
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
.

After
he
achieved
complete
remission
,
he
received
high
-
dose
cytosine
arabinoside
treatment
(
2
g
/
m2
twice
a
day
for
5
days
;
total
,
20
g
/
m2
)
as
consolidation
therapy
.

The
first
course
of
high
-
dose
cytosine
arabinoside
resulted
in
no
unusual
symptoms
,
but
on
day
21
of
the
second
course
of
treatment
,
the
patient
complained
of
numbness
in
his
right
foot
.

Electromyogram
and
nerve
-
conduction
studies
showed

peripheral
neuropathy
in
both
peroneal
nerves
.

This
neuropathy
was
gradually
resolving
;
however
,
after
the
patient
received
allogeneic
bone
marrow
transplantation
,
the
symptoms
worsened
,
with
the
development
of
graft
-
versus
-
host
disease
,
and
the
symptoms
subsequently
responded
to
methylprednisolone
.

Although
the
mechanisms
of
peripheral
neuropathy
are
still
unclear
,
high
-
dose
cytosine
arabinoside
is
a
therapy
that
is
potentially
toxic
to
the
peripheral
nervous
system
,
and
auto
/
alloimmunity
may
play
an
important
role
in
these
mechanisms
.

Atorvastatin

were
treated
with

Sirolimus
and
mycophenolate
mofetil
for
calcineurin
-
free
immunosuppression
in
renal
transplant
recipients
.

Calcineurin
inhibitors
,
such
as
cyclosporine
and
tacrolimus
,
have
been
available
for
almost
20
years
.

Although
these
drugs
are
highly
effective
and
represent
the
mainstay
of
transplant
immunosuppression
,
they
are
associated
with
acute
and
chronic
nephrotoxicity
.

Acute
nephrotoxicity
,
which
occurs
in
the
early
period
after
transplantation
,
leads
to
a
higher
rate
of
dialysis
,
and
chronic

nephrotoxicity
may
eventually
result
in
graft
loss
.

Acute
and
chronic
nephrotoxicity
is
becoming
more
common
as
the
use
of
marginal
kidneys
for
transplantation
increases
.

Two
recently
available
immunosuppressive
agents
,
mycophenolate
mofetil
and
sirolimus

(
rapamycin
)
,
have
no
nephrotoxicity
.

The
use
of
these
drugs
in
combination
with
other
agents
has
led
to
the
development
of
new
paradigms
of
immunosuppressive
therapy
.

This
paper
reviews
the
results
of
clinical
trials
that
have
investigated
these
new
approaches
to
immunosuppression
in
renal
transplant
recipients
.

Erythropoietin
restores
the
anemia
-induced
reduction
in
cyclophosphamide
cytotoxicity
in
rat
tumors
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
impact
of
anemia
prevention
by
recombinant
human
erythropoietin
(
rHuEPO
)
treatment
on
the
cytotoxicity
of
cyclophosphamide
in
solid
experimental
tumors
.

Anemia
was
induced
using
a
single
dose
of
carboplatin

(
50
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)

resulting
in
a
long
-
lasting
reduction
(
30
%
)
of
the
hemoglobin
concentration
.

In
a
second
group
,
the
development
of
anemia
was
prevented
by
rHuEPO
(
1000
IU
/
kg
)
administered
s.c
.

three
times
/
week
starting
7
days
before
carboplatin
application
.

Four
days
after
carboplatin
treatment
,
tumors

(
DS-
sarcoma
of
the
rat
)
were
implanted
s.c
.

onto
the
hind
food
dorsum
.

Neither
carboplatin
nor
rHuEPO
treatment
influenced
tumor
growth
rate
per
se
.

When
tumors
were
treated
with
a
single
dose
of
cyclophosphamide

(
60
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

5
days
after
implantation
,
a
growth
delay
with
a
subsequent
regrowth
of
the
tumors
was
observed
.

In
the
anemia
group
,
the
growth
delay
was
significantly
shorter
compared
with
nonanemic
controls
(
13.3
days
versus
8.6
days
)
.

In
the
group
where
anemia
was
prevented
by
rHuEPO
treatment
,
growth
delay
was
comparable
with
that
of
nonanemic
controls
(
13.3
days
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
chemotherapy
-
induced
anemia
reduces
cytotoxicity
of
cyclophosphamide
in
tumors
,
whereas
correction
of
anemia
by
rHuEPO
treatment
(
epoetin
alpha
)
increases
the
sensitivity
,
probably
as
a
result
of
an
improved
oxygen
supply
to
tumor
tissue
.

The
role
of
nitrergic
system
in
lidocaine
-induced
convulsion
in
the
mouse
.

The
effects
of
N

L
-
arginine
-

(
L

)
a
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
synthase
inhibitor
and
L
-
arginine
,
a
NO
precursor
,
were
investigated
on
lidocaine
-induced

convulsions
.

In
the
first
experiment
,
four
groups
of
mice
received
physiological
saline
(
0.9
%
)
,
L
-
arginine

(
300
mg

i.p
.
)
,
L

(
100
mg

)
and
diazepam

(
2
mg
/

)
,
respectively
.

Thirty
minutes
after
these
injections
,
all
mice
received
lidocaine

(
50
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
.

In
the
second
experiment
,
four
groups
of
mice
received
similar
treatment
in
the
first
experiment
,
and
30
min
after
these
injections
,
all
mice
received
a
higher
dose
of
lidocaine

(
80
mg
/
kg
)
.

L
-
NAME
(
100
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
and
diazepam

(
2
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
decreased
the
incidence
of
lidocaine

(
50
mg
/
kg)-induced
convulsions
.

In
contrast
,
the
L
-
arginine
treatment
increased
the
incidence
of
lidocaine

(
80
mg
/
kg
,
i.p.)-induced

convulsions
significantly
.

These
results
may
suggest
that
NO
is
a
proconvulsant
mediator
in
lidocaine

-induced

convulsions
.

Effect
of
intravenous
metoprolol
or
intravenous
metoprolol
plus
glucagon
on
dobutamine

-induced

myocardial
ischemia
.

STUDY
OBJECTIVE
:

To
determine
the
effect
of
metoprolol
on
dobutamine
stress
testing
with
technetium-99
m
sestamibi
single
-
photon
emission
computed
tomography
imaging
and
ST
-
segment
monitoring
,
and
to
assess
the
impact
of
intravenous
glucagon
on
metoprolol
's
effects
.

DESIGN
:

Randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
.

SETTING
:

Community
hospital
.

PATIENTS
:

Twenty
-
two
patients
with
known
reversible
perfusion
defects
.

INTERVENTION
:

Patients
underwent
dobutamine
stress
tests
per
standard
protocol
.

Before
dobutamine
was
begun
,
no
therapy
was
given
during
the
first
visit
,
and
patients
were
randomized
on
subsequent
visits
to
receive
metoprolol
or
metoprolol
plus
glucagon
1
mg
.

Metoprolol
was
dosed
to
achieve
a
resting
predobutamine
heart
rate
below
65
beats
/
minute
or
a
total
intravenous
dose
of
20
mg
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:

Metoprolol
reduced
maximum
heart
rate
31
%
,
summed
stress
scores
29
%
,
and
summed
difference
scores
43
%
versus
control
.

Metoprolol
plus
glucagon
also
reduced
the
maximum
heart
rate
29
%
versus
control
.

Summed
stress
and
summed
difference
scores
were
not
significantly
reduced
,
although
they
were
18
%
and
30
%
lower
,
respectively
,
than
control
.

No
significant
differences
were
found
in
any
parameter
between
metoprolol
and
metoprolol
-glucagon
.

CONCLUSION
:

During
dobutamine
stress
testing
,
metoprolol
attenuates
or
eliminates
evidence
of
myocardial
ischemia
.

Glucagon
1
mg
,
although
somewhat
effective
,
does
not
correct
this
effect
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
administered
clinically
.

Prednisolone
-induced

muscle
dysfunction
is
caused
more
by
atrophy
than
by
altered
acetylcholine
receptor
expression
.

Large
doses
of
glucocorticoids
can
alter
muscle
physiology
and
susceptibility
to
neuromuscular
blocking
drugs
by
mechanisms
not
clearly
understood
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
moderate
and
large
doses
of
prednisolone
on
muscle
function
and
pharmacology
,
and
their
relationship
to
changes
in
muscle
size
and
acetylcholine
receptor
(
AChR
)
expression
.

With
institutional
approval
,
35
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
randomly
allocated
to
receive
daily
subcutaneous
doses
of
10
mg
/
kg
prednisolone

(
P10
group
)
,
100
mg
/
kg
prednisolone

(
P100
group
)
,
or
an
equal
volume
of
saline
(
S
group
)
for
7
days
.

A
fourth
group
of
rats
was
pair
fed
(
food
restricted
)
with
the
P100
rats
for
7
days
(
FR
group
)
.

On
Day
8
,
the
nerve
-
evoked
peak
twitch
tensions
,
tetanic
tensions
,
and
fatigability
,
and
the
dose
-
response
curves
of
d
-
tubocurarine
in
the
tibialis
cranialis
muscle
were
measured
in
vivo
and
related
to
muscle
mass
or
expression
of
AChRs
.

Rate
of
body
weight
gain
was
depressed
in
the
P100
,
FR
,
and
P10
groups
compared
with
the
S
group
.

Tibialis
muscle
mass
was
smaller
in
the
P100
group
than
in
the
P10
or
S
groups
.

The
evoked
peak
twitch
and
tetanic
tensions
were
less
in
the
P100
group
than
in
the
P10
or
S
groups
,
however
,
tension
per
milligram
of
muscle
mass
was
greater
in
the
P100
group
than
in
the
S
group
.

The
50
%
effective
dose
of
d
-
tubocurarine

(
microg
/
kg
)
in
the
tibialis
muscle
was
smaller
in
the
P10
(
33.6
+
/-
5.4
)
than
in
the
S
(
61.9
+
/-
5.0
)
or
the
P100
(
71.3
+
/-

9.6
)
groups
.

AChR
expression
was
less
in
the
P10
group
than
in
the
S
group
.

The
evoked
tensions
correlated
with
muscle
mass
(
r(2
)
=
0.32
,
P
0.001
)
,
however
,
not
with
expression
of
AChR.
The
50
%
effective
dose
of
d
-
tubocurarine
did
not
correlate
with
muscle
mass
or
AChR
expression
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
neuromuscular
dysfunction
after
prednisolone
is
dose
-
dependent
,
and
derives
primarily
from
muscle
atrophy
and
derives
less
so
from
changes
in
AChR
expression
.

IMPLICATIONS
:

The
mechanisms
by
which
chronic
glucocorticoid
therapy
alters
neuromuscular
physiology
and
pharmacology
are
unclear
.

We
suggest
that
the
observed
effects
are
dose
-
dependent
and
derive
primarily
from
muscle
atrophy
and
derive
less
from
changes
in
acetylcholine
receptor
expression
.

Rapid
reversal
of
life
-
threatening
diltiazem
-induced

tetany
with
calcium
chloride
.

We
describe
a
patient
who
developed
tetany
with
sudden
respiratory
arrest
after
the
infusion
of
intravenous
diltiazem
.

The
administration
of
calcium
chloride
rapidly
resolved
the
patient
's
tetany
with
prompt
recovery
of
respiratory
function
,
averting
the
need
for
more
aggressive
airway
management
and
ventilatory
support
.

The
emergency
physician
should
be
aware
that
life
-
threatening
tetany
may
accompany
the
administration
of
intravenous
diltiazem
and
that
calcium
chloride
may
be
a
rapid
and
effective
remedy
.

Effects
of
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
on
hemostasis
in
patients
with
aneurysmal
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
.

Platelet
function
is
impaired
by
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
with
prominent
anti
-
inflammatory
properties
.

Their
safety
in
patients
undergoing
intracranial
surgery
is
under
debate
.

Patients
with
aneurysmal
subarachnoid
hemorrhage

(
SAH
)
were
randomized
to
receive
either
ketoprofen
,
100
mg
,
three
times
a
day
(
ketoprofen
group
,
n
=
9
)
or
a
weak
NSAID
,
acetaminophen
,
1
g
,
three
times
a
day
(
acetaminophen
group
,
n
=
9
)
starting
immediately
after
the
diagnosis
of
aneurysmal

SAH
.

Treatment
was
continued
for
3
days
postoperatively
.

Test
blood
samples
were
taken
before
treatment
and
surgery
as
well
as
on
the
first
,
third
,
and
fifth
postoperative
mornings
.

Maximal
platelet
aggregation

induced
by
6
microM
of
adenosine
diphosphate
decreased
after
administration
of
ketoprofen
.

Aggregation
was
lower
(
P
.05
)
in
the
ketoprofen
group
than
in
the
acetaminophen
group
just
before
surgery
and
on
the
third
postoperative
day
.

In
contrast
,
maximal
platelet
aggregation
increased
in
the
acetaminophen
group
on
the
third
postoperative
day
as
compared
with
the
pretreatment
platelet
aggregation
results
(
P
.05
)
.

One
patient
in
the
ketoprofen
group
developed
a
postoperative
intracranial
hematoma
.

Coagulation
(
prothrombin
time
[
PT
]
,
activated
partial
thromboplastin
time
[
APPT
]
,
fibrinogen
concentration
,
and
antithrombin
III
[
AT
III
]
)
was
comparable
between
the
two
groups
.

Ketoprofen
but
not
acetaminophen
impaired
platelet
function
in
patients
with
SAH
.

If
ketoprofen
is
used
before
surgery
on
cerebral
artery
aneurysms
,
it
may
pose
an
additional
risk
factor
for
hemorrhage
.

Value
of
methylprednisolone
in
prevention
of
the
arthralgia
-
myalgia
syndrome
associated
with
the
total
dose
infusion
of
iron
dextran
:
a
double
blind
randomized
trial
.

The
safety
and
efficacy
of
total
dose
infusion
(
TDI
)
of
iron
dextran
has
been
well
documented
.

In
40
%
of
treated
patients
,
an
arthralgia
-
myalgia
syndrome
develops
.

The
purpose
of
this
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
prospective
study
was
to
investigate
whether
intravenous
(
i.v
.
)

administration
of
methylprednisolone

(
MP
)
prevents
this
complication
.

Sixty
-
five
patients
,
34
women
and
31
men
,
ages
36
to
80
years
,
received
either
normal
saline
before
and
after
TDI
(
group
1
)
,
125
mg
i.v
.

MP
before
and
saline
after
TDI
(
group
2
)
,
or
125
mg
i.v
.

MP
before
and
after
TDI
(
group
3
)
.

Patients
were
observed
for
72
hours
and
reactions
were
recorded
and
graded
according
to
severity
.

Fifty
-
eight
percent
of
group
1
patients
,
33
%
of
group
2
,
and
26
%
of
group
3
had
reactions
to
TDI
.

The
severity
of
reactions
(
minimal
,
mild
,
and
moderate
,
respectively
)
was
as
follows
:
group
1
-
-6
,
6
,
and
2
;
group
2
-
-1
,
5
,
and
0
;
group
3
-
-5
,
1
,
and
0
.

Data
were
analyzed
by
the
two
-
sided
Fisher
's
exact
test
using
95
%
confidence
intervals
with
the
approximation
of
Woolf
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
administration
of
MP
before
and
after
TDI
reduces
the
frequency
and
severity
of
the
arthralgia
-
myalgia
syndrome
.

We
conclude
that
125
mg
i.v
.

MP
should
be
given
routinely
before
and
after
TDI
of
iron
dextran
.

Long
-
term
effects
of
vincristine
on
the
peripheral
nervous
system
.

Forty
patients
with
Non
-
Hodgkin
's
Lymphoma
treated
with
vincristine
between
1984
and
1990
(
cumulative
dose
12
mg
in
18
-
24
weeks
)
were
investigated
in
order
to
evaluate
the
long
term
effects
of
vincristine
on
the
peripheral
nervous
system
.

The
patients
were
interviewed
with
emphasis
on
neuropathic
symptoms
.

Physical
and
quantitative
sensory
examination
with
determination
of
vibratory
perception
and
thermal
discrimination
thresholds
were
performed
,
four
to
77
months
(
median
34
months
)
after
vincristine
treatment
.

Twenty
-
seven
patients
reported
neuropathic
symptoms
.

In
13
of
these
27
patients
symptoms
were
still
present
at
the
time
of
examination
.

In
these
patients
sensory
signs
and
symptoms
predominated
.

In
the
other
14
patients
symptoms
had
been
present
in
the
past
.

Symptoms
persisted
maximally
40
months
since
cessation
of
therapy
.

There
was
no
age
difference
between
patients
with
and
without
complaints
at
the
time
of
examination
.

Normal
reflexes
were
found
in
two
third
of
patients
.

Neuropathic
complaints
were
not
very
troublesome
on
the
long
term
.

It
is
concluded
that
with
the
above
mentioned
vincristine

dose
schedule
signs
and
symptoms
of
vincristine

neuropathy
are
reversible
for
a
great
deal
and
prognosis
is
fairly
good
.

A
case
of
polymyositis
in
a
patient
with
primary

cirrhosis
treated
with
D
-
penicillamine
.

Although
D
-
penicillamine
has
been
used
for
many
rheumatologic
diseases
,
toxicity
limits
its
usefulness
in
many
patients
.

Polymyositis
/
dermatomyositis
can
develop
as
one
of
the
autoimmune
complications
of
D

penicillamine
treatment
,
but
its
exact
pathogenesis
remains
unclear
.

We
report
a

.

We
described
the
special
clinical
course
of
the
patient
.

Patients
receiving
D

should
be
followed
carefully
for
the
development
of
autoimmune

Photodistributed

nifedipine
-induced
facial
telangiectasia
.

Five
months
after
starting
nifedipine

(
Adalat
)
,
two
patients
developed
photodistributed
facial
telangiectasia
,
which
became
more
noticeable
with
time
.

Neither
patient
complained
of
photosensitivity
or
flushing
.

Both
patients
reported
a
significant
cosmetic
improvement
after
discontinuing
the
drug
.

One
commenced
the
closely
related
drug
amlodipine
3
years
later
,
with
recurrence
of
telangiectasia
.

The
photodistribution
of
the
telangiectasia
suggests
a
significant
drug
/
light
interaction
.

Nephrotoxicity
of
cyclosporin
A
and
FK506
:
inhibition
of
calcineurin
phosphatase
.

Cyclosporin
A

(
CsA
;
50
mg
/
kg
)
and
Fujimycine

(
FK506
;
5
mg
/
kg
)
,
but
not
the
related
macrolide
immunosuppressant
rapamycin

(
5
mg
/
kg
)
,
caused
a
reduction
of
glomerular
filtration
rate
,
degenerative
changes
of
proximal
tubular
epithelium
,
and
hypertrophy
of
the
juxtaglomerular
apparatus
in
male
Wistar
rats
when
given
for
10
days
.

The
molecular
mechanisms
of
CsA
and
FK506
toxicity
were
investigated
.

Cyclophilin
A
and
FK506
-binding
protein
,
the
main
intracytoplasmic
receptors
for
CsA
and
FK506
,
respectively
,
were
each
detected
in
renal
tissue
extract
.

In
the
kidney
,
high
levels
of
immunoreactive
and
enzymatically
active
calcineurin
were
found
which
were
inhibited
by
the
immunosuppressants
CsA
and
FK506
,
but
not
by
rapamycin
.

Finally
,
specific
immunophilin
-
drug
-
calcineurin
complexes
formed
only
in
the
presence
of
CsA
and
FK506
,
but
not
rapamycin
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
nephrotoxic
effects
of
CsA
and
FK506
is
likely
mediated
through
binding
to
renal
immunophilin
and
inhibiting
calcineurin
phosphatase
.

Massive
cerebral
edema
associated
with
fulminant
hepatic
failure
in
acetaminophen
overdose
:
possible
role
of
cranial
decompression
.

Cerebral
edema
may
complicate
the
course
of
fulminant
hepatic
failure
.

Response
to
conventional
therapy
has
been
disappointing
.

We
present
a
patient
with
fatal
acetaminophen

-induced

fulminant
hepatic
failure
,
with
signs
and
symptoms
of
cerebral
edema
,
unresponsive
to
conventional
medical
therapy
.

Cranial
decompression
was
carried
out
.

A
justification
of
the
need
for
further
evaluation
of
cranial
decompression
in
such
patients
is
presented
.

Gentamicin

nephropathy
in
a
neonate
.

The
clinical
and
autopsy
findings
in
a
premature
baby
who
died
of
acute
renal
failure
after
therapy
with
gentamicin

(
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
and
penicillin
are
presented
.

The
serum
gentamicin
concentration
had
reached
toxic
levels
when
anuria
developed
.

Numerous

bodies
which
appeared
as
myelin
figures
in

under
the
electron

were
identified
in
the
proximal

.

The
pathological

induced
by
gentamicin
in
the
human

have
not
been
previously
reported
.

Anti-
carcinogenic
action
of
phenobarbital
given
simultaneously
with
diethylnitrosamine
in
the
rat
.

The
present
work
has
been
planned
in
order
to
elucidate
the
effect
of
phenobarbital

(
PB
:
15
mg
per
rat
of
ingested
dose
)
on
carcinogenesis
when
it
is
administered
simultaneously
with
diethylnitrosamine

(
DEN
:
10
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
.

Wistar
rats
(
180
g
)
were
treated
by
DEN
alone
or
by
DEN
+
PB
during
2
,
4
and
6
weeks
according
to
our
schedule
for
hepatocarcinogenesis
.

After
the
end
of
the
treatment
,
the
number
and
the
size
of
induced
PAS
positive
preneoplastic
foci
was
significantly
reduced
when
PB
was
given
simultaneously
with
DEN
for
4
and
6
weeks
.

The
mitotic
inhibition
and
the
production
of
micronuclei
normally
observed
after
partial
hepatectomy
in

DEN
treated
rats
were
also
significantly
decreased
in
DEN
+

PB
treated
rats
.

When
the
treatment
last
only
2
weeks
,
the
presence
of
PB
did
not
change
significantly
the
last
parameters
.

In
DEN
+
PB
treated
rats
,
the
survival
was
prolonged
and
the
tumor
incidence
decreased
as
compared
with
the
results
obtained
by
DEN
alone
.

It
is
concluded
that
PB
,
which
promotes
carcinogenesis
when
administered
after
the
DEN
treatment
,
reduces
the
carcinogen
effect
when
given
simultaneously
with
DEN
.

This
'
anti
-
carcinogen
'
effect
acts
on
the
initiation
as
well
as
on
the
promotion
of
the
precancerous
lesions
.

Biochemical
investigations
are
in
progress
to
obtain
more
information
about
this
'
paradoxical
'
PB
effect
.

Post
-
operative
rigidity
after
fentanyl
administration
.

A
case
of
thoraco
-
abdominal
rigidity
leading
to
respiratory
failure
is
described
in
the
post
-
operative
period
in
an
elderly
patient
who
received
a
moderate
dose
of
fentanyl
.

This
was
successfully
reversed
by
naloxone
.

The
mechanisms
possibly
implicated
in
this
accident
are
discussed
.

Postpartum

psychosis
induced
by
bromocriptine
.

Two
multigravida
patients
with
no
prior
psychiatric

history
were
seen
with
postpartum
psychosis
,
having
received
bromocriptine
for
inhibition
of
lactation
.

Bromocriptine
given
in
high
doses
has
been
associated
with
psychosis
in
patients
receiving
the
drug
for
Parkinson
's
disease
.

These
cases
demonstrate
that
bromocriptine
may
cause
psychosis
even
when
given
in
low
doses
.

A
prospective
study
on
the
dose
dependency
of
cardiotoxicity
induced
by
mitomycin
C
.

Since
1975
mitomycin
C

(
MMC
)
has
been
suggested
to
be
cardiotoxic
,
especially
when
combined
with
or
given
following
doxorubicin
.

Data
on
dose
dependency
or
incidence
concerning
this
side
effect
were
not
known
.

We
have
initiated
a
prospective
study
to
obtain
some
more
data
on
these
subjects
.

Forty
-
four

MMC

-treated
patients
were
studied
,
37
of
them
could
be
evaluated
.

All
patients
were
studied
by
repeated
physical
examinations
,
chest
X
-
rays
,
electro-
and
echocardiography
and
radionuclide
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(
EF
)
determinations
.

The
results
were
evaluated
per
cumulative
dose
level
.

One
of
the
patients
developed
cardiac
failure
after
30
mg
m-2
MMC
and
only
150
mg
m-2

doxorubicin
.

The
cardiac
failure
was
predicted
by
a
drop
in
EF
determined
during
a
cold
pressor
test
.

None
of
the
other
patients
developed
clinical
cardiotoxicity
,
nor
did
the
studied
parameters
change
.

The
literature
on
this
subject
was
also
reviewed
.

Based
on
the
combined
data
from
the
present
study
and
the
literature
,
we
suggest
that
MMC
-related
cardiotoxicity
is
dose
dependent
,
occurring
at
cumulative
dose
levels
of
30
mg
m-2
or
more
,
mainly
in
patients
also
(
previously
or
simultaneously
)
treated
with
doxorubicin
.

The
incidence
is
likely
to
be
less
than
10
%
even
for
this
risk
group
.

Phlorizin
-induced
glycosuria
does
not
prevent

gentamicin
nephrotoxicity
in
rats
.

Because
rats
with
streptozotocin

-induced

diabetes
mellitus

(
DM
)
have
a
high
solute
diuresis
(
glycosuria
of
10
to
12
g
/

)
,
we
have
suggested
that
this
may
in
part
be
responsible
for
their
resistance
to
gentamicin
-induced
acute
renal
failure

(
ARF
)
.

The
protection
from
gentamicin
nephrotoxicity
was
studied
in
non-
diabetic
rats
with
chronic
solute
diuresis
induced
by
blockage
of

glucose
reabsorption
with
phlorizin

(

.

DM
rats
with
mild
glycosuria
(
similar
in

that
of
the
P

)
were
also
studied
.

Unanesthetized

Tiapride
in
levodopa
-induced
involuntary
movements
.

Tiapride
,
a
substituted
benzamide
derivative
closely
related
to
metoclopramide
,
reduced

levodopa
-induced

peak
dose
involuntary
movements
in
16
patients
with
idiopathic
Parkinson
's
disease
.

However
,
an
unacceptable
increase
in
disability
from
Parkinsonism
with
aggravation
of
end
-
of
-
dose
akinesia
led
to
its
cessation
in

patients
.

Tiapride
had
no
effect
on

levodopa
-induced
early

of
"

These
results
fail
to
support
the

are
caused
by
overstimulation
of
a
separate

Effects
of
the
hippocampal
deep
brain
stimulation
on
cortical
epileptic
discharges
in
penicillin
-
induced
epilepsy
model
in
rats
.

AIM
:
Experimental
and
clinical
studies
have
revealed
that
hippocampal
DBS
can
control
epileptic
activity
,
but
the
mechanism
of
action
is
obscure
and
optimal
stimulation
parameters
are
not
clearly
defined
.

The
aim
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
high
frequency
hippocampal
stimulation
on
cortical
epileptic
activity
in
penicillin

-induced

epilepsy
model
.

MATERIAL
AND
METHODS
:
Twenty
-
five
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
were
implanted
DBS
electrodes
.

In
group-1
(
n=10
)
hippocampal
DBS
was
off
and
in
the
group-2
(
n=10
)
hippocampal
DBS
was
on
(
185
Hz
,
0.5V
,
1V
,
2V
,
and
5V
for
60
sec
)
following
penicillin
G
injection
intracortically
.

In
the
control
group
hippocampal
DBS
was
on
following
8
l
saline
injection
intracortically
.

EEG
recordings
were
obtained
before
and
15
minutes
following
penicillin
-
G
injection
,
and
at
10th
minutes
following
each
stimulus
for
analysis
in
terms
of
frequency
,
amplitude
,
and
power
spectrum
.

RESULTS
:

High
frequency
hippocampal
DBS
suppressed
the
acute
penicillin
-induced
cortical
epileptic
activity
independent
from
stimulus
intensity
.

In
the
control
group
,
hippocampal
stimulation
alone
lead
only
to
diffuse
slowing
of
cerebral
bioelectrical
activity
at
5V
stimulation
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
results
revealed
that
continuous
high
frequency
stimulation
of
the
hippocampus
suppressed
acute
cortical
epileptic
activity
effectively
without
causing
secondary
epileptic
discharges
.

These
results
are
important
in
terms
of
defining
the
optimal
parameters
of
hippocampal
DBS
in
patients
with
epilepsy
.

Neural
correlates
of
S
-
ketamine
induced

psychosis
during
overt
continuous
verbal
fluency
.

The
glutamatergic
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptor
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathophysiology
of
schizophrenia
.

Administered
to
healthy
volunteers
,
a
subanesthetic
dose
of
the
non
-
competitive
NMDA
receptor
antagonist
ketamine
leads
to
psychopathological
symptoms
similar
to
those
observed
in
schizophrenia
.

In
patients
with
schizophrenia
,
ketamine
exacerbates
the
core
symptoms
of
illness
,
supporting
the
hypothesis
of
a
glutamatergic
dysfunction
.

In
a
counterbalanced
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
double
-
blind
study
design
,
healthy
subjects
were
administered
a
continuous
subanesthetic
S
-
ketamine
infusion
while
differences
in
BOLD
responses
measured
with
fMRI
were
detected
.

During
the
scanning
period
,
subjects
performed
continuous
overt
verbal
fluency
tasks
(
phonological
,
lexical
and
semantic
)
.

Ketamine

-induced
psychopathological
symptoms
were
assessed
with
the
Positive
and
Negative
Syndrome
Scale
(
PANSS
)
.

Ketamine
elicited

psychosis
like
psychopathology
.

Post
-
hoc
t
-
tests
revealed
significant
differences
between
placebo
and
ketamine
for
the
amounts
of
words
generated
during
lexical
and
semantic
verbal
fluency
,
while
the
phonological
domain
remained
unaffected
.

Ketamine
led
to
enhanced
cortical
activations
in
supramarginal
and
frontal
brain
regions
for
phonological
and
lexical
verbal
fluency
,
but
not
for
semantic
verbal
fluency
.

Ketamine
induces
activation
changes
in
healthy
subjects
similar
to
those
observed
in
patients
with
schizophrenia
,
particularly
in
frontal
and
temporal
brain
regions
.

Our
results
provide
further
support
for
the
hypothesis
of
an
NMDA
receptor
dysfunction
in
the
pathophysiology
of
schizophrenia
.

Dopamine
is
not
essential
for
the
development
of
methamphetamine

-induced

neurotoxicity
.

It
is
widely
believed
that
dopamine

(
DA
)
mediates
methamphetamine

(
METH
)
-induced

toxicity
to
brain
dopaminergic
neurons
,
because
drugs
that
interfere
with
DA
neurotransmission
decrease
toxicity
,

whereas
drugs
that
increase
DA
neurotransmission
enhance

toxicity
.

However
,
temperature
effects
of
drugs
that
have
been
used
to
manipulate
brain
DA

neurotransmission
confound
interpretation
of
the
data
.

Here
we
show
that
the
recently
reported
ability
of
L
-
dihydroxyphenylalanine
to
reverse
the
protective
effect
of
alpha
-
methyl
-
para
-
tyrosine
on
METH
-induced
DA

neurotoxicity
is
also
confounded
by
drug
effects
on
body
temperature
.

Further
,
we
show
that
mice
genetically
engineered
to
be
deficient
in
brain
DA
develop
METH

neurotoxicity
,
as
long
as
the
thermic
effects
of
METH
are
preserved
.

In
addition
,
we
demonstrate
that
mice
genetically
engineered
to
have
unilateral
brain
DA

deficits
develop

METH
-induced

dopaminergic
deficits

that
are
of
comparable
magnitude
on
both
sides
of
the
brain
.

Taken
together
,
these
findings
demonstrate
that
DA
is
not
essential
for
the
development
of
METH
-induced
dopaminergic
neurotoxicity
and
suggest
that
mechanisms
independent
of
DA
warrant
more
intense
investigation
.

Brainstem

Vasoconstriction
appears
to
be
the
common

leading
to
a
wide

The
protective
role
of
Nrf2
in
streptozotocin
-induced
diabetic
nephropathy
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Diabetic
nephropathy
is
one
of
the
major
causes
of
renal
failure
,
which
is
accompanied
by
the
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
.

Nrf2
is
the
primary
transcription
factor
that
controls
the
antioxidant
response
essential
for
maintaining
cellular
redox
homeostasis
.

Here
,
we
report
our
findings
demonstrating
a
protective
role
of
Nrf2
against
diabetic
nephropathy
.

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS

:
We
explore
the
protective
role
of
Nrf2
against
diabetic
nephropathy
using
human
kidney
biopsy
tissues
from
diabetic
nephropathy
patients
,
a
streptozotocin
-induced
diabetic
nephropathy
model
in
Nrf2(-/-
)
mice
,
and
cultured
human
mesangial
cells
.

RESULTS
:

The
glomeruli
of
human
diabetic
nephropathy
patients
were
under
oxidative
stress
and
had
elevated
Nrf2
levels
.

In
the
animal
study
,
Nrf2
was
demonstrated
to
be
crucial
in
ameliorating

streptozotocin
-induced

renal
damage
.

This
is
evident
by
Nrf2(-/-
)
mice
having
higher
ROS
production
and
suffering
from
greater
oxidative
DNA
damage
and
renal
injury
compared
with
Nrf2(+/+
)
mice
.

Mechanistic
studies
in
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
systems
showed
that
the
Nrf2-mediated
protection
against
diabetic
nephropathy
is
,
at
least
,
partially
through
inhibition
of
transforming
growth
factor
-
beta1
(
TGF
-
beta1
)
and
reduction
of
extracellular
matrix
production
.

In
human
renal
mesangial
cells
,
high
glucose
induced
ROS
production
and
activated
expression
of
Nrf2
and
its
downstream
genes
.

Furthermore
,
activation
or
overexpression
of
Nrf2
inhibited
the
promoter
activity
of
TGF
-
beta1
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
whereas
knockdown
of
Nrf2
by
siRNA
enhanced
TGF
-
beta1
transcription
and
fibronectin
production
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
work
clearly
indicates
a
protective
role
of
Nrf2
in
diabetic
nephropathy
,
suggesting
that
dietary
or
therapeutic
activation
of
Nrf2
could
be
used
as
a
strategy
to
prevent
or
slow
down
the
progression
of
diabetic
nephropathy
.

High
-
dose

tranexamic
Acid
is
associated
with
nonischemic
clinical
seizures
in
cardiac
surgical
patients
.

BACKGROUND
:

In
2
separate
centers
,
we
observed
a
notable
increase
in
the
incidence
of
postoperative
convulsive

seizures
from
1.3
%
to
3.8
%
in
patients
having
undergone
major
cardiac
surgical
procedures
.

These
events
were
temporally
coincident
with
the
initial
use
of
high
-
dose
tranexamic
acid

(
TXA
)
therapy
after
withdrawal
of
aprotinin
from
general
clinical
usage
.

The
purpose
of
this
review
was
to
perform
a
retrospective
analysis
to
examine
whether
there
was
a
relation
between
TXA
usage
and
seizures
after
cardiac
surgery
.

METHODS
:

An
in
-
depth
chart
review
was
undertaken
in
all
24
patients
who
developed
perioperative
seizures
.

Electroencephalographic
activity
was
recorded
in
11
of
these
patients
,
and
all
patients
had
a
formal
neurological
evaluation
and
brain
imaging
studies
.

RESULTS
:

Twenty
-
one
of
the
24
patients
did
not
have
evidence
of
new
cerebral
ischemic
injury
,
but
seizures
were
likely
due
to
ischemic
brain
injury
in
3
patients
.

All
patients
with
seizures
did
not
have
permanent
neurological
abnormalities
.

All
24
patients
with
seizures
received
high
doses
of
TXA

intraoperatively
ranging
from
61
to
259
mg
/
kg
,
had
a
mean
age
of
69.9
years
,
and
21
of
24
had
undergone
open
chamber
rather
than
coronary
bypass
procedures
.

All
but
one
patient
were
managed
using
cardiopulmonary
bypass
.

No
evidence
of
brain
ischemic
,
metabolic
,
or

hyperthermia
-induced
causes
for
their
seizures
was
apparent
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
results
suggest
that
use
of
high
-
dose
TXA
in
older
patients
in
conjunction
with
cardiopulmonary
bypass
and
open
-
chamber
cardiac
surgery
is
associated
with
clinical
seizures
in
susceptible
patients
.

Recurrent
dysosmia
induced
by
pyrazinamide
.

Pyrazinamide
can
have
adverse
effects
such
as
hepatic
toxicity
,
hyperuricemia
or
digestive
disorders
.

In
rare
cases
,
alterations
in
taste
and
smell
function
have
been
reported
for
pyrazinamide
when
combined
with
other
drugs
.

We
report
a
case
of
reversible
olfactory
disorder
related
to
pyrazinamide
in
a
woman
,
with
a
positive
rechallenge
.

The
patient
presented
every
day
a
sensation
of
smelling
something
burning
15
min
after
drug
intake
.

Dysosmia
disappeared
completely
after
pyrazinamide
withdrawal
and
recurred
after
its
rechallenge
.

The
case
was
reported
to
the
Tunisian
Centre
of
Pharmacovigilance
.

Longitudinal
assessment
of

audiograms
in
a
phase
III
clinical
trial
of
difluoromethylornithine
and
sulindac
for
prevention
of
sporadic
colorectal
adenomas
.

A
phase
III
clinical
trial
assessed
the
recurrence
of
adenomatous
polyps
after
treatment
for
36
months
with
difluoromethylornithine

(
DFMO
)
plus
sulindac
or
matched
placebos
.

Temporary
hearing
loss
is
a
known
toxicity
of
treatment
with
DFMO
,
thus
a
comprehensive
approach
was
developed
to
analyze
serial
air
conduction
audiograms
.

The
generalized
estimating
equation
method
estimated
the
mean
difference
between
treatment
arms
with
regard
to
change
in
air
conduction
pure
tone
thresholds
while
accounting
for
within
-
subject
correlation
due
to
repeated
measurements
at
frequencies
.

Based
on
290
subjects
,
there
was
an
average
difference
of
0.50
dB
between
subjects
treated
with
DFMO
plus
sulindac
compared
with
those
treated
with
placebo
(
95
%
confidence
interval
,
-0.64
to
1.63
dB
;
P
=
0.39
)
,
adjusted
for
baseline
values
,
age
,
and
frequencies
.

In
the
normal
speech
range
of
500
to
3,000
Hz
,
an
estimated
difference
of
0.99
dB
(
-0.17
to
2.14
dB
;
P
=
0.09
)
was
detected
.

Dose
intensity
did
not
add
information
to
models
.

There
were
14
of
151
(
9.3
%
)
in
the
DFMO
plus
sulindac
group
and
4
of
139
(
2.9
%
)
in
the
placebo
group
who
experienced
at
least
15
dB
hearing
reduction
from
baseline
in
2
or
more
consecutive
frequencies
across
the
entire
range
tested
(
P
=
0.02
)
.

Follow
-
up
air
conduction
done
at
least
6
months
after
end
of
treatment
showed
an
adjusted
mean
difference
in
hearing
thresholds
of
1.08
dB
(
-0.81
to
2.96
dB
;
P
=
0.26
)
between
treatment
arms
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
proportion
of
subjects
in
the
DFMO
plus
sulindac
group
who
experienced
clinically
significant
hearing
loss
compared
with
the
placebo
group
.

The
estimated
attributable
risk
of
ototoxicity
from
exposure
to
the
drug
is
8.4
%
(
95
%
confidence
interval
,
-2.0
%
to
18.8
%
;
P
=
0.12
)
.

There
is
a
2
dB
difference
in
mean
threshold
for
patients
treated
with
DFMO
plus
sulindac
compared
with
those
treated
with

Increased
mental
slowing

associated
with
the
APOE
epsilon4
allele
after
trihexyphenidyl
oral
anticholinergic
challenge
in
healthy
elderly
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
examine
the
relationship
between
APOE
epsilon4
and
subjective
effects
of
trihexyphenidyl
on
measures
reflecting
sedation
and
confusion
and
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
trihexyphenidyl

-induced
subjective
effects
and
objective
memory
performance
.

METHODS
:

This
study
comprised
24
cognitively
intact
,
health
elderly
adults
(
12
APOE
epsilon4
carriers
)
at
an
outpatient
geriatric
psychiatry
research
clinic
.

This
was
a
randomized
,
double
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
three
-
way
,
crossover
experimental
design
.

All
participants
received
1.0
mg
or
2.0
mg
trihexyphenidyl
or
placebo
administered
in
counterbalanced
sequences
over
a
period
of
three
consecutive
weeks
.

Bond
and
Lader
's
visual
analog
scales
and
alternate
versions
of
the
Buschke
Selective
Reminding
Test
were
administered
in
a
repeated
measures
design
at
baseline
,
1
,
2.5
,
and
5
hours
postdrug
administration
.

RESULTS
:

A
2.0-mg
oral
dose
of

trihexyphenidyl
resulted
in
increased
subjective
ratings
of
mental
slowness
in
carriers
of
the
APOE
epsilon4
allele
only
.

Drug
effects
as
determined
by
difference
scores
between
2.0
mg
trihexyphenidyl
and
placebo
on
ratings
of
mental
slowness
significantly
correlated
with
total
and
delayed
recall
on
the
Buschke
Selective
Reminding
Test
in
carriers
of
the
APOE
epsilon4
allele
only
.

However
,
no
significant
effects
were
found
with
other
visual
analog
scales
reflecting
subjective
sedation
and
clear
-
headedness
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
epsilon4
allele
in
healthy
elderly
was
associated
with
increased
subjective
mental
slowing
after
trihexyphenidyl
anticholinergic
challenge
.

Behavioral
effects
of
pubertal
anabolic
androgenic

steroid
exposure
in
male
rats
with
low
serotonin
.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
interactive
effects
of
chronic
anabolic
androgenic
steroid

(
AAS
)
exposure
and
brain
serotonin

(
5-hydroxytryptamine
,
5-HT
)
depletion
on
behavior
of
pubertal
male
rats
.

Serotonin
was
depleted
beginning
on
postnatal
day
26
with
parachlorophenylalanine

(
PCPA
100
mg
/
kg
,
every
other
day
)
;

controls
received
saline
.

At
puberty
(
P40
)
,
half
the
PCPA
-treated
rats
and
half
the
saline
-
treated
rats
began
treatment
with
testosterone

(
T
,
5
mg
/
kg
,
5
days
/
week
)
.

Behavioral
measures
included
locomotion
,
irritability
,
copulation
,
partner
preference
,
and
aggression
.

Animals
were
tested
for
aggression
in
their
home
cage
,
both
with
and
without
physical
provocation
(
mild
tail
pinch
)
.

Brain
levels
of
5-HT
and
its
metabolite
,
5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid

(
5-HIAA
)
,
were
determined
using
HPLC
.

PCPA
significantly
and
substantially
depleted

5-HT
and
5-HIAA
in
all
brain
regions
examined
.

Chronic
T
treatment
significantly
decreased

5-HT
and
5-HIAA
in
certain
brain
areas
,
but
to
a
much
lesser
extent
than
PCPA
.

Chronic
exposure
to
PCPA
alone
significantly
decreased
locomotor
activity
and
increased
irritability
but
had
no
effect
on
sexual
behavior
,
partner
preference
,
or
aggression
.

T
alone
had
no
effect
on
locomotion
,
irritability
,
or
sexual
behavior
but
increased
partner
preference
and
aggression
.

The
most
striking
effect
of
combining
T
+
PCPA
was
a
significant
increase
in
attack
frequency
as
well
as
a
significant
decrease
in
the
latency
to
attack
,
particularly
following
physical
provocation
.

Based
on
these
data
,
it
can
be
speculated
that
pubertal
AAS
users
with
low
central
5-HT
may
be
especially
prone
to
exhibit
aggressive
behavior
.

Intracavitary
chemotherapy
(
paclitaxel
/
carboplatin
liquid
crystalline
cubic
phases
)
for
recurrent

glioblastoma
--
clinical
observations
.

Human
malignant

brain
tumors
have
a
poor
prognosis
in
spite
of
surgery
and
radiation
therapy
.

Cubic
phases
consist
of
curved
biocontinuous
lipid
bilayers
,
separating
two
congruent
networks
of
water
channels
.

Used
as
a
host
for
cytotoxic
drugs
,
the
gel
-
like
matrix
can
easily
be
applied
to
the
walls
of
a
surgical
resection
cavity
.

For
human
glioblastoma
recurrences
,
the
feasibility
,
safety
,
and
short
-
term
effects
of
a
surgical
intracavitary
application
of
paclitaxel
and
carboplatin
encapsulated
by
liquid
crystalline
cubic
phases
are
examined
in
a
pilot
study
.

A
total
of
12
patients
with
a
recurrence
of
a
glioblastoma
multiforme
underwent
re
-
resection
and
received
an
intracavitary
application
of
paclitaxel
and
carboplatin
cubic
phases
in
different
dosages
.

Six
of
the
patients
received
more
than
15
mg
paclitaxel
and
suffered
from
moderate
to
severe
brain
edema
,
while
the
remaining
patients
received
only
a
total
of
15
mg
paclitaxel
.

In
the
latter
group
,
brain
edema
was
markedly
reduced
and
dealt
medically
.

Intracavitary
chemotherapy
in
recurrent

glioblastoma
using
cubic
phases
is
feasible
and
safe
,
yet
the
clinical
benefit
remains
to
be
examined
in
a
clinical
phase
II
study
.

Methylphenidate
-induced
obsessive
-
compulsive
symptoms
in
an
elderly
man
.

An
82-year
-
old
man
with
treatment
-
resistant
depression
and
early
Alzheimer
's
disease
was
started
on
methylphenidate
.

Significant

obsessive
-
compulsive
behavior
ensued
but
diminished
over
several
weeks
when
methylphenidate
was
replaced
by
fluvoxamine
.

The
patient
had
no
prior
psychiatric
history
,
but
he
had
a
sister
with
obsessive
-
compulsive
disorder
.

It
appears
that
methylphenidate
precipitated
the
patient
's
pathological
behavior
.

Cardiac
arrest
after
intravenous
metoclopramide
-
a
case
of
five
repeated
injections
of
metoclopramide
causing
five
episodes
of
cardiac
arrest
.

We
describe
a
patient
where
intravenous
injection
of
metoclopramide
was
immediately
followed
by
asystole
repeatedly
.

The
patient
received
metoclopramide
10
mg
i.v
.

five
times
during
48
h.
After
interviewing
the
attending
nurses
and
reviewing
the
written
documentation
,
it
is
clear
that
every
administration
of
metoclopramide
was
immediately
(
within
s
)
followed
by
asystole
.

The
asystole
lasted
15
-
30
s
on
four
occasions
,
on
one
occasion
it
lasted
2
min
.

The
patient
received
atropine

0.5
-
1
mg
and
chest
compressions
,
before
sinus
rhythm
again
took
over
.

We
interpret
this
as
episodes
of
cardiac
arrest
caused
by
metoclopramide
.

The
rapid
injection
via
the
central
venous
route
and
the
concomitant
tapering
of
dopamine
infusion
might
have
contributed
in
precipitating
the
adverse
drug
reaction
.

Severe
immune
hemolytic
anemia

associated
with
prophylactic
use
of
cefotetan
in
obstetric
and
gynecologic
procedures
.

Second-
and

third
-
generation
cephalosporins
,
especially
cefotetan
,
are
increasingly
associated
with
severe
,
sometimes
fatal
immune
hemolytic
anemia
.

We
noticed
that
10
of
our
35
cases
of
cefotetan
-induced

hemolytic
anemias
were
in
patients
who
had
received
cefotetan
prophylactically
for
obstetric
and
gynecologic
procedures
.

Eight
of
these
cases
of
severe
immune
hemolytic
anemia
are
described
.

Cauda
equina
syndrome
after
spinal
anaesthesia
with
hyperbaric
5
%
lignocaine
:
a
review
of
six
cases
of
cauda
equina
syndrome
reported
to
the
Swedish
Pharmaceutical
Insurance
1993
-
1997
.

Six
cases
of
cauda
equina
syndrome
with
varying
severity
were
reported
to
the
Swedish
Pharmaceutical
Insurance
during
the
period
1993
-
1997
.

All
were
associated
with
spinal
anaesthesia
using
hyperbaric
5
%
lignocaine
.

Five
cases
had
single
-
shot
spinal
anaesthesia
and
one
had
a
repeat
spinal
anaesthetic
due
to
inadequate
block
.

The
dose
of
hyperbaric
5
%
lignocaine

administered
ranged
from
60
to
120
mg
.

Three
of
the
cases
were
most
likely
caused
by
direct
neurotoxicity
of
hyperbaric
5
%
lignocaine
.

In
the
other
3
cases
,
direct
neurotoxicity
was
also
probable
,
but
unfortunately
radiological
investigations
were
not
done
to
definitely
exclude
a
compressive
aetiology
.

All
cases
sustained
permanent
neurological
deficits
.

We
recommend
that
hyperbaric
lignocaine
should
be
administered
in
concentrations
not
greater
than
2
%
and
at
a
total
dose
preferably
not
exceeding
60
mg
.

Cortical
motor
overactivation
in
parkinsonian
patients
with
L
-
dopa
-induced
peak
-
dose
dyskinesia
.

We
have
studied
the
regional
cerebral
blood
flow
(
rCBF
)
changes
induced
by
the
execution
of
a
finger
-
to
-
thumb
opposition
motor
task
in
the
supplementary
and
primary
motor
cortex
of
two
groups
of
parkinsonian
patients
on
L
-
dopa
medication
,
the
first
one
without

L
-
dopa
induced
dyskinesia

(
n
=
23
)
and
the
other
with
moderate
peak
-
dose
dyskinesia

(
n
=
15
)
,
and
of
a
group
of
14
normal
subjects
.

Single
photon
emission
tomography
with
i.v
.

133Xe
was
used
to
measure
the
rCBF
changes
.

The
dyskinetic
parkinsonian
patients
exhibited
a
pattern
of
response
which
was
markedly
different
from
those
of
the
normal
subjects
and
non-
dyskinetic
parkinsonian
patients
,
with
a
significant
overactivation
in
the
supplementary
motor
area
and
the
ipsi-
and
contralateral
primary
motor
areas
.

These
results
are
compatible
with
the
hypothesis
that
an
hyperkinetic
abnormal
involuntary
movement
,
like
L
-
dopa
-induced
peak
dose
dyskinesia
,
is
due
to
a
disinhibition
of
the
primary
and
associated
motor
cortex
secondary
to
an
excessive
outflow
of
the
pallidothalamocortical
motor
loop
.

Dexamethasone
-induced
ocular
hypertension
in
perfusion
-
cultured
human
eyes
.

PURPOSE
:

Glucocorticoid
administration
can
lead
to
the
development
of
ocular
hypertension
and
corticosteroid
glaucoma
in
a
subset
of
the
population
through
a
decrease
in
the
aqueous
humor
outflow
facility
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
glucocorticoid
treatment
can
directly
affect
the
outflow
facility
of
isolated
,
perfusion
-
cultured
human
eyes
.

METHODS
:

The
anterior
segments
of
human
donor
eyes
from
regional
eye
banks
were
placed
in
a
constant
flow
,
variable
pressure
perfusion
culture
system
.

Paired
eyes
were
perfused
in
serum
-
free
media
with
or
without
10(-7
)
M
dexamethasone
for
12
days
.

Intraocular
pressure
was
monitored
daily
.

After
incubation
,
the
eyes
were
morphologically
characterized
by
light
microscopy
,
transmission
and
scanning
electron
microscopy
,
and
scanning
laser
confocal
microscopy
.

RESULTS
:

A
significant
increase
in
intraocular
pressure
developed
in
13
of
the
44
pairs
of
eyes
perfused
with
dexamethasone
with
an
average
pressure
rise
of
17.5
+
/-

3.8
mm
Hg
after
12
days
of
dexamethasone
exposure
.

The
contralateral
control
eyes
,
which
did
not
receive
dexamethasone
,
maintained
a
stable
intraocular
pressure
during
the
same
period
.

The
outflow
pathway
of
the
untreated
eyes
appeared
morphologically
normal
.

In
contrast
,
the
dexamethasone
-treated
hypertensive
eyes
had
thickened
trabecular
beams
,
decreased
intertrabecular
spaces
,
thickened
juxtacanalicular
tissue
,
activated
trabecular
meshwork
cells
,
and
increased
amounts
of
amorphogranular
extracellular
material
,
especially
in
the
juxtacanalicular
tissue
and
beneath
the
endothelial
lining
of
the
canal
of
Schlemm
.

The
dexamethasone
-treated
nonresponder
eyes
appeared
to
be
morphologically
similar
to
the
untreated
eyes
,
although
several
subtle
dexamethasone
-induced
morphologic
changes
were
evident
.

CONCLUSION
:

Dexamethasone
treatment
of
isolated
,
perfusion
-
cultured
human
eyes
led
to
the
generation
of
ocular
hypertension
in
approximately
30
%
of
the
dexamethasone
-treated
eyes
.

Steroid
treatment
resulted
in
morphologic
changes
in
the
trabecular
meshwork
similar
to
those
reported
for
corticosteroid
glaucoma
and
open
angle
glaucoma
.

This
system
may
provide
an
acute
model
in
which
to
study
the
pathogenic
mechanisms
involved
in
steroid
glaucoma
and
primary
open
angle
glaucoma
.

Cognitive
deterioration
from
long
-
term
abuse
of
dextromethorphan
:
a
case
report
.

Dextromethorphan
(
DM
)
,
the
dextrorotatory
isomer
of
3-hydroxy
-
N
-
methylmorphinan
,
is
the
main
ingredient
in
a
number
of
widely
available
,
over
-
the
-
counter
antitussives
.

Initial
studies
(
Bornstein
1968
)
showed
that
it
possessed
no
respiratory
suppressant
effects
and
no
addiction
liability
.

Subsequently
,
however
,
several
articles
reporting
abuse
of
this
drug
have
appeared
in
the
literature
.

The
drug
is
known
to
cause
a
variety
of
acute
toxic
effects
,
ranging
from
nausea
,
restlessness
,
insomnia
,
ataxia
,
slurred
speech
and
nystagmus
to
mood
changes
,
perceptual
alterations
,
inattention
,
disorientation
and
aggressive
behavior
(

.

There
have
also
been
two
reported
fatalities
from
DM

overdoses
(
Fleming
1986
)
.

However
,
there
are
no
reports
describing
the
effects
of
chronic
abuse
.

This
report
describes
a
case
of
cognitive
deterioration
resulting
from
prolonged
use
of

Long
-
term
lithium
treatment
and
the
kidney
.

Interim
report
on
fifty
patients
.

This
is
a
report
on
the
first
part
of
our
study
of
the
effects
of
long
-
term
lithium
treatment
on
the
kidney
.

Creatinine
clearance
,
maximum
urinary
osmolality
and
24
hour
urine
volume
have
been
tested
in
50
affectively
ill
patients
who
have
been
on
long
-
term
lithium
for
more
than
one
year
.

These
findings
have
been
compared
with
norms
and
with
values
of
the
same
tests
from
screening
prior
to
lithium
,
available
for
most
of
our
patients
.

No
evidence
was
found
for
any
reduction
of
glomerular
filtration
during
lithium
treatment
.

Low
clearance
values
found
in
several
patients
could
be
accounted
for
by
their
age
and
their
pre-
lithium
values
.

Urinary
concentration
defect
appeared
frequent
but
the
extent
of
the
impairment
is
difficult
to
assess
because
of
the
uncertainty
about
the
norms
applicable
to
this
group
of
patients
.

The
concentration
defect
appeared
reversible
,
at
least
in
part
.

Polyuria
above

3
litres/24

hours
was
found
in
10
%
of
patients
.

An
attempt
is
made
to
draw
practical
conclusions
from
the
preliminary
findings
.

Complete

heart
block
following
a
single
dose
of
trazodone
.

Forty
minutes
after
receiving
a
single
starting
dose
of
trazodone
,
a
patient
developed
complete
heart
block
.

The
case
illustrates
that
,
despite
the
results
of
earlier
studies
,
trazodone
's
effect
on
cardiac
conduction
may
be
severe
in
individuals
at
risk
for
conduction
delay
.

Quinidine
phenylethylbarbiturate
-induced
fulminant
hepatitis
in
a
pregnant
woman
.

A
case
report
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
19-year
-
old
Laotian
patient
affected
by
fulminant
hepatitis
during
the
third
trimester
of
her
pregnancy
after
a
1-month
administration
of
quinidine
phenylethylbarbiturate
.

After
delivery
,
the
patient
underwent
orthotopic
liver
transplantation
.

The
patient
was
in
good
condition
16
months
after
liver
transplantation
.

Quinidine
itself
or
phenylethylbarbiturate
may
be
responsible
for
fulminant
hepatitis
in
this
patient
.

The
epidemiology
of
the
acute
flank
pain
syndrome
from
suprofen
.

Suprofen
,
a
new
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
,
was
marketed
in
early
1986
as
an
analgesic
agent
.

Until
physicians
began
reporting
an
unusual
acute
flank
pain
syndrome
to
the
spontaneous
reporting
system
,
700,000
persons
used
the
drug
in
the
United
States
.

Through
August
1986
,
a
total
of
163
cases
of
this
syndrome
were
reported
.

To
elucidate
the
epidemiology
of
the
syndrome
,
a
case
-
control
study
was
performed
,
comparing
62
of
the
case
patients
who
had
been
reported
to
the
spontaneous
reporting
system
to
185
suprofen
-exposed
control
subjects
who
did
not
have
the
syndrome
.

Case
patients
were
more
likely
to
be
men
(
odds
ratio
,
3.8
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
1.2
-
12.1
)
,
suffer
from
hay
fever
and
asthma

(
odds
ratio
,
3.4
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
1.0
-
11.9
)
;
to
participate
in
regular
exercise
(
odds
ratio
,
5.9
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
1.1
-
30.7
)
,
especially
in
the
use
of
Nautilus
equipment
(
p
=
0.02
)
;
and
to
use
alcohol

(
odds
ratio
,
4.4
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
1.1
-
17.5
)
.

Possible
risk
factors
included
young
age
,
concurrent
use
of
other
analgesic
agents
(
especially
ibuprofen
)
,
preexisting
renal
disease
,
a
history
of
kidney
stones
,
a
history
of
gout
,
a
recent
increase
in
activity
,
a
recent
increase
in
sun
exposure
,
and
residence
in
the
Sunbelt
.

These
were
findings
that
were
suggestive
but
did
not
reach
conventional
statistical
significance
.

These
findings
are
consistent
with
the
postulated
mechanism
for
this
unusual
syndrome
:
acute
diffuse
crystallization
of
uric
acid
in
renal
tubules
.

Hemolytic
-
uremic
syndrome
associated
with
ingestion
of
quinine
.

Hemolytic
-
uremic
syndrome
following
quinine
ingestion
is
a
newly
described
phenomenon
,
with
just
two
previous
descriptions
of
4
cases
in
the
literature
.

We
describe
a
5th
case
.

The
reaction
may
be
mediated
by
the
presence
of
antibodies
reactive
against
platelets
in
the
presence
of
quinine
.

Treatment
has
included
use
of
plasma
exchange
,
prednisone
,
aspirin
,
and
dipyridamole
.

The
patients
have
all
regained
some
degree
of
renal
function
.

However
,
it
is
unclear
whether
pharmacological
treatment
or
spontaneous
resolution
is
responsible
for
the
improvement
.

Quinine
-associated

hemolytic
-
uremic
syndrome
probably
occurs
more
often
than
is
recognized
.

It
is
important
to
recognize
this
reaction
when
it
occurs
and
to
avoid
further
quinine
exposure
,
since
the
reaction
seems
to
be
recurrent
.

Pyeloureteral
filling
defects
associated
with
systemic
anticoagulation
:
a
case
report
.

The
etiology
of
pyeloureteritis
cystica
has
long
been
attributed
to
chronic
infection
and
inflammation
.

A
case
is
presented
that
is
unique
in
that
the
acute
onset
and
the
rapid
resolution
of
pyeloureteral
filling
defects
in
this
patient
were
documented
by
radiography
.

There
is
no
evidence
of
antecedent
or
concurrent
infection
in
this
patient
.

The
disease
occurred
subsequent
to
the
initiation
of
heparin
therapy
for
suspected
pelvic
thrombophlebitis
and
cleared
rapidly
subsequent
to
its
discontinuation
.

The
rate
of
resolution
of
the
radiographic
findings
may
be
helpful
in
distinguishing
between
true
pyeloureteritis
cystica
and
submucosal
hemorrhage
.

Changes
in
peroxisomes
in
preneoplastic
liver
and
hepatoma
of
mice
induced
by
alpha
-
benzene
hexachloride
.

Peroxisomes
in
hepatomas
and
hyperplastic
preneoplastic
liver
lesions
induced
in
mice
by
500
ppm

alpha
-
benzene
hexachloride
were
examined
histochemically
and
electron
microscopically
.

Although
most
of
the
hepatomas
were
well
-
differentiated
tumors
and
contained
a
considerable
number
of
peroxisomes
,
the
tumor
cells
did
not
respond
to
ethyl
-
alpha
-
p
-
chlorophenoxyisobutyrate
with
proliferation
of
peroxisomes
.

At
the
16th
week
of
carcinogen
feeding
,
hyperplastic
nodules
appeared
and
advanced
to
further
stages
.

A
majority
of
the
nodules
showed
a
considerable
number
of
peroxisomes
and
the
inductive
proliferation
of
peroxisomes
.

Within
the
nodules
,
foci
of
proliferation
of
the
cells
that
showed
no
inducibility
of
proliferation
of
peroxisomes
appeared
.

These
cells
proliferated
further
,
replacing
the
most
part
of
the
nodules
,
and
with
this
process
hepatomas
appeared
to
have
been
formed
.

No
abnormal
matrical
inclusions
of
peroxisomes
were
formed
in
the
cells
of
hyperplastic
nodules
by
ethyl
-
alpha
-
p
-
chlorophenoxyisobutyrate
unlike
in
the
case
of
rats
.

Quinidine
hepatitis
.

Long
-
term
administration
of
quinidine
was
associated
with
persistent
elevation
of
serum
concentrations
of
SGOT
,
lactic
acid
dehydrogenase
,
and
alkaline
phosphatase
.

Liver
biopsy
showed
active
hepatitis
.

Discontinuance
of
quinidine
therapy
led
to
normalization
of
liver
function
tests
.

A
challenge
dose
of

quinidine
caused
clinical
symptoms
and
abrupt
elevation
of
SGOT
,
alkaline
phosphatase
,
and
lactic
acid
dehydrogenase
values
.

We
concluded
that
this
patient
had
quinidine
hepatotoxicity
and
believe
that
this
is
the
first
case
reported
with
liver
biopsy
documentation
.

This
report
also
suggests
that
,
even
after
long
-
term
administration
,
the
hepatic
toxicity
is
reversible
.

Cholesteryl
hemisuccinate
treatment
protects
rodents
from
the
toxic
effects
of
acetaminophen
,
adriamycin
,
carbon
tetrachloride
,
chloroform
and
galactosamine
.

In
addition
to
its
use
as
a
stabilizer
/
rigidifier
of
membranes
,
cholesteryl
hemisuccinate
,
tris
salt

(
CS
)
administration
has
also
been
shown
to
protect
rats
from
the
hepatotoxic
effects
of
carbon
tetrachloride

(
CCl4
)
.

To
further
our
understanding
of
the
mechanism
of
CS
cytoprotection
,
we
examined
in
rats
and
mice
the
protective
abilities
of
CS
and
the
non
-
hydrolyzable
ether
form
of
CS
,
gamma
-
cholesteryloxybutyric
acid
,
tris
salt

(
CSE
)
against
acetaminophen
-
,
adriamycin
-
,
carbon
tetrachloride
-
,
chloroform
-
and
galactosamine
-induced
toxicity
.

The
results
of
these
studies
demonstrated
that
CS
-mediated
protection
is
not
selective
for
a
particular
species
,
organ
system
or
toxic
chemical
.

A
24-h
pretreatment
of
both
rats
and
mice
with
a
single
dose
of
CS

(
100mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
,
resulted
in
significant
protection
against
the
hepatotoxic
effects
of
CCl4
,
CHCl3
,
acetaminophen
and
galactosamine
and
against
the
lethal
(
and
presumably
cardiotoxic
)
effect
of
adriamycin
administration
.

Maximal
CS

-mediated
protection
was
observed
in
experimental
animals
pretreated
24
h
prior
to
the
toxic
insult
.

These
data
suggest
that
CS
intervenes
in
a
critical
cellular
event
that
is
an
important
common
pathway
to
toxic
cell
death
.

The
mechanism
of
CS
protection
does
not
appear
to
be
dependent
on
the
inhibition
of
chemical
bioactivation
to
a
toxic
reactive
intermediate
(
in
light
of
the
protection
observed
against
galactosamine
hepatotoxicity
)
.

However
,
based
on
the
data
presented
,
we
can
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
CS
administration
inhibits
chemical
bioactivation
.

Our
findings
do
suggest
that
CS
-mediated
protection
is
dependent
on
the
action
of
the
intact
anionic
CS
molecule
(
non
-
hydrolyzable
CSE
was
as
protective
as
CS
)
,
whose
mechanism
has
yet
to
be
defined
.

DSMM
XI
study
:
dose
definition
for
intravenous
cyclophosphamide
in
combination
with

bortezomib
/
dexamethasone
for
remission
induction
in
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
myeloma
.

A
clinical
trial
was
initiated
to
evaluate
the
recommended
dose
of
cyclophosphamide
in
combination
with
bortezomib
and
dexamethasone
as
induction
treatment
before
stem
cell
transplantation
for
younger
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
multiple
myeloma

(
MM
)
.

Thirty
patients
were
treated
with
three
21-day
cycles
of
bortezomib
1.3
mg
/
m(2
)
on
days
1
,
4
,
8
,
and
11
plus

dexamethasone
40
mg
on
the
day
of
bortezomib
injection
and
the
day
after
plus
cyclophosphamide
at
900
,
1,200
,
or
1,500
mg
/
m(2
)
on
day
1
.

The
maximum
tolerated
dose
of
cyclophosphamide
was
defined
as
900
mg
/
m(2
)
.

At
this
dose
level
,
92
%
of
patients
achieved
at
least
a
partial
response
.

The
overall
response
rate
[
complete
response
(
CR
)
plus
partial
response
(
PR
)
]
across
all
dose
levels
was
77
%
,
with
a
10
%
CR
rate
.

No
patient
experienced
progressive
disease
.

The
most
frequent
adverse
events
were
hematological
and
gastrointestinal
toxicities
as
well
as
neuropathy
.

The
results
suggest
that
bortezomib
in
combination
with
cyclophosphamide
at
900
mg
/
m(2
)
and
dexamethasone
is
an
effective
induction
treatment
for
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
MM
that
warrants
further
investigation
.

study
was
conducted
in

,
statistically
significant

were
observed
in
SBP
(

CONCLUSIONS
:

Among
these
Indian
patients
with
stage
II
hypertension
,
the
FDC
of
T+A
was
found
to
be
significantly
more
effective
,
with
regard
to
BP
reductions
,
than
A
,
and
both
treatments
were
well
tolerated
.

Cutaneous
leucocytoclastic
vasculitis
associated
with
oxacillin
.

A
67-year
-
old
man
who
was
treated
with
oxacillin
for
one
week
because
of
Staphylococcus
aureus
bacteremia
,
developed

renal
failure
and
diffuse
,
symmetric
,
palpable
purpuric
lesions
on
his
feet
.

Necrotic
blisters
were
noted
on
his
fingers
.

Skin
biopsies
showed
findings
diagnostic
of
leucocytoclastic
vasculitis
.

Oxacillin
was
discontinued
and
patient
was
treated
with
corticosteroids
.

The
rash
disappeared
after
three
weeks
and
renal
function
returned
to
normal
.

Leucocytoclastic
vasculitis
presents
as
palpable
purpura
of
the
lower
extremities
often
accompanied
by
abdominal
pain
,
arthralgia
,
and
renal
involvement
.

Etiologic
factors
or
associated
disorders
include
infections
,
medications
,
collagen
vascular
disease
and
neoplasia
.

However
,
in
half
of
the
cases
no
etiologic
factor
is
identified
.

Usually
it
is
a
self
-
limited
disorder
,
but
corticosteroid
therapy
may
be
needed
in
life
-
threatening
cases
since
early
treatment
with
corticosteroids
in
severe
cases
can
prevent
complications
.

Oxacillin
should
be
included
among
the
drugs
that
can
cause
leucocytoclastic
vasculitis
.

Naloxazone
pretreatment
modifies
cardiorespiratory
,
temperature
,
and
behavioral
effects
of
morphine
.

Behavioral
and
cardiorespiratory
responses
to
a
lethal
dose
of
morphine
were
evaluated
in
rats
pretreated
with
saline
or
naloxazone
,
an
antagonist
of
high
-
affinity
mu
1
opioid
receptors
.

Pretreatment
with
naloxazone
significantly
blocked

morphine
analgesia
,
catalepsy
and
hypothermia
at
a
dose
which
completely
eliminated
high
-
affinity
binding
in
brain
membranes
.

Moreover
,
naloxazone
significantly
attenuated
the
morphine
-induced
hypotension
and
respiratory
depression
,
whereas
morphine
-induced

bradycardia
was
less
affected
.

Results
indicate
that
subpopulations
of
mu
receptors
may
mediate
selective
behavioral
and
cardiorespiratory
responses
to
morphine
.

Dexrazoxane
protects
against
myelosuppression
from
the
DNA
cleavage
-
enhancing
drugs
etoposide
and
daunorubicin
but
not
doxorubicin
.

PURPOSE
:

The
anthracyclines

daunorubicin
and
doxorubicin
and
the
epipodophyllotoxin

etoposide
are
potent
DNA
cleavage
-
enhancing
drugs
that
are
widely
used
in
clinical
oncology
;
however
,
myelosuppression
and
cardiac
toxicity
limit
their
use
.

Dexrazoxane

(
ICRF-187
)
is
recommended
for
protection
against
anthracycline
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
:

Because
of
their
widespread
use
,
the
hematologic
toxicity
following
coadministration
of
dexrazoxane
and
these
three
structurally
different
DNA
cleavage
enhancers
was
investigated
:
Sensitivity
of
human
and
murine
blood
progenitor
cells
to
etoposide
,
daunorubicin
,
and
doxorubicin
+
/-

dexrazoxane
was
determined
in
granulocyte
-
macrophage
colony
forming
assays
.

Likewise
,
in
vivo
,
B6D2F1
mice
were
treated
with
etoposide
,
daunorubicin
,
and
doxorubicin
,
with
or
without
dexrazoxane
over
a
wide
range
of
doses
:
posttreatment
,
a
full
hematologic
evaluation
was
done
.

RESULTS
:

Nontoxic
doses
of
dexrazoxane
reduced

myelosuppression
and
weight
loss
from
daunorubicin
and
etoposide
in
mice
and
antagonized
their
antiproliferative
effects
in
the
colony
assay
;
however
,
dexrazoxane
neither
reduced

myelosuppression
,
weight
loss
,
nor
the
in
vitro
cytotoxicity
from
doxorubicin
.

CONCLUSION
:

Although
our
findings
support
the
observation
that
dexrazoxane
reduces
neither
hematologic
activity
nor
antitumor
activity
from
doxorubicin
clinically
,
the
potent
antagonism
of
daunorubicin
activity
raises
concern
;
a
possible
interference
with
anticancer
efficacy
certainly
would
call
for
renewed
attention
.

Our
data
also
suggest
that
significant
etoposide

dose
escalation
is
perhaps
possible
by
the
use
of
dexrazoxane
.

Clinical
trials
in
patients
with
brain
metastases
combining
dexrazoxane
and
high
doses
of
etoposide
is
ongoing
with
the
aim
of
improving
efficacy
without
aggravating
hematologic
toxicity
.

If
successful
,
this
represents
an
exciting
mechanism
for
pharmacologic
regulation
of
side
effects
from
cytotoxic
chemotherapy
.

Effects
of
the
novel
compound
aniracetam

(
Ro
13
-
5057
)
upon
impaired
learning
and
memory
in
rodents
.

The
effect
of
aniracetam

(
Ro
13
-
5057
,
1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone
)
was
studied
on
various
forms
of
experimentally
impaired
cognitive
functions
(
learning
and
memory
)
in
rodents
and
produced
the
following
effects
:
(

)
almost
complete
prevention
of
the
incapacity
to
learn
a
discrete
escape
response
in
rats
exposed
to
sublethal
hypercapnia
immediately
before
the
acquisition
session
;
(

)
partial
(
rats
)
or
complete
(
mice
)
prevention
of
the
scopolamine
-induced
short
-
term
amnesia
for
a
passive
avoidance
task
;
(

)
complete
protection
against
amnesia
for
a
passive
avoidance
task
in
rats
submitted
to
electroconvulsive
shock
immediately
after
avoidance
acquisition
;
(

)
prevention
of
the
long
-
term
retention-
or
retrieval
-
deficit
for
a
passive
avoidance
task
induced
in
rats
and
mice
by
chloramphenicol
or
cycloheximide
administered
immediately
after
acquisition
;
(
5
)
reversal
,
when
administered
as
late
as
1
h
before
the
retention
test
,
of
the
deficit
in
retention
or
retrieval
of
a
passive
avoidance
task
induced
by
cycloheximide
injected
2
days
previously
;
(
6
)
prevention
of
the
deficit
in
the
retrieval
of
an
active
avoidance
task
induced
in
mice
by
subconvulsant
electroshock
or
hypercapnia
applied
immediately
before
retrieval
testing
(
24
h
after
acquisition
)
.

These
improvements
or
normalizations
of
impaired
cognitive
functions
were
seen
at
oral
aniracetam
doses
of
10
-
100
mg
/
kg
.

Generally
,
the
dose
-
response
curves
were
bell
-
shaped
.

The
mechanisms
underlying
the
activity
of
aniracetam
and
its
'
therapeutic
window
'
are
unknown
.

Piracetam
,
another
pyrrolidinone
derivative
was
used
for
comparison
.

It
was
active
only
in
six
of
nine
tests
and
had
about
one
-
tenth
the
potency
of
aniracetam
.

The
results
indicate
that
aniracetam
improves
cognitive
functions
which
are
impaired
by
different
procedure
and
in
different
phases
of
the
learning
and
memory
process
.

Nicotine
potentiation
of
morphine

-induced

catalepsy
in
mice
.

In
the
present
study
,
effects
of
nicotine
on
catalepsy
induced
by
morphine
in
mice
have
been
investigated
.

Morphine
but
not
nicotine
induced
a
dose
-
dependent
catalepsy
.

The
response
of
morphine
was
potentiated
by
nicotine
.

Intraperitoneal
administration
of
atropine
,
naloxone
,
mecamylamine
,
and
hexamethonium
to
mice
reduced
catalepsy

induced
by
a
combination
of
morphine
with
nicotine
.

Intracerebroventricular
injection
of
atropine
,
hexamethonium
,
and
naloxone
also
decreased

catalepsy
induced
by
morphine
plus
nicotine
.

Intraperitoneal
administration
of
atropine
,
but
not
intraperitoneal
or
intracerebroventricular
injection
of
hexamethonium
,
decreased
the
effect
of
a
single
dose
of
morphine
.

It
was
concluded
that
morphine

catalepsy
can
be
elicited
by
opioid
and
cholinergic
receptors
,
and
the
potentiation
of
morphine
induced
by
nicotine
may
also
be
mediated
through
cholinergic
receptor
mechanisms
.

Reduced

.

PURPOSE
:

To
determine
whether
Myocet

(
liposome

encapsulated
doxorubicin
;
The
Liposome
Company
,
Elan
Corporation
,
Princeton

significantly
reduces
doxorubicin

cardiotoxicity
while
providing
comparable
antitumor
efficacy
in

cancer

(
MBC
)
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

Two
hundred
ninety
-
seven
patients
with
MBC

and
no
prior
chemotherapy
for
metastatic
disease
were
randomized
to
receive
either
60
mg
/
m(2
)
of
Myocet

(
M
)
or
conventional
doxorubicin
(
A
)
,
in
combination
with
600
mg
/
m(2
)
of
cyclophosphamide
(
C
)
,
every
3
weeks
until
disease
progression
or
unacceptable
toxicity
.

Cardiotoxicity
was
defined
by
reductions
in
left
-
ventricular
ejection
fraction
,
assessed
by
serial
multigated
radionuclide
angiography
scans
,
or
congestive
heart
failure

(

)
.

Antitumor
efficacy
was
assessed
by
objective
tumor
response
rates
(
World
Health
Organization
criteria
)
,
time
to
progression
,
and
survival
.

RESULTS
:

Six
percent
of
MC
patients
versus
21
%
(
including
five
cases
of
CHF
)
of
AC
patients
developed

cardiotoxicity
(
P
=
.0002
)
.

Median
cumulative
doxorubicin
dose
at
onset
was
more
than
2,220
mg

for
MC
versus
480
mg

m(2
)
for
AC
(
P

,
hazard
ratio
,
5.04
)
.

MC
patients
also
experienced
less
grade
4
neutropenia
.

Antitumor
efficacy
of
MC
versus
AC
was
comparable
:

objective
response
rates
,
43
%
versus
43
%
;
median
time

,
4.6
versus
4.4
months
;
and
median
survival
,
19
versus
16
months
.

CONCLUSION
:

Myocet
improves
the
therapeutic
index
of
doxorubicin
by
significantly
reducing
cardiotoxicity
and
grade
4
neutropenia
and
provides
comparable
antitumor

,
when
used
in

,
BN

,
on

.

Administration
of
the
local
anaesthetic
bupivacaine

(
1.5
or
2
mg
/
kg
,
i.v
.
)

to
rats
elicited
a
marked
decrease
of
mean
arterial
blood

(
MBP
)
and
heart

(
HR
)
leading
to
death
(
in
67

respectively
)
.

Intravenous

of
the

)
,
30
min
before
bupivacaine
administration
(
2
mg

)

suppressed
both
the
decrease
of

.

In
contrast
,
doses
of
1
mg
/

52021
given
30
min
before
or
10
mg
/
kg
administered
5
min
before
i.v
.

injection
of
bupivacaine
were
ineffective
.

When
BN
52021
(
20
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)
was
injected
immediately
after
bupivacaine

(
2
mg
/
kg
)
,

a
partial
reversion
of
the
decrease
of
MBP
and
HR
was
observed
,
whereas
the
dose
of
10
mg
/
kg
was
ineffective
.

A
partial
recovery
of
bupivacaine
-induced
ECG
alterations
was
observed
after
pretreatment
of
the
rats
with
BN
52021
.

Since
the
administration
of
BN
52021
,
at
all
doses
studied
,
did
not
alter
MBP
and
HR
at
the
doses
used
,
the
bulk
of
these
results
clearly
demonstrate
a
protective
action
of
BN
52021
,
a
specific
antagonist
of
PAF
,
against

bupivacaine
-induced

cardiovascular
toxicity
.

Thus
,
consistent
with
its
direct
effect
on
heart
,
PAF
appears
to
be
implicated
in
bupivacaine

-induced

cardiovascular
alterations
.

Benzylacyclouridine
reverses

azidothymidine
-induced

marrow
suppression
without
impairment
of
anti
-
human
immunodeficiency
virus
activity
.

Increased
extracellular
concentrations
of
uridine

(
Urd
)
have
been
reported
to
reduce
,
in
vitro
,
azidothymidine
(
AZT
)
-induced
inhibition
of
human
granulocyte
-
macrophage
progenitor
cells
without
impairment
of
its
antihuman
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
activity
.

Because
of
the
clinical
toxicities
associated
with
chronic
Urd
administration
,
the
ability
of
benzylacyclouridine

(
BAU
)
to
effect
,
in
vivo
,
AZT
-induced
anemia
and
leukopenia
was
assessed
.

This
agent
inhibits
Urd
catabolism
and
,
in
vivo
,
increases
the
plasma
concentration
of
Urd
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
without
Urd

-related

toxicity
.

In
mice
rendered

anemic
and
leukopenic
by
the
administration
of
AZT
for
28
days
in
drinking
water
(
1.5
mg
/
mL
)
,
the
continued
administration
of
AZT
plus

daily
BAU

(
300
mg
/
kg
,
orally
)
partially
reversed

AZT
-induced
anemia
and
leukopenia
(
P
less
than
.05
)
,
increased
peripheral
reticulocytes
(
to
4.9
%
,
P
less
than
.01
)
,
increased
cellularity
in
the
marrow
,
and
improved

megaloblastosis
.

When
coadministered
with
AZT
from
the
onset
of
drug
administration
,
BAU
reduced
AZT

-induced
marrow
toxicity
.

In
vitro
,
at
a
concentration
of
100
mumol
/
L
,
BAU
possesses
minimal
anti
-
HIV
activity
and
has
no
effect
on
the
ability
of
AZT
to
reverse
the
HIV
-
induced
cytopathic
effect
in
MT4
cells
.

The
clinical
and
biochemical
implications
of
these
findings
are
discussed

PURPOSE
:
To
develop

behavioral
approach
.

Cyclophosphamide

(
CP
)
,
an
antitumoral
agent
known
to
produce
toxic
effects
on
the
bladder
wall
through
its
main
toxic
metabolite
acrolein
,
was
used
to
induce
cystitis
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

CP
was
administered
at
doses
of
50
,
100
and
200
mg./kg
.

i.p
.

to
male
rats
,
and
their
behavior
observed
and
scored
.

The
effects
of
morphine

(
0.5
to
4
mg./kg
.
i.v
.
)
on

CP
-induced
behavioral
modifications
were
tested
administered
alone
and
after
naloxone

(
1
mg./kg

)
.

In
addition
,
90
minutes
after
CP
injection
,
that
is
,
at
the
time
of
administration
of
morphine
,
the
bladder
was
removed
in
some
rats
for
histological
examination
.

Finally
,
to
show
that
the
bladder
is
essential
for
the
CP
-induced
behavioral
modifications
,
female
rats
also
received
CP
at
doses
of
200
mg./kg
.

i.p

marked
behavioral
modifications
in
male
rats
:
breathing
rate
decrease
,
closing
of
the
eyes
and
occurrence
of
specific

.

Morphine

dose
-
dependently
reversed
these
behavioral
disorders
.

A
dose
of
0.5
mg./kg
.
produced
a
reduction
of
almost
50
%
of
the
behavioral
score
induced
by
CP
200
mg./kg
.

This
effect
was
completely
prevented
by
pretreatment
with
naloxone
.

At
the
time
of
administration
of
morphine
,
histological
modifications
of
the
bladder
wall
,
such
as
chorionic
and
muscle
layer
edema
,
were
observed
.

In
female
rats
,
CP

mg./kg
.
i.p
.
produced
the
same
marked
behavioral
modifications
as
those
observed
in
male
rats
.

Administered
at
the
dose
of
20
mg
.

intravesically
,
CP
did
not
produce
any
behavioral
effects
,
whereas

acrolein
at
0.5
mg
.

intravesically
induced
behavioral
modifications
identical
to
those
under
CP
200
mg./kg
.
i.p
.

,
with
the
same
maximal
levels
.

Conversely
,
acrolein
5
mg./kg
.
i.v
.

did
not
produce
any
behavioral
effects
at
all
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Overall
,
these
results
indicate
that
this
experimental
model
of
CP
-induced

cystitis
may
be
an
interesting
new
behavioral
model
of
inflammatory
visceral
pain
,
allowing
a
better
understanding
of
these
painful
syndromes
and
thus
a
better
therapeutic
approach
to
them
.

Hyperalgesia
and
myoclonus
in
terminal
cancer
patients
treated
with
continuous
intravenous
morphine
.

Eight

cancer
patients
in
the
terminal
stages
of
the
disease
treated
with
high
doses
of
intravenous
morphine
developed

hyperalgesia
.

All
cases
were
retrospectively
sampled
from
three
different
hospitals
in
Copenhagen
.

Five
patients
developed
universal
hyperalgesia
and
hyperesthesia
which
in
2
cases
were
accompanied
by
myoclonus
.

In
3
patients
a
pre
-
existing
neuralgia
increased
to
excruciating
intensity
and
in
2
of
these
cases
myoclonus
occurred
simultaneously
.

Although
only
few
clinical
descriptions
of
the
relationship
between
hyperalgesia
/
myoclonus
and
high
doses
of
morphine
are
available
,
experimental
support
from
animal
studies
indicates
that
morphine
,
or
its
metabolites
,
plays
a
causative
role
for
the
observed
behavioural
syndrome
.

The
possible
mechanisms
are
discussed
and
treatment
proposals
given
suggesting
the
use
of
more
efficacious
opioids
with
less
excitatory
potency
in
these
situations
.

A
prospective
study
of
adverse
reactions
associated
with
vancomycin
therapy
.

A
prospective
evaluation
of
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
vancomycin
was
conducted
in
54
consecutive
patients
over
a
16-month
period
.

Vancomycin
was
curative
in
95
%
of
43
patients
with
proven
infection
.

Drugs
were
ceased
in
six
patients
because
of
adverse
reactions
;
in
three
of
these
vancomycin
was
considered
the
likely
cause
.

Reactions
included

thrombophlebitis
(
20
of
54
patients
)
,
rash
(
4
of
54
)
,
nephrotoxicity

(
4
of
50
)
,
proteinuria
(
1
of
50
)
and
ototoxicity

(
1
of
11
patients
tested
by
audiometry
)
.

Thrombophlebitis
occurred
only
with
infusion
through
peripheral
cannulae
;
nephrotoxicity
and
ototoxicity
were
confined
to
patients
receiving
an
aminoglycoside
plus
vancomycin
.

We
conclude
that
vancomycin
,
administered
appropriately
,
constitutes
safe
,
effective
therapy
for
infections
caused
by
susceptible
bacteria
.

Blockade
of
both
D-1
and
D-2
dopamine
receptors
may
induce
catalepsy
in
mice
.

.

The
catalepsy
induced
by
dopamine
antagonists
has
been
tested
and
the
possible
dopamine
subtypes
involved
in
catalepsy
was
determined
.

.

Dopamine
antagonist
fluphenazine
,
D-1
antagonist
SCH

or
D-2
antagonist
sulpiride
induced
catalepsy
.

The
effect
of
fluphenazine
and
sulpiride
was
dose
-
dependent
.

Combination
of
SCH
23390
with
sulpiride
did
not
induce
catalepsy
potentiation
.

3
.
D-1
agonist

SKF
38393
or
D-2
agonist

quinpirole
decreased
the
catalepsy
induced
by
fluphenazine
,
SCH
23390
or
sulpiride
.

4
.

Combination
of
SKF
38393
with
quinpirole
did
not
cause
potentiated
inhibitory
effect
on
catalepsy
induced
by
dopamine
antagonists
.

5
.

The
data
may
indicate
that
although
D-2
receptor
blockade
is
involved
in
catalepsy
,
the
D-1
receptor
may
plan
a
role
.

Dextran
-
etodolac
conjugates
:
synthesis
,
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
evaluation
.

Etodolac
(
E
)
,
is
a
non
-
narcotic
analgesic
and
antiinflammatory
drug
.

A
biodegradable
polymer
dextran
has
been
utilized
as
a
carrier
for
synthesis
of
etodolac
-
dextran
conjugates
(
ED
)
to
improve
its
aqueous
solubility
and
reduce
gastrointestinal
side
effects
.

An
activated
moiety
,
i.e.
N
-
acylimidazole
derivative
of
etodolac

(
EAI
)
,
was
condensed
with
the
polysaccharide
polymer
dextran
of
different
molecular
weights
(
40000
,
60000
,
110000
and
200000
)
.

IR
spectral
data
confirmed
formation
of
ester
bonding
in
the
conjugates
.

Etodolac
contents
were
evaluated
by
UV
-
spectrophotometric
analysis
.

The
molecular
weights
were
determined
by
measuring
viscosity
using
the
Mark
-
Howink
-
Sakurada
equation
.

In
vitro
hydrolysis
of
ED
was
done
in
aqueous
buffers
(
pH
1.2
,
7.4
,
9
)
and
in
80
%
(
v
/
v
)
human
plasma
(
pH
7.4
)
.

At
pH
9
,
a
higher
rate
of
etodolac
release
from
ED
was
observed
as
compared
to
aqueous
buffer
of
pH
7.4
and
80
%
human
plasma
(
pH
7.4
)
,
following
first
-
order
kinetics
.

In
vivo
investigations
were
performed
in
animals
.

Acute
analgesic
and
antiinflammatory
activities
were
ascertained
using
acetic
acid
induced
writhing
model
(
mice
)
and
carrageenan
-induced
rat
paw
edema
model
,
respectively
.

In
comparison
to
control
,
E
and
ED1-ED4
showed
highly
significant
analgesic
and
antiinflammatory
activities
(
p
0.001
)
.

Biological
evaluation
suggested
that
conjugates
(
ED1-ED4
)
retained
comparable
analgesic
and
antiinflammatory
activities
with
remarkably
reduced
ulcerogenicity
as
compared
to
their
parent
drug--
etodolac
.

Hypersensitivity

myocarditis
complicating
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
heart
.

The
present
report
describes
a
case
of
eosinophilic
myocarditis
complicating
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
.

The
47-year
-
old
female
patient
,
known
to
have
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
,
was
admitted
with
biventricular
failure
and
managed
aggressively
with
dobutamine
infusion
and
other
drugs
while
being
assessed
for
heart
transplantation
.

On
transthoracic
echocardiogram
,
she
had
moderate
left
ventricular
dysfunction
with
regional
variability
and
moderate
mitral
regurgitation
.

The
recipient
's
heart
showed
the
features
of
apical
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
and
myocarditis
with
abundant
eosinophils
.

Myocarditis
is
rare
and
eosinophilic
myocarditis
is
rarer
.

It
is
likely
that
the
hypersensitivity

(
eosinophilic
)

myocarditis
was
related
to
dobutamine
infusion
therapy
.

Eosinophilic
myocarditis
has
been
reported
with
an
incidence
of
2.4
%
to
7.2
%
in
explanted
hearts
and
may
be
related
to
multidrug
therapy
.

All-
trans
-
retinoic
acid
-induced
erythema
nodosum
in
patients
with
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
.

Erythema
nodosum
associated
with
all-
trans
-
retinoic
acid

(
ATRA
)
for
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia

(
APL
)
is
very
rare
.

We
describe
four
patients
with
classic
APL
who
developed
erythema
nodosum
during
ATRA
therapy
.

Fever
and
subsequent
multiple
painful
erythematous
nodules
over
extremities
developed
on
D11
,
D16
,
D17
,
and
D19
,
respectively
,
after
ATRA
therapy
.

The
skin
biopsy
taken
from
each
patient
was
consistent
with
erythema
nodosum
.

All
patients
received
short
course
of
steroids
.

Fever
subsided
rapidly
and
the
skin
lesions
regressed
completely
.

All
patients
achieved
complete
remission
without
withdrawal
of
ATRA
.

ATRA
seemed
to
be
the
most
possible
etiology
of
erythema
nodosum
in
our
patients
.

Short
-
term
use
of
steroid
is
very
effective
in

ATRA
-induced

erythema
nodosum
.

Delayed
-
onset

heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
.

BACKGROUND
:

Heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
presents
5
to
12
days
after
heparin
exposure
,
with
or
without
arterial
or
venous
thromboemboli
.

Delayed
recognition
and
treatment
of

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
contribute
to
poor
patient
outcomes
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
and
increase
awareness
of
a
clinical
scenario
in
which
the
onset
or
manifestations
of
heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
are
delayed
.

DESIGN
:

Retrospective
case
series
.

SETTING
:

Three
large
urban
hospitals
(
with
active
cardiovascular
surgery
programs
)
.

PATIENTS
:
14
patients
seen
over
a
3-year
period
in
whom
heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
became
apparent
on
delayed
presentation
with
thromboembolic
complications
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
Platelet
counts
,
onset
of
objectively
determined
thromboembolism
,
results
of
heparin

-induced

platelet
factor
4
antibody
tests
,
and
outcomes
.

RESULTS
:

Patients
went
home
after
hospitalizations
that
had
included
heparin
exposure
--
in
most
cases
,
with
no
thrombocytopenia
recognized
--
only
to
return
to
the
hospital
(
median
,
day
14
)
with
thromboembolic
complications
.

Thromboemboli
were
venous
(
12
patients
,
7
with
pulmonary
emboli
)
or
arterial
(
4
patients
)
or
both
.

Platelet
counts
were
mildly
decreased
in
all
but
2
patients
on
second
presentation
.

On
readmission
,
11
patients
received
therapeutic
heparin
,
which
worsened
the
patients
'
clinical
condition
and
,
in
all
11
cases
,
decreased
the
platelet
count
(
mean
at
readmission
,
143
x
10(9
)
cells
/
L
;
mean
nadir
after
heparin
re
-
exposure
,
39
x
10(9
)
cells
/
L
)
.

Results
of
serologic
tests
for
heparin
-induced
antibodies
were
positive
in
all
patients
.

Subsequent
treatments
included
alternative
anticoagulants
(
11
patients
)
,
thrombolytic
drugs
(
3
patients
)
,
inferior
vena
cava
filters
(
3
patients
)
and
,
eventually
,
warfarin

(
11
patients
)
.

Three
patients
died
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Delayed
-
onset

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
is
increasingly
being
recognized
.

To
avoid
disastrous
outcomes
,
physicians
must
consider

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia

whenever
a
recently
hospitalized
patient
returns
with
thromboembolism
;
therapy
with
alternative
anticoagulants
,
not
heparin
,
should
be
initiated
.

Valsartan
,
a
new
angiotensin
II
antagonist
for
the
treatment
of
essential
hypertension
:
a
comparative
study
of
the
efficacy
and
safety
against
amlodipine
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
compare
the
antihypertensive
efficacy
of
a
new
angiotensin
II
antagonist
,
valsartan
,
with
a
reference
therapy
,
amlodipine
.

METHODS
:

One
hundred
sixty
-
eight
adult
outpatients
with
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
were
randomly
allocated
in
double
-
blind
fashion
and
equal
number
to
receive
80
mg
valsartan
or
5
mg
amlodipine
for
12
weeks
.

After
8
weeks
of
therapy
,
in
patients
whose
blood
pressure
remained
uncontrolled
,
5
mg
amlodipine
was
added
to
the
initial
therapy
.

Patients
were
assessed
at
4
,
8
,
and
12
weeks
.

The
primary
efficacy
variable
was
change
from
baseline
in
mean
sitting
diastolic
blood
pressure
at
8
weeks
.

Secondary
variables
included
change
in
sitting
systolic
blood
pressure
and
responder
rates
.

RESULTS
:

Both
valsartan
and
amlodipine
were
effective
at
lowering
blood
pressure
at
4
,
8
,
and
12
weeks
.

Similar
decreases
were
observed
in
both
groups
,
with
no
statistically
significant
differences
between
the
groups
for
any
variable
analyzed
.

For
the
primary
variable
the
difference
was
0.5
mm
Hg
in
favor
of
valsartan

(
p
=
0.68
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
-2.7
to
1.7
)
.

Responder
rates
at
8
weeks
were
66.7
%
for
valsartan
and
60.2
%
for
amlodipine

(
p
=
0.39
)
.

Both
treatments
were
well
tolerated
.

The
incidence
of
drug
-
related
dependent
edema
was
somewhat
higher
in
the
amlodipine
group
,
particularly
at
a
dose
of
10
mg
per
day
(
2.4
%
for
80
mg
valsartan
;
3.6
%
for
5
mg
amlodipine
;
0
%
for
valsartan
plus
5
mg
amlodipine
;
14.3
%
for
10
mg
amlodipine
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
data
show
that
valsartan
is
at
least
as
effective
as
amlodipine
in
the
treatment
of
mild
to
moderate
hypertension
.

The
results
also
show
valsartan
to
be
well
tolerated
and
suggest
that
it
is
not
associated
with
side
effects
characteristic
of
this
comparator
class
,
dihydropyridine
calcium
antagonists
.

KF17837
:
a
novel
selective
adenosine
A2A
receptor
antagonist
with
anticataleptic
activity
.

KF17837
is
a
novel
selective
adenosine
A2A
receptor
antagonist
.

Oral
administration
of
KF17837

(
2.5
,
10.0
and
30.0
mg
/
kg
)

significantly
ameliorated
the
cataleptic
responses
induced
by
intracerebroventricular
administration
of
an
adenosine
A2A
receptor
agonist
,
CGS
21680
(
10
micrograms
)
,
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

KF17837
also
reduced
the
catalepsy
induced
by
haloperidol

(
1
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

and
by
reserpine

(
5
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

These
anticataleptic
effects
were
exhibited
dose
dependently
at
doses
from
0.625
and
2.5
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
,
respectively
.

Moreover
,
KF17837

(
0.625
mg
/
kg
p.o
.
)

potentiated
the
anticataleptic
effects
of
a
subthreshold
dose
of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine

(
L
-
DOPA
;
25
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
plus
benserazide
(
6.25
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

These
results
suggested
that
KF17837
is
a
centrally
active
adenosine
A2A
receptor
antagonist
and
that
the
dopaminergic
function
of
the
nigrostriatal
pathway
is
potentiated
by
adenosine

A2A
receptor
antagonists
.

Furthermore
,
KF17837
may
be
a
useful
drug
in
the
treatment
of
parkinsonism
.

Some
central
effects
of
repeated
treatment
with
fluvoxamine
.

We
investigated
the
effect
of
repeated
treatment
with
fluvoxamine
,
a
selective
serotonin
uptake
inhibitor
,
on
behavioral
effects
of
dopaminomimetics
and
methoxamine
and
on
the
animal
behavior
in
the
"
behavioral
despair
"
test
.

A
repeated
treatment
with
fluvoxamine

(
twice
daily
for
14
days
)
potentiated
in
mice
and
in
rats
(
weaker
)
the
amphetamine
-induced
hyperactivity
.

The
hyperactivity
induced
by
nomifensine
in
mice
remained
unaffected
by
fluvoxamine
.

The
stimulation
of
locomotor
activity
by
intracerebroventricularly
administered
methoxamine
was
not
affected
by
repeated
treatment
with
fluvoxamine
.

Given
three
times
fluvoxamine
had
no
effect
on
the
immobilization
time
in
the
"
behavioral
despair
"
test
in
rats
.

The
results
indicate
that
fluvoxamine
given
repeatedly
acts
differently
than
citalopram
,
another
selective
serotonin
uptake
inhibitor
,
and
differs
also
from
other
antidepressant
drugs
.

Severe
congestive

failure
patient
on

amiodarone

presenting
with
myxedemic
coma
:
a
case
report
.

This
is
a
case
report
of
myxedema
coma
secondary
to
amiodarone
-induced
hypothyroidism
in
a
patient
with
severe
congestive
heart
failure

(
CHF
)
.

To
our
knowledge
and
after
reviewing
the
literature
there
is
one
case
report
of
myxedema
coma
during
long
term
amiodarone
therapy
.

Myxedema
coma
is
a
life
threatening
condition
that
carries
a
mortality
reaching
as
high
as
20
%
with
treatment
.

The
condition
is
treated
with
intravenous
thyroxine

(
T4
)
or
intravenous
tri
-
iodo
-
thyronine

(
T3
)
.

Patients
with
CHF
on
amiodarone
may
suffer
serious
morbidity
and
mortality
from
hypothyroidism
,
and
thus
may
deserve
closer
follow
up
for
thyroid
stimulating

(
TSH

This
case
report
carries
an
important
clinical
application
given
the
frequent
usage
of
amiodarone
among
CHF
patients
.

The
myriad
clinical
presentation
of
myxedema
coma
and
its
serious
morbidity
and
mortality
stresses
the
need
to
suspect
this
clinical
syndrome
among
CHF
patients
presenting
with
hypotension
,
weakness
or
other
unexplained
symptoms
.

Fear
-
potentiated
startle
,
but
not
light
-
enhanced
startle
,
is
enhanced
by
anxiogenic
drugs
.

RATIONALE
AND
OBJECTIVES
:

The
light
-
enhanced
startle
paradigm
(
LES
)
is
suggested
to
model
anxiety
,
because
of
the
non
-
specific
cue
and
the
long
-
term
effect
.

In
contrast
,
the
fear
-
potentiated
startle

(
FPS
)
is
suggested
to
model
conditioned
fear
.

However
,
the
pharmacological
profiles
of
these
two
paradigms
are
very
similar
.

The
present
study
investigated
the
effects
of
putative
anxiogenic
drugs
on
LES
and
FPS
and
aimed
at
determining
the
sensitivity
of
LES
for
anxiogenic
drugs
and
to
potentially
showing
a
pharmacological
differentiation
between
these
two
paradigms
.

METHODS
:

Male
Wistar
rats
received
each
dose
of
the
alpha(2)-adrenoceptor
antagonist
yohimbine
(
0.25
-
1.0mg
/
kg
)
,
the
5-HT
(

2C
)
receptor
agonist
m
-
chlorophenylpiperazine

(
mCPP
,
0.5
-
2.0mg
/
kg
)
or
the
GABA
(
A
)
inverse
receptor
agonist
pentylenetetrazole

(
PTZ
,
3
-
30mg
/
kg
)
and
were
subsequently
tested
in
either
LES
or
FPS
.

RESULTS
:

None
of
the
drugs
enhanced
LES
,
whereas
mCPP
increased
percentage
FPS
and

yohimbine
increased
absolute
FPS
values
.

Furthermore
,
yohimbine
increased
baseline
startle
amplitude
in
the
LES
,
while
mCPP
suppressed
baseline
startle
in
both
the
LES
and
FPS
and
PTZ
suppressed
baseline
startle
in
the
FPS
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
contrast
to
findings
in
the
FPS
paradigm
,
none
of
the
drugs
were
able
to
exacerbate
the
LES
response
.

Thus
,
a
clear
pharmacological
differentiation
was
found
between
LES
and
FPS
.

Proteinase
3-antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody-(PR3-ANCA
)
positive
necrotizing
glomerulonephritis
after
restarting
sulphasalazine
treatment
.

A
59-year
-
old
woman
with
ulcerative
colitis
developed

red
eyes
,
pleural
effusion
,
eosinophilia
and
urinary
abnormalities
after
restarting
of
sulphasalazine
treatment
.

Light
microscopy
of
a
kidney
biopsy
revealed
segmental
necrotizing
glomerulonephritis
without
deposition
of
immunoglobulin
or
complement
.

Proteinase
3-antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody
(
PR3-ANCA
)

titer
was
elevated
at
183
ELISA
units
(
EU
)
in
sera
(
normal
range
less
than
10
EU
)
,
myeloperoxidase
-
ANCA
was
negative
.

PR3-ANCA
titer
was
250
and
1,070
EU
in
pleural
effusions
on
right
and
left
side
,
respectively
.

Although
cessation
of
sulphasalazine
treatment
resulted
in
improvements
in
fever
,
red
eyes
,
chest
pain
,
titer
of
C
-
reactive
protein
and
volume
of
the
pleural
effusions
,
we
initiated
steroid
therapy
,
because
PR3-ANCA
titer
rose
to
320
EU
,
eosinophil
count
increased
to
1,100
cells
/
microl
,
and
the
pleural
effusion
remained
.

One
month
after
steroid
therapy
,
the
pleural
effusion
disappeared
,
and
PR3-ANCA
titer
normalized
3
months
later
.

This
case
suggests
that
sulphasalazine
can
induce
PR3-ANCA
-
positive
necrotizing
glomerulonephritis
.

Is
phenytoin
administration
safe
in
a
hypothermic
child
?

A
male
neonate
with
a
Chiari
malformation
and
a
leaking
myelomeningocoele
underwent
ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
insertion
followed
by
repair
of
myelomeningocoele
.

During
anaesthesia
and
surgery
,
he
inadvertently
became
moderately
hypothermic
.

Intravenous
phenytoin
was
administered
during
the
later
part
of
the
surgery
for
seizure
prophylaxis
.

Following
phenytoin
administration
,
the
patient
developed
acute
severe
bradycardia
,
refractory
to
atropine
and
adrenaline
.

The
cardiac
depressant
actions
of
phenytoin
and
hypothermia
can
be
additive
.

Administration
of
phenytoin
in
the
presence
of
hypothermia
may
lead
to
an
adverse
cardiac
event
in
children
.

As
phenytoin
is
a
commonly
used
drug
,
clinicians
need
to
be
aware
of
this
interaction
.

Amisulpride
related

tic
-
like
symptoms
in
an
adolescent
schizophrenic
.

Tic
disorders
can
be
effectively
treated
by
atypical
antipsychotics
such
as
risperidone
,
olanzapine
and
ziprasidone
.

However
,
there
are
two
case
reports
that
show
tic
-
like
symptoms
,
including
motor
and
phonic
variants
,
occurring
during
treatment
with
quetiapine
or
clozapine
.

We
present
a
15-year
-
old
girl
schizophrenic
who
developed
frequent
involuntary
eye
-
blinking
movements
after
5
months
of
amisulpride
treatment
(
1000
mg
per
day
)
.

The
tic
-
like
symptoms
resolved
completely
after
we
reduced
the
dose
of
amisulpride
down
to
800
mg
per
day
.

However
,
her
psychosis
recurred
after
the
dose
reduction
.

We
then
placed
her
on
an
additional
100
mg
per
day
of
quetiapine
.

She
has
been
in
complete
remission
under
the
combined
medications
for
more
than
one
year
and
maintains
a
fair
role
function
.

No
more

tic
-
like
symptoms
or
other
side
effects
have
been
reported
.

Together
with
previously
reported
cases
,
our
patient
suggests
that
tic
-
like
symptoms
might
occur
in
certain
vulnerable
individuals
during
treatment
with
atypical
antipsychotics
such
as
quetiapine
,
clozapine
,
or
amisulpride
.

Comparison
of
developmental
toxicology
of
aspirin

(
acetylsalicylic
acid
)
in
rats
using
selected
dosing
paradigms
.

BACKGROUND
:

Analysis
of
the
literature
for
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
suggests
that
a
low
incidence
of
developmental
anomalies
occurs
in
rats
given
NSAIDs
on
specific
days
during
organogenesis
.

Aspirin

(
acetylsalicylic
acid
[
ASA
]
)
,
an
irreversible
cyclooxygenase
1
and
2
inhibitor
,
induces
developmental
anomalies
when
administered
to
Wistar
rats
on
gestational
day
(
GD
)

9
,
10
,
or
11
(

Teratology
4:15
-

,

)
.

There
are
no
published
ASA
studies
using
the
multiple
dosing
paradigm
of
GDs
6
to
17
.

Objectives
of
the
current
study
were
to
compare
results
between
Sprague
-
Dawley
(
SD
)
and
Wistar
strains
when
ASA
is
administered
on
GD
9
,
10
,
or
11
;
to
compare
the
malformation
patterns
following
single
and
multiple
dosings
during
organogenesis
in
SD
rats
;
and
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
maternal
gastrointestinal
toxicity
confounds
the
detection
of
low
incidence
malformations
with
ASA
when
a
multiple
dosing
paradigm
is
used
.

METHODS
:

ASA
was
administered
as
a
single
dose
on
GD
9
(
0
,
250
,
500
,
or
625
mg
/
kg
)
,
10
(
0
,
500
,
625
,
or
750
mg
/
kg
)
,
or
11
(
0
,
500
,
750
,
or
1000
mg
/
kg
)
and
from
GD
6
to
GD
17
(
0
,
50
,
125
,
or
250
mg
/
kg
a
day
)

in
the
multiple
dose
study
to
SD
rats
.

Animals
were
killed
on
GD
21
,
and
fetuses
were
examined
viscerally
.

RESULTS
:

The
literature
evaluation
suggested
that
NSAIDs
induce
ventricular
septal
defects

(
VSDs
)
and
midline
defects

(
MDs
)
in
rats
and
diaphragmatic
hernia

(
DH
)
,
MDs
,
and
VSDs
in
rabbits
(
Cook
JC
et
al
.
,
2003
)
;
hence
,
the
present
study
focused
on
these
malformations
,
even
though
ASA
induces
several
other
low
-
incidence
malformations
.

In
single
dose
studies
,
DH
,
MD
,
and
VSD
were
induced
on
GDs
9
and
10
.

VSD
also
was
noted
following
treatment
on
GD
11
.

In
contrast
,
DH
and
MD
were
noted
in
the
multiple
dose
study
design
only
in
the
high
-
dose
group
,
and
VSD
was
noted
across
all
dose
groups
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

High
concordance
in
major
developmental
anomalies
between
Wistar
and
SD
rats
were
noted
with
the
exception
of
VSD
in
the
SD
rats
and
hydrocephalus
in
the
Wistar
rats
.

Variations
and
malformations
were
similar
when
ASA
was
administered
as
a
single
dose
or
during
the
period
of
organogenesis
(
GDs
6
to
17
)
.

It
was
also
evident
that
,
by
titrating
the
dose
to
achieve
a
maximum
tolerated
dose
,
malformations
that
normally
occur
at
low
incidence
,
as
reported
from
previous
single
dose
studies
,
could
also
be
induced
with
ASA
given
at
multiple
doses
.

Torsade
de
pointes
induced
by
metoclopramide
in
an
elderly
woman
with
preexisting
complete
left
bundle
branch
block
.

There
is
a
growing
list
of
drugs
implicated
in
acquired
long
QT
syndrome
and
torsade
de
pointes
.

However
,
the
torsadogenic
potential
of
metoclopramide
,
a
commonly
used
antiemetic
and
prokinetic
drug
,
has
not
been
reported
in
the
literature
,
despite
its
chemical
similarity
to
procainamide
.

We
report
on
a
92-year
-
old
woman
with
preexisting
complete
left
bundle
branch
block
who
developed
torsade
de
pointes
after
intravenous
and
oral
administration
of
metoclopramide
.

This
patient
also
developed
torsade
de
pointes
when
cisapride
and
erythromycin
were
given
simultaneously
.

These
two
episodes
were
suppressed
successfully
after
discontinuing
the
offending
drugs
and
administering
class
IB
drugs
.

This
is
the
first
documentation
that
metoclopramide
provokes
torsade
de
pointes
clinically
.

Metoclopramide
should
be
used
cautiously
in
patients
with
a
risk
of
torsade
de
pointes
.

Apomorphine
:
an
underutilized
therapy
for
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Apomorphine
was
the
first
dopaminergic
drug
ever
used
to
treat
symptoms
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

While
powerful
antiparkinsonian
effects
had
been
observed
as
early
as
1951
,
the
potential
of
treating
fluctuating
Parkinson
's
disease
by
subcutaneous
administration
of
apomorphine
has
only
recently
become
the
subject
of
systematic
study
.

A
number
of
small
scale
clinical
trials
have
unequivocally
shown
that
intermittent
subcutaneous
apomorphine
injections
produce
antiparkinsonian
benefit
close
if
not
identical
to
that
seen
with
levodopa
and
that
apomorphine
rescue
injections
can
reliably
revert
off
-
periods
even
in
patients
with
complex
on
-
off
motor
swings
.

Continuous
subcutaneous
apomorphine
infusions
can
reduce
daily
off
-
time
by
more
than
50
%
in
this
group
of
patients
,
which
appears
to
be
a
stronger
effect
than
that
generally
seen
with
add
-
on
therapy
with
oral
dopamine
agonists
or
COMT
inhibitors
.

Extended
follow
-
up
studies
of
up
to
8
years
have
demonstrated
long
-
term
persistence
of
apomorphine
efficacy
.

In
addition
,
there
is
convincing
clinical
evidence
that
monotherapy
with
continuous
subcutaneous
apomorphine
infusions
is
associated
with
marked
reductions
of
preexisting
levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias
.

The
main
side
effects
of
subcutaneous
apomorphine
treatment
are
related
to
cutaneous
tolerability
problems
,
whereas
sedation
and
psychiatric
complications
play
a
lesser
role
.

Given
the
marked
degree
of
efficacy
of
subcutaneous
apomorphine
treatment
in
fluctuating
Parkinson
's
disease
,
this
approach
seems
to
deserve
more
widespread
clinical
use
.

Fatal
excited

delirium
following
cocaine
use
:
epidemiologic
findings
provide
new
evidence
for
mechanisms
of
cocaine
toxicity
.

We
describe
an
outbreak
of
deaths
from
cocaine
-induced
excited
delirium

(
EDDs
)
in
Dade
County
,
Florida
between
1979
and
1990
.

From
a
registry
of
all
cocaine
-related
deaths
in
Dade
County
,
Florida
,
from
1969
-
1990
,
58
EDDs
were
compared
with
125
victims
of
accidental
cocaine

overdose
without
excited
delirium
.

Compared
with
controls
,
EDDs
were
more
frequently
black
,
male
,
and
younger
.

They
were
less
likely
to
have
a
low
body
mass
index
,
and
more
likely
to
have
died
in
police
custody
,
to
have
received
medical
treatment
immediately
before
death
,
to
have
survived
for
a
longer
period
,
to
have
developed
hyperthermia
,
and
to
have
died
in
summer
months
.

EDDs
had
concentrations
of
cocaine
and
benzoylecgonine
in
autopsy
blood
that
were
similar
to
those
for
controls
.

The
epidemiologic
findings
are
most
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
chronic
cocaine
use
disrupts
dopaminergic
function
and
,
when
coupled
with
recent
cocaine
use
,
may
precipitate
agitation
,
delirium
,
aberrant
thermoregulation
,
rhabdomyolysis
,
and
sudden
death
.

Heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
,
thrombosis
,
and
hemorrhage
.

Sixty
-
two
patients
with
a
heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
are
reported
.

Clinical
manifestations
of
this
disorder
include
hemorrhage
or
,
more
frequently
,
thromboembolic
events
in
patients
receiving
heparin
.

Laboratory
testing
has
revealed
a
falling
platelet
count
,
increased
resistance
to
heparin
,
and
aggregation
of
platelets
by
the
patient
's
plasma
when
heparin
is
added
.

Immunologic
testing
has
demonstrated
the
presence
of
a
heparin
-dependent
platelet
membrane
antibody
.

The
20
deaths
,
52
hemorrhagic
and
thromboembolic
complications
,
and
21
surgical
procedures
to
manage
the
complications
confirm
the
seriousness
of
the
disorder
.

Specific
risk
factors
have
not
been
identified
;
therefore
,
all
patients
receiving
heparin
should
be
monitored
.

If
the
platelet
count
falls
to
less
than
100,000/mm3
,
while
the
patient
is
receiving
heparin
,
platelet
aggregation
testing
,
using
the
patient
's
plasma
,
is
indicated
.

Management
consists
of
cessation
of
heparin
,
platelet
anti
-
aggregating
agents
,
and
alternate
forms
of
anticoagulation
when
indicated
.

Cardiac
toxicity
of
5-fluorouracil
.

Report
of
a
case
of
spontaneous
angina
.

We
report
a
case
of
a
patient
with
colon
carcinoma
and
liver
metastasis
who
presented
chest
pain
after
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
administration
.

Clinical
electrocardiographic
evolution
was
similar
to
that
observed
in
Prinzmetal
's
angina
,
and
chest
pain
promptly
resolved
with
nifedipine
.

These
data
suggest
that
coronary
spasm
may
be
the
cause
of
cardiotoxicity
due
to
5-FU
,
and
that
calcium
antagonists
may
probably
be
used
in
the
prevention
or
treatment
of
5-FU
cardiotoxicity
.

Toxicity
due
to
remission
inducing
drugs
in
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Association
with
HLA
-
B35
and
Cw4
antigens
.

Twenty
-
five
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis

(
RA
)
who
developed
toxicity
while
taking
remission
inducing
drugs
and
30
without
toxicity
were
studied
for
possible
associations
with
class
I
and
II
HLA
antigens
.

A
strong
association
has
been
found
between
nephritis
and
dermatitis
due
to
Tiopronin
(
a
D
-
Penicillamine
like
compound
)
and
class
I
antigens
B35-Cw4
,
and
between
dermatitis
due
to
gold
thiosulphate
and
B35
.

Compared
to
healthy
controls
a
lower
DR5
frequency
was
observed
in
patients
with
RA
except
for
the
Tiopronin
related
nephritis
group
.

Transient
hemiparesis
:
a
rare
manifestation
of
diphenylhydantoin
toxicity
.

Report
of
two
cases
.

Among
the
common
side
effects
of
diphenylhydantoin

(
DPH
)

overdose
,
the
most
frequently
encountered
neurological
signs
are
those
of
cerebellar
dysfunction
.

Very
rarely
,
the
toxic
neurological
manifestations
of
this
drug
are
of
cerebral
origin
.

Two
patients
are
presented
who
suffered
progressive
hemiparesis
due
to
DPH
overdose
.

Both
had
brain
surgery
before
DPH
treatment
.

It
is
assumed
that
patients
with
some
cerebral
damage
are
liable
to
manifest
DPH

toxicity
as
focal
neurological
signs
.

Nerve
growth
factor
and
prostaglandins
in
the
urine
of
female
patients
with
overactive
bladder
.

PURPOSE
:

NGF
and
PGs
in
the
bladder
can
be
affected
by
pathological
changes
in
the
bladder
and
these
changes
can
be
detected
in
urine
.

We
investigated
changes
in
urinary
NGF
and
PGs
in
women
with
OAB
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

The
study
groups
included
65
women
with
OAB
and
20
without
bladder
symptoms
who
served
as
controls
.

Evaluation
included
patient
history
,
urinalysis
,
a
voiding
diary
and
urodynamic
studies
.

Urine
samples
were
collected
.

NGF
,
PGE2
,
PGF2alpha
and
PGI2
were
measured
using
enzyme
-
linked
immunosorbent
assay
and
compared
between
the
groups
.

In
addition
,
correlations
between
urinary
NGF
and
PG
,
and
urodynamic
parameters
in
patients
with
OAB
were
examined
.

RESULTS
:

Urinary
NGF
,
PGE2
and
PGF2alpha
were
significantly
increased
in
patients
with
OAB
compared
with
controls
(
p
0.05
)
.

However
,
urinary
PGI2
was
not
different
between
controls
and
patients
with
OAB
.

In
patients
with
OAB
urinary
PGE2
positively
correlated
with
volume
at
first
desire
to
void
and
maximum
cystometric
capacity
(
p
0.05
)
.

Urinary
NGF
,
PGF2alpha
and
PGI2
did
not
correlate
with
urodynamic
parameters
in
patients
with
OAB
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

NGF
and
PGs
have
important
roles
in
the
development
of
OAB
symptoms
in
female
patients
.

Urinary
levels
of
these
factors
may
be
used
as
markers
to
evaluate
OAB
symptoms
.

Acute
low
back
pain
during
intravenous
administration
of
amiodarone
:
a
report
of
two
cases
.

Amiodarone
represents
an
effective
antiarrhythmic
drug
for
cardioversion
of
recent
-
onset
atrial
fibrillation

(
AF
)
and
maintenance
of
sinus
rhythm
.

We
briefly
describe
two
patients
suffering
from
recent
-
onset
atrial
fibrillation
,
who
experienced
an
acute
devastating
low
back
pain
a
few
minutes
after
initiation
of
intravenous
amiodarone
loading
.

Notably
,
this
side
effect
has
not
been
ever
reported
in
the
medical
literature
.

Clinicians
should
be
aware
of
this
reaction
since
prompt
termination
of
parenteral
administration
leads
to
complete
resolution
.

Postoperative
myalgia
after
succinylcholine
:
no
evidence
for
an
inflammatory
origin
.

A
common
side
effect
associated
with
succinylcholine
is
postoperative
myalgia
.

The
pathogenesis
of
this
myalgia
is
still
unclear
;
inflammation
has
been
suggested
but
without
convincing
evidence
.

We
designed
the
present
study
to
investigate
whether
an
inflammatory
reaction
contributes
to
this
myalgia
.

The
incidence
and
severity
of
succinylcholine
-associated
myalgia
was
determined
in
64
patients
pretreated
with
saline
or
dexamethasone
before
succinylcholine

(
n
=
32
for
each
)
.

Incidence
and
severity
of
myalgia
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
two
groups
:
15
patients
in
the
dexamethasone
group
complained
of
myalgia
compared
with
18
patients
in
the
saline
group
,
and
severe
myalgia
was
reported
by
five
patients
and
three
patients
,
respectively
(
not
significant
)
.

At
48
h
after
surgery
,
12
patients
in
both
groups
still
suffered
from
myalgia

(
not
significant
)
.

In
addition
,
interleukin-6
(
IL-6
)
as
an
early
marker
of
inflammation
was
assessed
in
a
subgroup
of
10
patients
pretreated
with
saline
.

We
found
an
increase
of
IL-6
for
only
three
patients
,
but
only
one
patient
reported
myalgia
;
no
relationship
between
myalgia
and
the
increase
of
IL-6
was
found
.

In
conclusion
,
there
is
no
evidence
for
an
inflammatory
origin
of
succinylcholine
-associated
myalgia
.

IMPLICATIONS
:

Administration
of
dexamethasone
before
succinylcholine
was
not
effective
in
decreasing
the
incidence
or
the
severity
of
succinylcholine

-induced

postoperative
myalgia
.

Furthermore
,
there
was
no
significant
relationship
between
postoperative
myalgia
and
time
course
of
interleukin-6
concentrations
,
a
marker
of
inflammation
.

Pretreatment
with
dexamethasone
is
not
justified
to
prevent
postoperative
myalgia
after
succinylcholine
.

Levodopa
-induced
oromandibular
dystonia
in
progressive
supranuclear
palsy
.

Levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias
have
been
reported
in
Parkinson
's
disease
and
multiple
system
atrophy
.

Cranial
dystonias
are
rare
in
patients
with
progressive
supranuclear
palsy

(
PSP
)
.

In
this
report
we
describe
an
unusual
case
of
reversible
levodopa
-induced
Oromandibular
dystonia

(
OMD
)
in
a
PSP
patient
to
highlight
the
importance
of
recognizing
this
drug
related
complication
in
the
management
of
PSP
,
and
discuss
the
possible
underlying
pathophysiology
.

Protective
effect
of
edaravone
against
streptomycin
-induced
vestibulotoxicity
in
the
guinea
pig
.

This
study
investigated
alleviation
of
streptomycin
-induced

vestibulotoxicity
by
edaravone
in
guinea
pigs
.

Edaravone
,
a
free
radical
scavenger
,
has
potent
free
radical
quenching
action
and
is
used
in
clinical
practice
to
treat
cerebral
infarction
.

Streptomycin
was
administered
to
the
inner
ear
by
osmotic
pump
for
24
h
,
and
edaravone
(
n=8
)
or
saline
(
n=6
)
was
intraperitoneally
injected
once
a
day
for
7
days
.

We
observed
horizontal
vestibulo
-
ocular
reflex
as
a
marker
of
postoperative
vestibular
function
.

Animals
injected
with
saline
showed
statistically
smaller
gains
than
those
injected
with
edaravone
.

These
results
suggest
that
edaravone
suppresses

streptomycin
-induced

vestibulotoxicity
.

Ketamine
in
war
/
tropical
surgery
(
a
final
tribute
to
the
racemic
mixture
)
.

A
technique
of
continuous
intravenous
anaesthesia
with
ketamine
was
used
successfully
during
the
Somalia
civil
war
in
1994
and
in
north
Uganda
in
1999
for
64
operations
in
62
patients
,
aged
from
6
weeks
to
70
years
,
undergoing
limb
and
abdominal
surgery
including
caesarian
sections
and
interventions
in
neonates
.

Operations
lasting
up
to
2h
could
be
performed
in
the
absence
of
sophisticated
equipment
such
as
pulse
oximeters
or
ventilators
in
patients
on
spontaneous
ventilation
breathing
air/
oxygen
only
.

After
premedication
with
diazepam
,
glycopyrrolate
and
local
anaesthesia
,
and
induction
with
standard
doses
of
ketamine
,
a
maintenance
dose
of
10
-
20
microg
/
kg
/
min
of
ketamine
proved
safe
and
effective
.

Emphasis
was
placed
on
bedside
clinical
monitoring
,
relying
heavily
on
the
heart
rate
.

Diazepam
,
unless
contraindicated
or
risky
,
remains
the
only
necessary
complementary
drug
to
ketamine
as
it
buffers
its
cardiovascular
response
and
decreases
the
duration
and
intensity
of
operative
and
postoperative
hallucinations
.

Local
anaesthetic
blocks
were
useful
in
decreasing
the
requirement
for
postoperative
analgesia
.

An
antisialogue
was
usually
unnecessary
in
operations
lasting
up
to
2
h
,
glycopyrrolate
being
the
best
choice
for
its
lowest
psychotropic
and
chronotropic
effects
,
especially
in
a
hot
climate
.

Experience
in
war
/
tropical
settings
suggests
this
technique
could
be
useful
in
civilian
contexts
such
as
outdoor
life
-
saving
emergency
surgery
or
in
mass
casualties
where
,
e.g.
amputation
and
rapid
extrication
were
required
.

Steroid
structure
and
pharmacological
properties
determine
the
anti-
amnesic
effects
of
pregnenolone
sulphate
in
the
passive
avoidance
task
in
rats
.

Pregnenolone
sulphate

(
PREGS
)
has
generated
interest
as
one
of
the
most
potent
memory
-
enhancing
neurosteroids
to
be
examined
in
rodent
learning
studies
,
with
particular
importance
in
the
ageing
process
.

The
mechanism
by
which
this
endogenous
steroid
enhances
memory
formation
is
hypothesized
to
involve
actions
on
glutamatergic
and
GABAergic
systems
.

This
hypothesis
stems
from
findings
that
PREGS
is
a
potent
positive
modulator
of
N
-
methyl
-
d
-
aspartate
receptors
(
NMDARs
)
and
a
negative
modulator
of
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
(
A
)
receptors
(
GABA
(
A)Rs
)
.

Moreover
,
PREGS
is
able
to
reverse
the
amnesic
-like
effects
of
NMDAR
and
GABA
(
A)R
ligands
.

To
investigate
this
hypothesis
,
the
present
study
in
rats
examined
the
memory
-
altering
abilities
of
structural
analogs
of
PREGS
,
which
differ
in
their
modulation
of
NMDAR
and/or
GABA

(
A)R
function
.

The
analogs
tested
were
:
11-ketopregnenolone
sulphate

(
an
agent
that
is
inactive
at
GABA

(
A)Rs
and
NMDARs
)
,
epipregnanolone
(
[
3beta
-
hydroxy-5beta
-
pregnan-20-one
]
sulphate
,
an
inhibitor
of
both
GABA
(
A)Rs
and
NMDARs
)
,
and
a
newly
synthesized
(
-
)
PREGS
enantiomer
(
which
is
identical
to
PREGS
in
effects
on
GABA

(
A)Rs
and
NMDARs
)
.

The
memory
-
enhancing
effects
of
PREGS
and
its
analogs
were
tested
in
the
passive
avoidance
task
using
the
model
of
scopolamine

-induced
amnesia
.

Both
PREGS
and
its
(
-
)
enantiomer
blocked
the
effects
of
scopolamine
.

The
results
show
that
,
unlike
PREGS
,
11-ketopregnenolone
sulphate
and
epipregnanolone
sulphate
failed
to
block
the
effect
of
scopolamine
,
suggesting
that
altering
the
modulation
of
NMDA
receptors
diminishes
the
memory
-
enhancing
effects
of
PREGS
.

Moreover
,
enantioselectivity
was
demonstrated
by
the
ability
of
natural
PREGS
to
be
an
order
of
magnitude
more
effective
than
its
synthetic
enantiomer
in
reversing
scopolamine

-induced
amnesia
.

These
results
identify
a
novel
neuropharmacological
site
for
the
modulation
of
memory
processes
by
neuroactive
steroids
.

Preliminary
efficacy
assessment
of
intrathecal
injection
of
an
American
formulation
of
adenosine
in
humans
.

BACKGROUND
:

Preclinical
studies
of
intrathecal
adenosine
suggest
it
may
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
acute
and
chronic
pain
in
humans
,
and
preliminary
studies
in
volunteers
and
patients
with
a
Swedish
formulation
of
adenosine
suggests
it
may
be
effective
in
hypersensitivity
states
but
not
with
acute
noxious
stimulation
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
screen
for
efficacy
of
a
different
formulation
of
adenosine
marketed
in
the
US
,
using
both
acute
noxious
stimulation
and
capsaicin
-evoked
mechanical
hypersensitivity
.

METHODS
:

Following
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
institutional
review
board
approval
and
written
informed
consent
,
65
volunteers
were
studied
in
two
trials
:
an
open
-
label
,
dose
-
escalating
trial
with
intrathecal
adenosine
doses
of
0.25
-
2.0
mg
and
a
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
trial
of
adenosine
,
2
mg
.

Cerebrospinal
fluid
was
obtained
for
pharmacokinetic
analysis
,
and
pain
ratings
in
response
to
acute
heat
stimuli
and
areas
of
mechanical
hyperalgesia
and
allodynia
after
intradermal
capsaicin
injection
were
determined
.

RESULTS
:

Adenosine
produced
no
effect
on
pain
report
to
acute
noxious
thermal
or
chemical
stimulation
but
reduced
mechanical
hyperalgesia
and
allodynia
from
intradermal
capsaicin
injection
for
at
least
24
h.

In
contrast
,
residence
time
of
adenosine
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
was
short
(
4
h
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
results
show
selective
inhibition
by
intrathecal
adenosine
of
hypersensitivity
,
presumed
to
reflect
central
sensitization
in
humans
after
peripheral
capsaicin
injection
.

The
long
-
lasting
effect
is
consistent
with
that
observed
in
preliminary
reports
of
patients
with
chronic
neuropathic
pain
and
is
not
due
to
prolonged
residence
of
adenosine
in
cerebrospinal
fluid
.

Effect
of
lithium
maintenance
therapy
on
thyroid
and
parathyroid
function
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
assess
changes
induced
by
lithium
maintenance
therapy
on
the
incidence
of
thyroid
,
parathyroid
and
ion
alterations
.

These
were
evaluated
with
respect
to
the
duration
of
lithium
therapy
,
age
,
sex
,
and
family
history
(
whether
or
not
the
patient
had
a
first
-
degree
relative
with
thyroid
disease
)
.

DESIGN
:
Prospective
study
.

SETTING
:

Affective
Disorders
Clinic
at
St.
Mary
's
Hospital
,
Montreal
.

PATIENTS
:

One
hundred
and
one
patients
(
28
men
and
73
women
)
with
bipolar
disorder
receiving
lithium
maintenance
therapy
ranging
from
1
year
's
to
32
years
'
duration
.

The
control
group
consisted
of
82
patients
with
no
psychiatric
or
endocrinological
diagnoses
from
the
hospital
's
out
-
patient
clinics
.

OUTCOME
MEASURES
:

Laboratory
analyses
of
calcium
,
magnesium
and
thyroid
-
stimulating
hormone
levels
performed
before
beginning
lithium
therapy
and
at
biannual
follow
-
up
.

RESULTS
:

Hypothyroidism
developed
in
40
patients
,
excluding
8
patients
who
were
hypothyroid
at
baseline
.

All
patients
having
first
-
degree
relatives
affected
by

thyroid
illness
had
accelerated
onset
of
hypothyroidism

(
3.7
years
after
onset
of
lithium
therapy
)
compared
with
patients
without
a
family
history
(
8.6
years
after
onset
of
lithium
therapy
)
.

Women
over
60
years
of
age
were
more
often
affected
by
hypothyroidism
than
women
under
60
years
of
age
(
34.6
%
versus
31.9
%
)
.

Magnesium
levels
in
patients
on
lithium
treatment
were
unchanged
from
baseline
levels
.

After
lithium
treatment
,
calcium
levels
were
higher
than
either
baseline
levels
or
control
levels
.

Thus
,
lithium
treatment
counteracted
the
decrease
in
plasma
calcium
levels
associated
with
aging
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Familial
thyroid
illness
is
a
risk
factor
for
hypothyroidism
and
hypercalcemia
during
lithium
therapy
.

Systemic
toxicity
following
administration
of
sirolimus
(
formerly
rapamycin
)
for
psoriasis
:
association
of
capillary
leak
syndrome
with
apoptosis
of
lesional
lymphocytes
.

BACKGROUND
:

Sirolimus
(
formerly
rapamycin
)
is
an
immunosuppressive
agent
that
interferes
with
T
-
cell
activation
.

After
2
individuals
with
psoriasis
developed
a
capillary
leak
syndrome
following
treatment
with
oral
sirolimus

lesional
skin
cells
and
activated
peripheral
blood
cells
were
analyzed
for
induction
of
apoptosis
.

OBSERVATIONS
:

A
keratome
skin
specimen
from
1
patient
with
sirolimus
-induced

capillary
leak
syndrome
had
a
2.3-fold
increase
in
percentage
of
apoptotic
cells
(
to
48
%
)
compared
with
an
unaffected
sirolimus
-treated
patient
with
psoriasis

(
21
%
)
.

Activated
peripheral
blood
T
cells
from
patients
with
psoriasis
tended
to
exhibit
greater
spontaneous
or
dexamethasone
-induced
apoptosis
than
did
normal
T
cells
,
particularly
in
the
presence
of
sirolimus
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Severe
adverse
effects
of
sirolimus
include
fever
,
anemia
,
and
capillary
leak
syndrome
.

These
symptoms
may
be
the
result
of
drug
-
induced
apoptosis
of
lesional
leukocytes
,
especially
activated
T
lymphocytes
,
and
possibly
release
of
inflammatory
mediators
.

Because
patients
with
severe
psoriasis
may
develop
capillary
leak
from
various
systemic
therapies
,
clinical
monitoring
is
advisable
for
patients
with
inflammatory
diseases
who
are
treated
with
immune
modulators
.

Contribution
of
the
glycine
site
of
NMDA
receptors
in
rostral
and
intermediate
-
caudal
parts
of
the
striatum
to
the
regulation
of
muscle
tone
in
rats
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
assess
the
contribution
of
the
glycine
site
of
NMDA
receptors
in
the
striatum
to
the
regulation
of
muscle
tone
.

Muscle
tone
was
examined
using
a
combined
mechanoand
electromyographic
method
,
which
measured
simultaneously
the
muscle
resistance
(
MMG
)
of
the
rat
's
hind
foot
to
passive
extension
and
flexion
in
the
ankle
joint
and
the
electromyographic
activity
(
EMG
)
of
the
antagonistic
muscles
of
that
joint
:
gastrocnemius
and
tibialis
anterior
.

Muscle
rigidity
was
induced
by
haloperidol
(
2.5
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

5,7-dichlorokynurenic
acid

(
5,7-DCKA
)
,
a
selective
glycine
site
antagonist
,
injected
in
doses
of
2.5
and
4.5
microg/0.5
microl
bilaterally
,
into
the
rostral
region
of
the
striatum
,
decreased
both
the
haloperidol
-induced

muscle
rigidity
(
MMG
)
and
the
enhanced
electromyographic
activity
(
EMG
)
.

5,7-DCKA
injected
bilaterally
in
a
dose
of
4.5
microg/0.5
microl
into
the
intermediate
-
caudal
region
of
the
striatum
of
rats
not
pretreated
with
haloperidol

had
no
effect
on
the
muscle
tone
.

The
present
results
suggest
that
blockade
of
the
glycine
site
of
NMDA
receptors
in
the
rostral
part
of
the
striatum
may
be
mainly
responsible
for
the
antiparkinsonian
action
of
this
drug
.

-
controlled
trial
,
in
which
participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
placebo
or
lovastatin
at
doses
of
20
or
40
mg
once
daily
,
or
20
or
40
mg
twice
daily
for
48
weeks
.

SETTING
:

Ambulatory
patients
recruited
by
362
participating
centers
throughout
the
United
States
.

PATIENTS
:
Women
(
n
=
3390
)
from
the
total
cohort
of
8245
volunteers
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
Plasma

throughout
the
study
.

RESULTS
:

Among
women
,
lovastatin

(
20
to
80
mg
/
d

)
produced
sustained
(
12-
to
48-week
)
,
dose
-
related
changes
(
P
0.001
)
:
decreases
in
LDL
cholesterol

(
24
%
to
40
%
)
and
triglycerides
(
9
%
to
18
%
)
,
and
increases
in
HDL
cholesterol
(
6.7
%
to
8.6
%
)
.

Depending
on
the
dose
,
from
82
%
to
95
%
of
lovastatin
-treated
women
achieved
the
National
Cholesterol
Education
Program
goal
of
LDL
cholesterol
levels
less
than
4.14
mmol
/
L
(
160
mg
/
dL
)
,
and
40
%
to
87
%
achieved
the
goal
of
3.36
mmol
/

L
(
130
mg
/
dL
)
.

Successive
transaminase
elevations
greater
than
three
times
the
upper
limit
of
normal
occurred
in
0.1
%
of
women
and
were
dose
dependent
above
the
20-mg
dose
.

Myopathy
,
defined
as
muscle
symptoms
with
creatine

kinase
elevations
greater
than
10
times
the
upper
limit
of
normal
,
was
rare
and
associated
with
the
highest
recommended
daily
dose
of
lovastatin

(
80
mg
)
.

Estrogen
-
replacement
therapy
appeared
to
have
no
effect
on
either
the
efficacy
or
safety
profile
of
lovastatin
.

CONCLUSION
:

Lovastatin
is
highly
effective
and
generally
well
tolerated
as
therapy
for
primary
hypercholesterolemia
in
women
.

REM

Extrapyramidal
side
effects
and
oral
haloperidol
:
an
analysis
of
explanatory
patient
and
treatment
characteristics
.

The
incidence
of
extrapyramidal
side
effects
(
EPS
)
was
evaluated
in
98
patients
treated
with
haloperidol
.

The
incidence
of
parkinsonism
was
higher
at
higher
doses
of
haloperidol
and
in
younger
patients
.

Prophylactic
antiparkinsonian
medication
was
effective
in
younger
but
not
in
older
patients
.

However
,
these
medications
were
more
effective
in
both
young
and
old
patients
when
given
after
parkinsonism
developed
.

Akathisia
was
controlled
by
the
benzodiazepine
lorazepam
in
14
out
of
16
patients
,
while
prophylactic
antiparkinsonians
were
ineffective
.

The
present
study
points
to
patient
characteristics
that
may
be
of
significance
in
the
development
of
EPS
due
to
haloperidol
.

Hepatic
veno
-
occlusive
disease
caused
by
6-thioguanine
.

Clinically
reversible
veno
-
occlusive
disease
of
the
liver
developed
in
a
23-year
-
old
man
with
acute
lymphocytic
leukemia
after
10
months
of
maintenance
therapy
with
6-thioguanine
.

Serial
liver
biopsies
showed
the
development
and
resolution
of
intense
sinusoidal
engorgement
.

Although
this
disease
was
clinically
reversible
,
some
subintimal

fibrosis
about
the
terminal
hepatic
veins
persisted
.

This
case
presented
a
unique
opportunity
to
observe
the
histologic
features
of
clinically
reversible
hepatic
veno
-
occlusive
disease
over
time
,
and
may
be
the
first
case
of
veno
-
occlusive
related
solely
to
6-thioguanine
.

Treatment
of
ifosfamide
-induced
urothelial
toxicity
by
oral
administration
of
sodium
2-mercaptoethane
sulphonate

(
MESNA
)
to
patients
with
inoperable
lung
cancer
.

The
protective
effect
of
oral
administration
of
the
thiol
compound
sodium
2-mercaptoethane
sulphonate

(
MESNA
)
against
urothelial
toxicity
induced
by
ifosfamide

(
IF
)
was
tested
in
a
group
of
45
patients
with
inoperable
lung
cancer
under
treatment
with
IF

(
2250
mg
/
m2
on
days
2
-
5
)
as
part
of
a
polychemotherapy
regimen
repeated
in
a
4-week
cycle
.

MESNA
was
given
orally
on
the
days
of
treatment
with
IF
in
3
doses
of
840
mg
/
m2
,
each
administered
at
0
hr
(=
injection
of
IF
)
,
4
hr
and
8
hr
p.i
.

Out
of
a
total
of
88
courses
of
this
treatment
we
observed
10
episodes
of
asymptomatic
microscopic
haematuria
and
no
episodes
of
gross
haematuria
.

In
this
group
of
45
patients
under
protection
with
MESNA
there
were
5
complete
remissions
and
9
partial
remissions
(
total
31
%
)
.

A
further
group
of
25
patients
under
polychemotherapy
with
IF
were
treated
by
conventional
prophylactic
measures
(
raised
fluid
intake
and
forced
diuresis
)
.

In
this
group
there
were
1
complete
and
5
partial
remissions
(
total
24
%
)
,
but
nearly
all
patients
developed
either
gross
haematuria
and/or
symptoms
of
bladder
irritation

(
cystitis
and
pollakisuria
)
.

There
were
no
appreciable
differences
between
the
MESNA
series
and
the
conventional
prophylaxis
series
with
respect
to
either
haematological
or
systemic
toxicity
of
the
cytostatic
treatment
.

Our
results
support
the
view
that
MESNA
,
given
orally
in
conjunction
with
combined
cytostatic
regimens
which
include
IF
,
simplifies
the
treatment
and
provides
optimum
protection
for
the
urinary
epithelium
.

Protection
with
oral
MESNA
is
particularly
suitable
for
outpatients
.

Time

was
made
30
seconds
and
one
,

.

The
subjects
were
ten

.

Significant
QTC

occurred
in

.

More
than
50
%
of
Lobund

rats
developed
large

,
and
most
of
the
tumor

rats
manifested
metastatic

.

The
incubation
periods
averaged
10.6
months
.

Within
the
same
timeframe
,
no
L

W
rat
developed
a
similar
palpable
PA
when
treated
only
with

A
dystonia
-like
syndrome
after
neuropeptide
(
MSH
/
ACTH
)
stimulation
of
the
rat
locus
ceruleus
.

The
movement
disorder
investigated
in
these
studies
has
some
features
in
common
with
human
idiopathic
dystonia
,
and
information
obtained
in
these
studies
may
be
of
potential
clinical
benefit
.

The
present
experimental
results
indicated
that
peptidergic
stimulation
of
the
LC
resulted
in
a
NE
-
mediated
inhibition
of
cerebellar
Purkinje
cells
located
at
terminals
of
the
ceruleo
-
cerebellar
pathway
.

However
,
it
is
not
certain
as
to
the
following
:
(
a
)
what
receptors
were
stimulated
by
the
ACTH
N
-
terminal
fragments
at
the
LC
that
resulted
in
this
disorder
;
(
b
)
whether
NE
,
released
onto
Purkinje
cell
synapses
located
at
terminals
of
the
ceruleo
-
cerebellar
pathway
,
did
indeed
cause
the
long
-
term
depression
at
Purkinje
cell
synapses
(
previously
described
by
others
)
that
resulted
in
the
long
duration
of
the
movement
disorder
;
(
c
)
whether
the
inhibition
of
inhibitory
Purkinje
cells
resulted
in
disinhibition
or
increased
excitability
of
the
unilateral
cerebellar
fastigial
or
interpositus
nuclei
,
the
output
targets
of
the
Purkinje
cell
axons
,
that
may
have
been
an
important
contributing
factor
to
this
disorder
.

These
questions
are

Dexmedetomidine
,
acting
through
central
alpha-2
adrenoceptors
,
prevents
opiate
-
induced
muscle
rigidity
in
the
rat
.

The
highly
-
selective
alpha-2
adrenergic
agonist
dexmedetomidine

(
D
-
MED
)
is
capable
of
inducing
muscle
flaccidity
and
anesthesia
in
rats
and
dogs
.

Intense
generalized
muscle
rigidity
is
an
undesirable
side
effect
of
potent
opiate
agonists
.

Although
the
neurochemistry
of
opiate
-
induced
rigidity
has
yet
to
be
fully
elucidated
,
recent
work
suggests
a
role
for
a
central
adrenergic
mechanism
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
authors
determined
if
treatment
with
D

MED
prevents
the
muscle
rigidity
caused
by
high

in
the

treatment
.

Each
rat
was
then
injected
with
alfentanil

(
ALF

)
.

ALF
injection
resulted
in
a
marked
increase
in

EMG
activity
in
the
L

MED
treatment
group
which
was
indistinguishable
from
that
seen
in
animals
treated
with
saline
.

In
contrast
,
D

prevented

alfentanil

in
a

fashion
.

The
small
EMG
values
obtained
in

were
comparable
with
those
recorded
in

The
effects
of
insulin
treatment
on
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
urinary
bladder
function
in
streptozotocin
-
diabetic
rats
were
investigated
.

Diabetes
of
2
months
duration
resulted
in
decreases
in
body
weight
and
increases
in
fluid
consumption
,
urine

,
frequency
of
micturition
,
and
average
volume
per

;
effects
which
were
prevented
by
insulin

Insulin
treatment
also
prevented
the
increases
in

from
diabetic
rats
to
nerve
stimulation
,
ATP
,
and
bethanechol
.

.

Diabetes
of
4
months

also
resulted
in
decreases
in
body
weight
,
and
increases
in
fluid
consumption
,
urine
volume
,
frequency
of
micturition
,
and
average

,
effects
which
were
reversed
by
insulin

The
data
indicate
that
the

diabetes
on
urinary

are
both
prevented
and
reversed
by
insulin

Delayed
institution
of
hypertension
during
focal
cerebral
ischemia
:
effect
on
brain
edema
.

The
effect
of
induced
hypertension
instituted
after
a
2-h
delay
following
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion

(
MCAO
)
on
brain
edema
formation
and
histochemical
injury
was
studied
.

Under
isoflurane
anesthesia
,
the
MCA
of
14
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
was
occluded
.

In
the
control
group
(
n
=
7
)
,
the
mean
arterial
pressure
(
MAP
)
was
not
manipulated
.

In
the
hypertensive
group
(
n
=
7
)
,
the
MAP
was
elevated
by
25
-
30
mm
Hg
beginning
2
h
after
MCAO
.

Four
hours
after

MCAO
,
the
rats
were
killed
and
the
brains
harvested
.

The
brains
were
sectioned
along
coronal
planes
spanning
the
distribution
of
ischemia
produced
by
MCAO
.

Specific
gravity
(
SG
)
was
determined
in
the
subcortex
and
in
two
sites
in
the
cortex
(
core
and
periphery
of
the
ischemic
territory
)
.

The
extent
of
neuronal
injury
was
determined
by
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
staining
.

In
the
ischemic
core
,
there
was
no
difference
in
SG
in
the
subcortex
and
cortex
in
the
two
groups
.

In
the
periphery
of
the
ischemic
territory
,
SG
in
the
cortex
was
greater
(
less
edema
accumulation
)
in
the
hypertensive
group
(
1.041
+
/-
0.001
vs
1.039
+
/-
0.001
,
P
less
than
0.05
)
.

The
area
of
histochemical
injury
(
as
a
percent
of
the
cross
-
sectional
area
of
the
hemisphere
)
was
less
in
the
hypertensive
group
(
33
+
/-
3
%
vs
21
+
/-

2
%
,
P
less
than
0.05
)
.

The
data
indicate
that
phenylephrine
-induced
hypertension
instituted
2
h
after
MCAO
does
not
aggravate
edema
in
the
ischemic
core
,
that
it
improves
edema
in
the
periphery
of
the
ischemic
territory
,
and
that
it
reduces
the
area
of
histochemical
neuronal
dysfunction
.

Amiodarone
pulmonary
toxicity
.

Amiodarone
is
an
effective
antiarrhythmic
agent
whose
utility
is
limited
by
many
side
-
effects
,
the
most
problematic
being
pneumonitis
.

The
pulmonary
toxicity
of
amiodarone
is
thought
to
result
from
direct
injury
related
to
the
intracellular
accumulation
of
phospholipid
and
T
cell
-
mediated
hypersensitivity
pneumonitis
.

The
clinical
and
radiographic
features
of
amiodarone
-induced

pulmonary
toxicity
are
characteristic
but
nonspecific
.

The
diagnosis
depends
on
exclusion
of
other
entities
,
such
as
heart
failure
,
infection
,
and
malignancy
.

While
withdrawal
of
amiodarone
leads
to
clinical
improvement
in
majority
of
cases
,
this
is
not
always
possible
or
advisable
.

Dose
reduction
or
concomitant
steroid
therapy
may
have
a
role

Light
chain
proteinuria
and
cellular

immunity
in

rifampin
treated
patients
with
tuberculosis
.

Light
chain

proteinuria
was
found
in
9
of
17

tuberculosis
patients
treated
with
rifampin
.

Concomitant
assay
of
cellular
mediated
immunity
in
these
patients
using
skin
test
antigen
and
a
lymphokine
in
vitro
test
provided
results
that
were
different
.

Response
to
Varidase
skin
test
antigen
was
negative
for
all
eight
tuberculosis
patients
tested
,
but
there
occurred
a
hyper
-
responsiveness
of
the
lymphocytes
of
these
eight
patients
to
phytomitogen
(
PHA
-
P
)
.

as
well
as
of
those
of
seven
other
tuberculous
patients
.

This
last
finding
may
be
related
to
time
of
testing
and/or
endogenous
serum
binding
of
rifampin
which
could
have
inhibited
mitogen
activity
for
the
lymphocyte
.

Initial
potassium
loss
and
hypokalaemia
during
chlorthalidone
administration
in
patients
with
essential
hypertension
:
the
influence
of
dietary
sodium
restriction
.

To
investigate
the
initial
potassium
loss
and
development
of
hypokalaemia
during
the
administration
of
an
oral
diuretic
,
metabolic
balance
studies
were
performed
in
ten
patients
with
essential
hypertension
who
had
shown
hypokalaemia
under
prior
oral
diuretic
treatment
.

Chlorthalidone
(
50
mg
daily
)
was
given
for
14
days
.

Six
patients
received
a
normal-
sodium
diet
and
four
a
low-
sodium
(
17
mmol
/
day
)
diet
.

All
patients
had
a
normal
initial
total
body
potassium

(
40
K
)
.

The
electrolyte
balances
,
weight
,
bromide
space
,
plasma
renin
activity
,
and
aldosterone
secretion
rate
were
measured
.

In
both
groups
a
potassium
deficit
developed
,
with
proportionally
larger
losses
from
the
extracellular
than
from
the
intracellular
compartment
.

In
the
normal-
sodium
group
the
highest
mean
potassium
deficit
was
176
mmol
on
day
9
,
after
which
some
potassium
was
regained
;
in
the
low-
sodium
group
the
highest
deficit
was
276
mmol
on
day
13
.

The
normal-
sodium
group
showed
an
immediate
but
temporary
rise
of
the
renin
and
aldosterone
levels
;
in
the
low-
sodium
group
renin
and
aldosterone
increased
more
slowly
but
remained
elevated
.

It
is
concluded
that
dietary
sodium
restriction
increases
diuretic
-
induced
potassium
loss
,
presumably
by
an
increased
activity
of
the
renin-
angiotensin
-
aldosterone
system
,
while
sodium
delivery
to
the
distal
renal
tubules
remains
sufficiently
high
to
allow
increased
potassium
secretion
.

Dynamic
response
of
blood
vessel
in
acute
renal
failure
.

In
this
study
we
postulated
that
during
acute
renal
failure
induced
by
gentamicin
the
transient
or
dynamic
response
of
blood
vessels
could
be
affected
,
and
that
antioxidants
can
prevent
the
changes
in
dynamic
responses
of
blood
vessels
.

The
new
approach
to
ex
vivo
blood
vessel
experiments
in
which
not
only
the
end
points
of
vessels
response
within
the
time
interval
is
considered
,
but
also
dynamics
of
this
response
,
was
used
in
this
paper
.

Our
results
confirm
the
alteration
in
dynamic
response
of
blood
vessels
during
the
change
of
pressure
in
gentamicin

-treated
animals
.

The
beneficial
effects
of
vitamin
C
administration
to
gentamicin

-treated
animals
are
also
confirmed
through
:
lower
level
of
blood
urea
and
creatinine
and
higher
level
of
potassium
.

The
pressure
dynamic
responses
of
isolated
blood
vessels
show
a
faster
pressure
change
in
gentamicin

-treated
animals
(
8.07

The

,
confirm
the
alteration
in

The
hemodynamics
of
oxytocin
and
other
vasoactive
agents
during
neuraxial
anesthesia
for
cesarean
delivery
:
findings
in
six
cases
.

Oxytocin
is
a
commonly
used
uterotonic
that
can
cause
significant
and
even
fatal
hypotension
,
particularly
when
given
as
a
bolus
.

The
resulting
hypotension
can
be
produced
by
a
decrease
in
systemic
vascular
resistance
or
cardiac
output
through
a
decrease
in
venous
return
.

Parturients
with
normal
volume
status
,
heart
valves
and
pulmonary
vasculature
most
often
respond
to
this
hypotension
with
a
compensatory
increase
in
heart
rate
and
stroke
volume
.

Oxytocin
-induced

hypotension
at
cesarean
delivery
may
be
incorrectly
attributed
to
blood
loss
.

Pulse
power
analysis
(
also
called
"
pulse
contour
analysis
"
)
of
an
arterial
pressure
wave
form
allows
continuous
evaluation
of
systemic
vascular
resistance
and
cardiac
output
in
real
time
,
thereby
elucidating
the
causative
factors
behind
changes
in
blood
pressure
.

Pulse
power
analysis
was
conducted
in
six
cases
of
cesarean
delivery
performed
under
neuraxial
anesthesia
.

Hypotension
in
response
to

oxytocin
was
associated
with
a
decrease
in
systemic
vascular
resistance
and
a
compensatory
increase
in
stroke
volume
,
heart
rate
and
cardiac
output
.

Pulse
power
analysis
may
be
helpful
in
determining
the
etiology
of
and
treating
hypotension
during
cesarean
delivery
under
neuraxial
anesthesia
.

Exaggerated
expression
of
inflammatory
mediators
in
vasoactive
intestinal
polypeptide
knockout

(
VIP-/-
)
mice
with
cyclophosphamide

(
CYP
)
-induced
cystitis
.

Vasoactive
intestinal
polypeptide
(
VIP
)
is
an
immunomodulatory
neuropeptide
distributed
in
micturition
pathways
.

VIP(-/-
)
mice
exhibit
altered
bladder
function
and
neurochemical
properties
in
micturition
pathways
after
cyclophosphamide

(
CYP
)
-induced
cystitis
.

Given
VIP
's
role
as
an
anti
-
inflammatory
mediator
,
we
hypothesized
that
VIP(-/-
)
mice
would
exhibit
enhanced
inflammatory
mediator
expression
after
cystitis
.

A
mouse
inflammatory
cytokine
and
receptor
RT2
profiler
array
was
used
to
determine
regulated
transcripts
in
the
urinary
bladder
of
wild
type
(
WT
)
and
VIP(-/-
)
mice
with
or
without

CYP
-induced

cystitis

(
150
mg
/
kg
;
i.p
.
;
48
h
)
.

Four
binary
comparisons
were
made
:
WT
control
versus
CYP
treatment
(
48
h
)
,
VIP(-/-
)
control
versus
CYP
treatment
(
48
h
)
,
WT
control
versus
VIP(-/-
)
control
,
and
WT
with
CYP
treatment
(
48
h
)
versus
VIP(-/-
)
with
CYP
treatment
(
48
h
)
.

The
genes
presented
represent
(
1
)
greater
than
1.5-fold
change
in
either
direction
and
(
2
)
the
p
value
is
less
than
0.05
for
the
comparison
being
made
.

Several
regulated
genes
were
validated
using
enzyme
-
linked
immunoassays
including
IL-1beta
and
CXCL1
.

CYP
treatment
significantly
(
p
or
=
0.001
)
increased
expression
of
CXCL1
and
IL-1beta
in
the
urinary
bladder
of
WT
and
VIP(-/-
)
mice
,
but
expression
in
VIP(-/-
)
mice
with
CYP
treatment
was
significantly
(
p
or
=
0.001
)
greater
(
4.2-
to
13-fold
increase
)
than
that
observed
in
WT
urinary
bladder
(
3.6-
to
5-fold
increase
)
.

The
data
suggest
that
in
VIP(-/-
)
mice
with
bladder
inflammation
,
inflammatory
mediators
are
increased
above
that
observed
in
WT
with
CYP
.

This
shift
in
balance
may
contribute
to
increased
bladder
dysfunction
in
VIP(-/-
)
mice
with
bladder
inflammation
and
altered
neurochemical
expression
in
micturition
pathways
.

Intraocular
pressure
in
patients
with
uveitis
treated
with
fluocinolone
acetonide
implants
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
the
incidence
and
management
of
elevated
intraocular
pressure

(
IOP
)
in
patients
with
uveitis
treated
with
the
fluocinolone
acetonide

(
FA
)
intravitreal
implant
.

DESIGN
:

Pooled
data
from
3
multicenter
,
double
-
masked
,
randomized
,
controlled
,
phase
2b/3
clinical
trials
evaluating
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
the
0.59-mg
or
2.1-mg
FA
intravitreal
implant
or
standard
therapy
were
analyzed
.

RESULTS
:

During
the
3-year
follow
-
up
,
71.0
%
of
implanted
eyes
had
an
IOP
increase
of
10
mm
Hg
or
more
than
baseline
and
55.1
%
,
24.7
%
,
and
6.2
%
of
eyes
reached
an
IOP
of
30
mm
Hg
or
more
,
40
mm
Hg
or
more
,
and
50
mm
Hg
or
more
,
respectively
.

Topical
IOP
-
lowering
medication
was
administered
in
74.8
%
of
implanted
eyes
,
and
IOP
-
lowering
surgeries
,
most
of
which
were
trabeculectomies
(
76.2
%
)
,
were
performed
on
36.6
%
of
implanted
eyes
.

Intraocular
pressure
-
lowering
surgeries
were
considered
a
success
(
postoperative
IOP
of
6
-
21
mm
Hg
with
or
without
additional
IOP
-
lowering
medication
)
in
85.1
%
of
eyes
at
1
year
.

The
rate
of
hypotony

(
IOP
/=
5
mm
Hg
)
following
IOP
-
lowering
surgery
(
42.5
%
)
was
not
different
from
that
of
implanted
eyes
not
subjected
to
surgery
(
35.4
%
)

(
P
=
.09
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

Elevated
IOP
is
a
significant
complication
with
the
FA
intravitreal
implant
but
may
be
controlled
with
medication
and
surgery
.

Pallidal
stimulation
:
an
alternative
to
pallidotomy
?

A
resurgence
of
interest
in
the
surgical
treatment
of
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
came
with
the
rediscovery
of
posteroventral
pallidotomy
by
Laitinen
in
1985
.

Laitinen
's
procedure
improved
most
symptoms
in
drug
-
resistant
PD
,
which
engendered
wide
interest
in
the
neurosurgical
community
.

Another
lesioning
procedure
,
ventrolateral
thalamotomy
,
has
become
a
powerful
alternative
to
stimulate
the
nucleus
ventralis
intermedius
,
producing
high
long
-
term
success
rates
and
low
morbidity
rates
.

Pallidal
stimulation
has
not
met
with
the
same
success
.

According
to
the
literature
pallidotomy
improves
the
"
on
"
symptoms
of
PD
,
such
as
dyskinesias
,
as
well
as
the
"
off
"
symptoms
,
such
as
rigidity
,
bradykinesia
,
and
on
-
off
fluctuations
.

Pallidal
stimulation
improves

bradykinesia
and
rigidity
to
a
minor
extent
;
however
,
its
strength
seems
to
be
in
improving
levodopa

-induced

dyskinesias
.

Stimulation
often
produces
an
improvement
in
the
hyper-
or
dyskinetic
upper
limbs
,
but
increases
the
"
freezing
"
phenomenon
in
the
lower
limbs
at
the
same
time
.

Considering
the
small
increase
in
the
patient
's
independence
,
the
high
costs
of
bilateral
implants
,
and
the
difficulty
most
patients
experience
in
handling
the
devices
,
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
bilateral
pallidal
stimulation
is
a
real
alternative
to
pallidotomy
.

Case
report
:
Dexatrim

(
Phenylpropanolamine
)
as
a
cause
of
myocardial
infarction
.

Phenylpropanolamine

(
PPA
)
is
a
sympathetic
amine
used
in
over
-
the
-
counter
cold
remedies
and
weight
-
control
preparations
worldwide
.

Its
use
has
been
associated
with
hypertensive
episodes
and
hemorrhagic
strokes
in
younger
women
.

Several
reports
have
linked
the
abuse
of
PPA
with
myocardial
injury
,
especially
when
overdose
is
involved
.

We
report
here
the
first
case
of
Dexatrim

(
PPA
)
-induced

myocardial
injury
in
a
young
woman
who
was
using
it
at
recommended
doses
for
weight
control
.

In
addition
,
we
review
the
7
other
cases
of
PPA
related
myocardial
injury

that
have
been
reported
so
far
.

Physicians
and
patients
should
be
alert
to
the
potential
cardiac
risk
associated
with
the
use
of
PPA
,
even
at
doses
generally
considered
to
be
safe
.

Risperidone
-associated
,
benign
transient
visual
disturbances
in
schizophrenic
patients
with
a
past
history
of
LSD
abuse
.

Two

schizophrenic
patients
,
who
had
a
prior
history
of
LSD
abuse

and
who
had
previously
developed

EPS
with
classic
antipsychotics
,
were
successfully
treated
with
risperidone
.

They
both
reported
short
episodes
of
transient
visual
disturbances
,
which
appeared
immediately
after
starting
treatment
with
risperidone
.

This
imagery
resembled
visual
disturbances
previously
experienced
as
"
flashbacks
"
related
to
prior
LSD
consumption
.

Risperidone
administration
was
continued
and
the
visual
disturbances
gradually
wore
off
.

During
a
six
-
month
follow
-
up
period
,
there
was
no
recurrence
of
visual
disturbances
.

This
phenomenon
may
be
interpreted
as
a
benign
,
short
-
term
and
self
-
limiting
side
effect
which
does
not
contraindicate
the
use
of
risperidone
or
interfere
with
treatment
.

Conclusions
based
on
two
case
reports
should
be
taken
with
appropriate
caution
.

Activation
of
poly(ADP
-
ribose
)
polymerase
contributes
to
development
of
doxorubicin

-induced

heart
failure
.

Activation
of
the
nuclear
enzyme

poly(ADP
-
ribose
)
polymerase
(
PARP
)
by
oxidant
-
mediated
DNA
damage
is
an
important
pathway
of
cell
dysfunction
and
tissue
injury
in
conditions
associated
with
oxidative
stress
.

Increased
oxidative
stress
is
a
major
factor
implicated
in
the
cardiotoxicity
of
doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
,
a
widely
used
antitumor
anthracycline
antibiotic
.

Thus
,
we
hypothesized
that
the
activation
of
PARP
may
contribute
to
the
DOX
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

Using
a
dual
approach
of
PARP-1
suppression
,
by
genetic
deletion
or
pharmacological
inhibition
with
the
phenanthridinone
PARP
inhibitor
PJ34
,
we
now
demonstrate
the
role
of
PARP
in
the
development
of
cardiac
dysfunction
induced
by
DOX
.

PARP-1+/+
and
PARP-1-/-
mice
received
a
single
injection
of
DOX

(
25
mg
/
kg
i.p
)
.

Five
days
after
DOX
administration
,
left
ventricular
performance
was
significantly
depressed
in
PARP-1+/+
mice
,
but
only
to
a
smaller
extent
in
PARP-1-/-
ones
.

Similar
experiments
were
conducted
in
BALB
/

c
mice
treated
with
PJ34
or
vehicle
.

Treatment
with
a
PJ34
significantly
improved

cardiac
dysfunction
and
increased
the
survival
of
the
animals
.

In
addition
PJ34
significantly
reduced
the
DOX
-induced
increase
in
the
serum
lactate
dehydrogenase
and
creatine
kinase
activities
but
not
metalloproteinase
activation
in
the
heart
.

Thus
,
PARP
activation
contributes
to
the
cardiotoxicity
of
DOX
.

PARP
inhibitors
may
exert
protective
effects
against
the
development
of
severe
cardiac
complications
associated
with
the
DOX
treatment
.

Fluconazole
-induced
torsade
de
pointes
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
present
a
case
of
fluconazole
-associated
torsade
de
pointes

(
TDP
)
and
discuss
fluconazole
's
role
in
causing
TDP
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
68-year
-
old
white
woman
with
Candida
glabrata
isolated
from
a
presacral
abscess
developed
TDP

eight
days
after
commencing
oral
fluconazole

The
patient
had
no
other
risk
factors
for
TDP
,
including
coronary
artery
disease
,
cardiomyopathy
,
congestive
heart
failure
,
and
electrolyte
abnormalities

There
was
a
temporal
association
between
the
initiation
of
fluconazole
and
TDP
.

The
TDP
resolved
when
fluconazole
was
discontinued
;
however
,
the
patient
continued
to
have
premature
ventricular
contractions
and
nonsustained
ventricular
tachycardia

(
NSVT
)
until
six
days
after
drug
cessation

DISCUSSION
:

Use
of
the
Naranjo
probability
scale
indicates
a
probable
relationship
between
the
use
of
fluconazole
and
the
development
of
TDP
.

The
possible
mechanism
is
depression
of
rapidly
activating
delayed
rectifier
potassium
currents
.

In
our
patient
,
there
was
no
other
etiology
identified
that
could
explain
QT
prolongation
or
TDP

The
complete
disappearance
of
NSVT
and
premature
ventricular
contractions
followed
by
normalization
of
QT
interval
after
the
drug
was
stopped
strongly
suggests

fluconazole
as
the
etiology
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Clinicians
should
be
aware
that
fluconazole
,
even
at
low
doses
,
may
cause
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
,
leading
to
TDP
.

Serial
electrocardiographic
monitoring
may
be
considered
when
fluconazole
is
administered
in
patients
who
are
at
risk
for
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

High
-
dose

methylprednisolone
may
do
more
harm
for
spinal
cord
injury
.

Because
of
the
National
Acute
Spinal
Cord
Injury

Studies
(
NASCIS
)
,
high
-
dose

methylprednisolone
became
the
standard
of
care
for
the
acute
spinal
cord
injury
.

In
the
NASCIS
,
there
was
no
mention
regarding
the
possibility
of
acute
corticosteroid
myopathy
that
high
-
dose
methylprednisolone
may
cause
.

The
dosage
of
methylprednisolone
recommended
by
the
NASCIS
3
is
the
highest
dose
of
steroids
ever
being
used
during
a
2-day
period
for
any
clinical
condition
.

We
hypothesize
that
it
may
cause
some
damage
to
the
muscle
of
spinal
cord
injury
patients
.

Further
,
steroid
myopathy
recovers
naturally
and
the
neurological
improvement
shown
in
the
NASCIS
may
be
just
a
recording
of
this
natural
motor
recovery
from
the
steroid
myopathy
,
instead
of
any
protection
that
methylprednisolone
offers
to
the
spinal
cord
injury
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
discussion
considering
the
possibility
that
the
methylprednisolone
recommended
by
NASCIS
may
cause
acute
corticosteroid
myopathy
.

Probing
peripheral
and
central
cholinergic
system
responses
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
pharmacological
response
to
drugs
that
act
on
the
cholinergic
system
of
the
iris
has
been
used
to
predict
deficits
in
central
cholinergic
functioning
due
to
diseases
such
as
Alzheimer
's
disease
,
yet
correlations
between
central
and
peripheral
responses
have
not
been
properly
studied
.

This
study
assessed
the
effect
of
normal
aging
on
(
1
)
the
tropicamide
-induced
increase
in
pupil
diameter
,
and
(
2
)
the
reversal
of
this
effect
with
pilocarpine
.

Scopolamine
was
used
as
a
positive
control
to
detect
age
-
dependent
changes
in
central
cholinergic
functioning
in
the
elderly
.

DESIGN
:

Randomized
double
-
blind
controlled
trial
.

PARTICIPANTS
:
Ten
healthy
elderly
(
mean
age
70
)
and
9
young
(
mean
age
33
)
volunteers
.

INTERVENTIONS
:

Pupil
diameter
was
monitored
using
a
computerized
infrared
pupillometer
over
4
hours
.

The
study
involved
4
sessions
.

In
1
session
,
tropicamide
(
20
microL
,
0.01
%
)
was
administered
to
one
eye
and
placebo
to
the
other
.

In
another
session
,
tropicamide
(
20
microL
,
0.01
%
)
was
administered
to
both
eyes
,
followed
23
minutes
later
by
the
application
of
pilocarpine

(
20
microL
,
0.1
%
)
to
one
eye
and
placebo
to
the
other
.

All
eye
drops
were
given
in
a
randomized
order
.

In
2
separate
sessions
,
a
single
dose
of
scopolamine

(
0.5
mg
,
intravenously
)
or
placebo
was
administered
,
and
the
effects
on
word
recall
were
measured
using
the
Buschke
Selective
Reminding
Test
over
2
hours
.

OUTCOME
MEASURES
:

Pupil
size
at
time
points
after
administration
of
tropicamide
and
pilocarpine
;
scopolamine
-induced
impairment
in
word
recall
.

RESULTS
:

There
was
no
significant
difference
between
elderly
and
young
volunteers
in
pupillary
response
to
tropicamide
at
any
time
point
(
p
>
0.05
)
.

The
elderly
group
had
a
significantly
greater
pilocarpine
-induced
net
decrease
in
pupil
size
85
,
125
,
165
and
215
minutes
after
administration
,
compared
with
the
young
group
(
p
0.05
)
.

Compared
with
the
young
group
,
the
elderly
group
had
greater
scopolamine

-induced

impairment
in
word
recall
60
,
90
and
120
minutes
after
administration
(
p
0.05
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

There
is
an
age
-
related
pupillary
response
to
pilocarpine
that
is
not
found
with
tropicamide
.

Thus
,
pilocarpine
may
be
useful
to
assess
variations
in
central
cholinergic
function
in
elderly
patients
.

Acetazolamide
-induced
Gerstmann
syndrome
.

Acute
confusion
induced
by
acetazolamide
is
a
well
known
adverse
drug
reaction
in
patients
with
renal
impairment
.

We
report
a
case
of
acetazolamide
-induced
Gerstmann
syndrome
in
a
patient
with
normal
renal
function
,
to
highlight
predisposing
factors
that
are
frequently
overlooked
.

Hypomania
-like
syndrome
induced
by
olanzapine
.

We
report
a
female
patient
with
a
diagnosis
of
a
not
otherwise
specified
psychotic
disorder
(
DSM
-
IV
)
who
developed
hypomania
shortly
after
the
introduction
of
olanzapine
treatment
.

Neutrophil
superoxide
and
hydrogen
peroxide
production
in
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
.

Defects
in
superoxide
and
hydrogen
peroxide
production
may
be
implicated
in
the
high
incidence
of
bacterial
infections
in
patients
with
acute
liver
failure

(
ALF
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
oxygen
radical
production
in
patients
with
ALF
due
to
paracetamol

overdose
was
compared
with
that
of
healthy
volunteers
.

Neutrophils
from
14
ALF
patients
were
stimulated
via
the
complement
receptors
using
zymosan
opsonized
with
ALF
or
control
serum
.

Superoxide
and
hydrogen
peroxide
production
by
ALF
neutrophils
stimulated
with
zymosan
opsonized
with
ALF
serum
was
significantly
reduced
compared
with
the
control
subjects
(
P
0.01
)
.

This
defect
persisted
when
zymosan
opsonized
by
control
serum
was
used
(
P
0.05
)
.

Superoxide
and
hydrogen
peroxide
production
in
neutrophils
stimulated
with
formyl
-
methionyl
-
leucyl
-
phenylalanine

(
fMLP
)
from
a
further
18
ALF

patients
was
unaffected
compared
with
control
neutrophils
.

Serum
C3
complement
levels
were
significantly
reduced
in
ALF
patients
compared
with
control
subjects
(
P
0.0005
)
.

These
results
demonstrate
a
neutrophil
defect
in
ALF
due
to
paracetamol
overdose
,
that
is
complement
dependent
but
independent
of
serum
complement
,
possibly
connected
to
the
complement
receptor
.

Absence
of
effect
of
sertraline
on
time
-
based
sensitization
of
cognitive
impairment
with
haloperidol
.

This
double
-
blind
,
randomized
,
placebo
-
controlled
study
evaluated
the
effects
of
haloperidol
alone
and
haloperidol
plus
sertraline
on
cognitive
and
psychomotor
function
in
24
healthy
male
subjects
.

METHOD
:

All
subjects
received
placebo
on
Day
1
and
haloperidol
2
mg
on
Days
2
and
25
.

From
Days
9
to
25
,
subjects
were
randomly
assigned
to
either
sertraline

(
12
subjects
)
or
placebo
(
12
subjects
)
;
the
sertraline
dose
was
titrated
from
50
to
200
mg
/
day
from
Days
9
to
16
,
and
remained
at
200
mg
/
day
for
the
final
10
days
of
the
drug
administration
period
.

Cognitive
function
testing
was
performed
before
dosing
and
over
a
24-hour
period
after
dosing
on
Days
1
,
2
,
and
25
.
RESULTS
:

Impairment
of
cognitive
function
was
observed
6
to
8
hours
after
administration
of
haloperidol
on
Day
2
but
was
not
evident
23
hours
after
dosing
.

When
single
-
dose
haloperidol
was
given
again
25
days
later
,
greater
impairment
with
earlier
onset
was
noted
in
several
tests
in
both
treatment
groups
,
suggesting
enhancement
of
this
effect
.

There
was
no
indication
that
sertraline
exacerbated
the
impairment
produced
by
haloperidol
since
an
equivalent
effect
also
occurred
in
the
placebo
group
.

Three
subjects
(
2
on
sertraline
and
1
on
placebo
)
withdrew
from
the
study
because
of
side
effects
.

Ten
subjects
in
each
group
reported
side
effects
related
to
treatment
.

The
side
effect
profiles
of
sertraline
and
of
placebo
were
similar
.

CONCLUSION
:

Haloperidol
produced
a
clear
profile
of
cognitive
impairment

that
was
not
worsened
by
concomitant
sertraline
administration
.

Ciprofloxacin
-induced
nephrotoxicity
in
patients
with
cancer
.

Nephrotoxicity
associated
with
ciprofloxacin
is
uncommon
.

Five
patients
with
cancer
who
developed
acute
renal
failure
that
followed
treatment
with
ciprofloxacin
are
described
and
an
additional
15
cases
reported
in
the
literature
are
reviewed
.

Other
than
elevation
of
serum
creatinine
levels
,
characteristic
clinical
manifestations
and
abnormal
laboratory
findings
are
not
frequently
present
.

Allergic
interstitial
nephritis
is
believed
to
be
the
underlying
pathological
-
process
.

Definitive
diagnosis
requires
performance
of
renal
biopsy
,
although
this
is
not
always
feasible
.

An
improvement
in
renal
function
that
followed
the
discontinuation
of
the
offending
antibiotic
supports
the
presumptive
diagnosis
of
ciprofloxacin

-induced

acute
renal
failure
.

Case
report
:
pentamidine
and
polymorphic
ventricular
tachycardia
revisited
.

Pentamidine
isethionate
has
been
associated
with
ventricular
tachyarrhythmias
,
including
torsade
de
pointes
.

This
article
reports
two
cases
of
this
complication
and
reviews
all
reported
cases
to
date
.

Pentamidine
-induced

torsade
de
pointes
may
be
related
to
serum
magnesium
levels
and

hypomagnesemia
may
synergistically
induce
torsade
.

Torsade
de
pointes
occurred
after
an
average
of
10
days
of
treatment
with
pentamidine
.

In
these
patients
,
no
other
acute
side
effects
of
pentamidine
were
observed
.

Torsade
de
pointes
can
be
treated
when
recognized
early
,
possibly
without
discontinuation
of
pentamidine
.

When
QTc
interval
prolongation
is
observed
,
early
magnesium
supplementation
is
advocated
.

Time
dependence
of
plasma
malondialdehyde
,
oxypurines
,
and
nucleosides
during
incomplete
cerebral
ischemia
in
the
rat
.

Incomplete
cerebral
ischemia

(
30
min
)
was
induced
in
the
rat
by
bilaterally
clamping
the
common
carotid
arteries
.

Peripheral
venous
blood
samples
were
withdrawn
from
the
femoral
vein
four
times
(
once
every
5
min
)
before

ischemia
(
0
time
)
and
5
,
15
,
and
30
min
after
ischemia
.

Plasma
extracts
were
analyzed
by
a
highly
sensitive
high
-
performance
liquid
chromatographic
method
for
the
direct
determination
of
malondialdehyde
,
oxypurines
,
and
nucleosides
.

During
ischemia
,
a
time
-
dependent
increase
of
plasma
oxypurines
and
nucleosides
was
observed
.

Plasma
malondialdehyde
,
which
was
present
in
minimal
amount
at
zero
time
(
0.058
mumol
/
liter
plasma
;
SD
0.015
)
,
increased
after
5
min
of
ischemia
,
resulting
in
a
fivefold
increase
after
30
min
of
carotid
occlusion
(
0.298
mumol
/
liter
plasma
;
SD
0.078
)
.

Increased
plasma

malondialdehyde
was
also
recorded
in
two
other
groups
of
animals
subjected
to
the
same
experimental
model
,
one
receiving
20
mg
/
kg
b.w
.
of
the
cyclooxygenase
inhibitor
acetylsalicylate
intravenously
immediately
before
ischemia
,
the
other
receiving
650
micrograms
/
kg
b.w
.
of
the
hypotensive
drug
nitroprusside
at
a
flow
rate
of
103
microliters
/
min
intravenously
during
ischemia
,
although
in
this
latter
group
malondialdehyde
was
significantly
higher
.

The
present
data
indicate
that
the
determination
of
malondialdehyde
,
oxypurines
,
and
nucleosides
in
peripheral
blood
,
may
be
used
to
monitor
the
metabolic
alterations
of
tissues
occurring
during
ischemic
phenomena.(ABSTRACT

Cholinergic
toxicity
resulting
from
ocular
instillation
of
echothiophate
iodide
eye
drops
.

A
patient
developed
a
severe
cholinergic
syndrome
from
the
use
of
echothiophate
iodide
ophthalmic
drops
,
presented
with
profound
muscle
weakness
and
was
initially
given
the
diagnosis
of
myasthenia
gravis
.

Red
blood
cell
and
serum
cholinesterase
levels
were
severely
depressed
and
symptoms
resolved
spontaneously
following
discontinuation
of
the
eye
drops
.

Acute
renal
failure
in
high
dose
carboplatin
chemotherapy
.

Carboplatin
has
been
reported
to
cause
acute
renal
failure
when
administered
in
high
doses
to
adult
patients
.

We
report
a
4
1/2-year
-
old
girl
who
was
treated
with
high
-
dose
carboplatin
for
metastatic
parameningeal
embryonal
rhabdomyosarcoma
.

Acute
renal
failure
developed
followed
by
a
slow
partial
recovery
of
renal
function
.

Possible
contributing
factors
are
discussed
.

Endometrial
carcinoma
after
Hodgkin
disease
in
childhood
.

A
34-year
-
old
patient
developed
metastic
endometrial
carcinoma
after
Hodgkin
disease
in
childhood
.

She
had
ovarian
failure
after
abdominal
irradiation
and
chemotherapy
for
Hodgkin
disease
,
and
received
exogenous
estrogens
,
a
treatment
implicated
in
the
development
of
endometrial
cancer
in
menopausal
women
.

Young
women
on
replacement
estrogens
for
ovarian
failure
after

cancer
therapy
may
also
have
increased
risk
of
endometrial
carcinoma
and
should
be
examined
periodically
.

Induction
of
the
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
in
a
woman
by
exogenous
androgen
administration
.

We
documented
airway
occlusion
during
sleep
and
an
abnormally
high
supraglottic
resistance
while
awake
in
a
54-yr
-
old
woman
who
had
developed
physical
changes
and
the
syndrome
of
obstructive
sleep
apnea
while
being
administered
exogenous
androgens
.

When
the
androgens
were
withdrawn
,
the
patient
's
physical
changes
,
symptoms
,
sleep
study
,
and
supraglottic
resistance
all
returned
to
normal
.

A
rechallenge
with
androgen
produced
symptoms
of
obstructive
sleep
apnea
that
abated
upon
withdrawal
of
the
hormone
.

Previous
reports
have
favored
a
role
of
androgens
in
the
pathogenesis
of
sleep
apnea
.

Our
report
provides
direct
evidence
for
this
role
.

Structural
and
functional
measurements
indicate
that
androgens
exert
a
permissive
or
necessary
action
on
the
structural
configuration
of
the
oropharynx
that
predisposes
to
obstruction
during
sleep
.

Development
of
the
obstructive
sleep
apnea
syndrome
must
be
considered
a
possible
side
effect
of
androgen
therapy
.

Effect
of
captopril
on
pre
-
existing
and
aminonucleoside
-induced

proteinuria
in
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
.

Proteinuria
is
a
side
effect
of
captopril
treatment
in
hypertensive
patients
.

The
possibility
of
reproducing
the
same
renal
abnormality
with
captopril
was
examined
in
SHR
.

Oral
administration
of
captopril
at
100
mg
/
kg
for
14
days
failed
to
aggravate
proteinuria
pre
-
existing
in
SHR
.

Also
,
captopril
treatment
failed
to
potentiate
or
facilitate
development
of
massive
proteinuria
invoked
by
puromycin
aminonucleoside
in
SHR
.

Captopril
had
little
or
no
demonstrable
effects
on
serum
electrolyte
concentrations
,
excretion
of
urine
,
sodium
and
potassium
,
endogenous
creatinine
clearance
,
body
weight
,
and
food
and
water
consumption
.

However
,
ketone
bodies
were
consistently
present
in
urine
and
several
lethalities
occurred
during
multiple
dosing
of
captopril
in
SHR
.

Epileptogenic
properties
of
enflurane
and
their
clinical
interpretation
.

Three
cases
of
EEG
changes
induced
by
single
exposure
to
enflurane
anesthesia
are
reported
.

In
one
patient
,
enflurane
administered
during
a
donor
nephrectomy
resulted
in
unexpected
partial
motor
seizures
.

Until
the
cause
of
the
seizures
was
correctly
identified
,
the
patient
was
inappropriately
treated
with
anticonvulsants
.

Two
other
patients
suffered
from
partial
,
complex
and
generalized
seizures
uncontrolled
by
medication
.

Epileptic
foci
delineated
and
activated
by
enflurane
were
surgically
ablated
and
the
patients
are
now
seizure
-free
.

Previous
exposures
to
enflurane
have
to
be
disclosed
to
avoid
mistakes
in
clinical
interpretation
of
the
EEG
.

On
the
other
hand
,
enflurane
may
prove
to
be
a
safe
fast
acting
activator
of
epileptic
foci
during
corticography
or
depth
electrode
intraoperative
recordings
.

Reversible
cerebral

associated
with
tiazofurin
usage
:
MR

Tiazofurin
is
an
experimental

We
report
our
results
with
magnetic
resonance
(
MR
)
in
demonstrating
reversible
cerebral

concurrent
with
the

of
this
drug
.

The
abnormalities
on
MR
were
correlated
with
findings
on
CT
as
well
as
with
cerebral

The
utility
of
MR
in
the
evaluation
of
patients
receiving

were
recorded
for
up
to

.

No
significant
differences
between
the
two
groups
were
observed
for
mood
rating
,
amnesia
,
or
vital
signs
.

The
Ro15

group
showed
a
significant
improvement
in
the
performance
test
up
to
120
min
after
administration
of
the

.

There
was
no

Enhanced
stimulus
-
induced
neurotransmitter
overflow
in
epinephrine

-induced

hypertensive
rats
is
not
mediated
by
prejunctional
beta
-
adrenoceptor
activation
.

The
present
study
examines
the
effect
of
6-day
epinephrine
treatment
(
100
micrograms
/
kg
per
h
,
s.c
.
)

on
stimulus
-
induced
(
1
Hz
)
endogenous
neurotransmitter
overflow
from
the
isolated
perfused
kidney
of
vehicle-
and
epinephrine
-treated
rats
.

Renal
catecholamine
stores
and
stimulus
-
induced
overflow
in
the
vehicle
-
treated
group
consisted
of
norepinephrine
only
.

However
,
epinephrine
treatment
resulted
in
the
incorporation
of
epinephrine
into
renal
catecholamine
stores
such
that
approximately
40
%
of
the
catecholamine
present
was

epinephrine
while
the
norepinephrine
content
was
reduced
by
a
similar
degree
.

Total
tissue
catecholamine
content
of
the
kidney
on
a
molar
basis
was
unchanged
.

Stimulus
-
induced
fractional
overflow
of
neurotransmitter
from
the
epinephrine

-treated
kidneys
was
approximately
twice
normal
and
consisted
of
both
norepinephrine
and
epinephrine
in
proportions
similar
to
those
found
in
the
kidney
.

This
difference
in
fractional
overflow
between
groups
was
not
affected
by
neuronal
and
extraneuronal
uptake
blockade
.

Propranolol
had
no
effect
on
stimulus
-
induced
overflow
in
either
group
.

Phentolamine
increased
stimulus
-
induced
overflow
in
both
groups
although
the
increment
in
overflow
was
greater
in
the
epinephrine
-treated
group
.

In
conclusion
,
chronic
epinephrine
treatment
results
in
enhanced
fractional
neurotransmitter
overflow
.

However
,
neither
alterations
in
prejunctional
beta
-
adrenoceptor
influences
nor
alterations
in
neuronal
and
extraneuronal
uptake
mechanisms
appear
to
be
responsible
for
this
alteration
.

Furthermore
,
data
obtained
with
phentolamine
alone
do
not
suggest
alpha
-
adrenoceptor
desensitization
as
the
cause
of
the
enhanced
neurotransmitter
overflow
after
epinephrine
treatment
.

Ocular
manifestations
of
juvenile
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

We
followed
210
cases
of
juvenile
rheumatoid
arthritis
closely
for
eleven
years
.

Thirty
-
six
of
the
210
patients
(
17.2
%
)
developed
iridocyclitis
.

Iridocyclitis
was
seen
most
frequently
in
young
female
patients
(
0
to
4
years
)
with
the
monoarticular
or
pauciatricular
form
of
the
arthritis
.

However
,
30
%
of
the
patients
developed
uveitis
after
16
years
of
age
.

Although
61
%
of
patients
had
a
noncontributory
ocular
history
on
entry
,
42
%
had
active
uveitis
on
entry
.

Our
approach
was
effective
in
detecting
uveitis
in
new
cases
and
exacerbations
of
uveitis
in
established
cases
.

Forty
-
four
percent
of
patients
with
uveitis
had
one
or
more
identifiable
signs
or
symptoms
,
such
as
red
eye
,
ocular
pain
,
decreased
visual
acuity
,
or
photophobia
,
in
order
of
decreasing
frequency
.

Even
after
early
detection
and
prompt
treatment
,
41
%
of
cases
of
uveitis
did
not
respond
to
more
than
six
months
of
intensive
topical
treatment
with
corticosteroids
and
mydriatics
.

Despite
this
,
there
was
a
dramatic
decrease
in
the
50
%
incidence
of
blinding
complications
of
uveitis
cited
in
earlier
studies
.

Cataract
and
band
keratopathy
occurred
in
only
22
and
13
%
of
our
group
,
respectively
.

We
used
chloroquine
or
hydroxychloroquine
in
173
of
210
cases
and
found
only
one
case
of
chorioretinopathy
attributable
to
these
drugs
.

Systemically
administered
corticosteroids
were
used
in
75
of
210
cases
;
a
significant
number
of
posterior
subcapsular
cataracts
was
found
.

Typical
keratoconjunctivitis
sicca
developed
in
three
of
the
uveitis
cases
.

This
association
with
uveitis
and
JRA
was
not
noted
previously
.

Surgical
treatment
of
cataracts
,
band
keratopathy
,
and
glaucoma
achieved
uniformly
discouraging
results
.

Water
intoxication
associated
with
oxytocin
administration
during
saline
-
induced
abortion
.

Four
cases
of
water
intoxication
in
connection
with
oxytocin
administration
during
saline
-
induced
abortions
are
described
.

The
mechanism
of
water
intoxication
is
discussed
in
regard
to
these
cases
.

Oxytocin
administration
during
midtrimester
-
induced
abortions
is
advocated
only
if
it
can
be
carried
out
under
careful
observations
of
an
alert
nursing
staff
,
aware
of
the
symptoms
of
water
intoxication
and
instructed
to
watch
the
diuresis
and
report
such
early
signs
of
the
syndrome
as
asthenia
,
muscular
irritability
,
or
headaches
.

The
oxytocin
should
be
given
only
in
Ringers
lactate
or
,
alternately
,
in
Ringers
lactate
and
a
5
per
cent
dextrose
and
water
solutions
.

The
urinary
output
should
be
monitored
and
the
oxytocin
administration
discontinued
and
the
serum
electrolytes
checked
if
the
urinary
output
decreases
.

The
oxytocin
should
not
be
administered
in
excess
of
36
hours
.

If
the
patient
has
not
aborted
by
then
the
oxytocin
should
be
discontinued
for
10
to
12
hours
in
order
to
perform
electrolyte
determinations
and
correct
any
electrolyte
imbalance
.

Famotidine
-associated
delirium
.

A
series
of
six
cases
.

Famotidine
is
a
histamine
H2-receptor
antagonist
used
in
inpatient
settings
for
prevention
of
stress
ulcers
and
is
showing
increasing
popularity
because
of
its
low
cost
.

Although
all
of
the
currently
available
H2-receptor
antagonists
have
shown
the
propensity
to
cause
delirium
,
only
two
previously
reported
cases
have
been
associated
with
famotidine
.

The
authors
report
on
six
cases
of
famotidine
-associated
delirium
in
hospitalized
patients
who
cleared
completely
upon
removal
of
famotidine
.

The
pharmacokinetics
of
famotidine
are
reviewed
,
with
no
change
in
its
metabolism
in
the
elderly
population
seen
.

The
implications
of
using
famotidine
in
elderly
persons
are
discussed
.

Indomethacin
induced

hypotension
in
sodium
and
volume
depleted
rats
.

After
a
single
oral
dose
of
4
mg
/
kg
indomethacin

(
IDM
)
to

sodium
and
volume
depleted
rats
plasma
renin
activity
(
PRA
)
and

systolic
blood
pressure
fell
significantly
within
four
hours
.

In
sodium
repleted
animals
indomethacin
did
not
change
systolic
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
although
plasma
renin
activity
was
decreased
.

Thus
,
indomethacin
by
inhibition
of
prostaglandin
synthesis
may
diminish
the
blood
pressure
maintaining
effect
of
the
stimulated
renin-
angiotensin
system
in
sodium
and
volume
depletion
.

Late
-
onset

scleroderma
renal
crisis
induced
by
tacrolimus
and
prednisolone
:
a
case
report
.

Scleroderma
renal
crisis

(
SRC
)
is
a
rare
complication
of
systemic
sclerosis

(
SSc
)
but
can
be
severe
enough
to
require
temporary
or
permanent
renal
replacement
therapy
.

Moderate
to
high
dose
corticosteroid
use
is
recognized
as
a
major
risk
factor
for
SRC
.

Furthermore
,
there
have
been
reports
of
thrombotic
microangiopathy
precipitated
by
cyclosporine
in
patients
with
SSc
.

In
this
article
,
we
report
a
patient
with
SRC
induced
by
tacrolimus
and
corticosteroids
.

The
aim
of
this
work
is
to
call
attention
to
the
risk
of
tacrolimus
use
in
patients
with
SSc
.

The
risk
and
associated
factors
of
methamphetamine
psychosis
in
methamphetamine
-dependent
patients
in
Malaysia
.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
risk
of
lifetime
and
current

methamphetamine
-induced

psychosis
in
patients
with
methamphetamine
dependence
.

The
association
between
psychiatric
co
-
morbidity
and
methamphetamine
-induced
psychosis
was
also
studied
.

METHODS
:

This
was
a
cross
-
sectional
study
conducted
concurrently
at
a
teaching
hospital
and
a
drug
rehabilitation
center
in
Malaysia
.

Patients
with
the
diagnosis
of
methamphetamine
based
on
DSM
-
IV
were
interviewed
using
the
Mini
International
Neuropsychiatric
Interview
(
M.I.N.I.
)
for
methamphetamine
-induced
psychosis
and
other
Axis

I
psychiatric
disorders
.

The
information
on
sociodemographic
background
and
drug
use
history
was
obtained
from
interview
or
medical
records
.

RESULTS
:

Of
292
subjects
,
47.9
%
of
the
subjects
had
a
past
history
of
psychotic
symptoms
and
13.0
%
of
the
patients
were
having
current
psychotic
symptoms
.

)
and
heavy
methamphetamine
uses
were
significantly
associated
with
lifetime

methamphetamine
-induced

psychosis
after
adjusted
for
other
factors
.

Major
depressive
disorder

(
OR=2.870
,
CI=1.154

)
and
antisocial
personality
disorder
(
OR=3.299
,
95
CI=1.375
-
7.914
)
were
the
only
factors
associated
with
current
psychosis
.

CONCLUSION
:

There
was
a
high
risk
of
psychosis
in
patients
with
methamphetamine
dependence
.

It
was
associated
with
co
-
morbid
affective
disorder
,
antisocial
personality
,
and
heavy
methamphetamine
use
.

It
is
recommended
that
all
cases
of

Cerebellar
sensory
processing
alterations
impact
motor
cortical
plasticity
in
Parkinson
's
disease
:
clues
from
dyskinetic
patients
.

The
plasticity
of
primary
motor
cortex
(
M1
)
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
and
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
(
LIDs
)
is
severely
impaired
.

We
recently
reported
in
young
healthy
subjects
that
inhibitory
cerebellar
stimulation
enhanced
the
sensorimotor
plasticity
of
M1
that
was
induced
by
paired
associative
stimulation
(
PAS
)
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
the
deficient
sensorimotor
M1
plasticity
in
16
patients
with
LIDs
could
be
reinstated
by
a
single
session
of
real
inhibitory
cerebellar
stimulation
but
not
sham
stimulation
.

This
was
evident
only
when
a
sensory
component
was
involved
in
the
induction
of
plasticity
,
indicating
that
cerebellar
sensory
processing
function
is
involved
in
the
resurgence
of
M1
plasticity
.

The
benefit
of
inhibitory
cerebellar
stimulation
on
LIDs
is
known
.

To
explore
whether
this
benefit
is
linked
to
the
restoration
of
sensorimotor
plasticity
of
M1
,
we
conducted
an
additional
study
looking
at
changes
in
LIDs
and

PAS
-
induced
plasticity
after
10
sessions
of
either
bilateral
,
real
inhibitory
cerebellar
stimulation
or
sham
stimulation
.

Only
real
and
not
sham
stimulation
had
an
antidyskinetic
effect
and
it
was
paralleled
by
a
resurgence
in
the
sensorimotor
plasticity
of
M1
.

These
results
suggest
that
alterations
in
cerebellar
sensory
processing
function
,
occurring
secondary
to
abnormal
basal
ganglia
signals
reaching
it
,
may
be
an
important
element
contributing
to
the
maladaptive
sensorimotor
plasticity
of
M1
and
the
emergence
of
abnormal
involuntary
movements
.

The
function
of
P2X3
receptor
and
NK1
receptor
antagonists
on
cyclophosphamide
-induced
cystitis
in
rats
.

PURPOSE
:

The
purpose
of
the
study
is
to
explore
the
function
of
P2X3
and
NK1
receptors
antagonists
on
cyclophosphamide

(
CYP
)
-induced

cystitis
in
rats
.

METHODS
:

Sixty
female
Sprague
-
Dawley
(
SD
)
rats
were
randomly
divided
into
three
groups
.

The
rats
in
the
control
group
were
intraperitoneally
(
i.p
.
)
injected
with
0.9
%
saline
(
4
ml
/
kg
)
;
the
rats
in
the
model
group
were
i.p
.
injected
with
CYP

(
150
mg
/
kg
)
;
and
the
rats
in
the
intervention
group
were
i.p
.
injected
with
CYP
with
subsequently
perfusion
of
bladder
with
P2X3
and
NK1
receptors
'
antagonists
,
Suramin
and
GR
82334
.

Spontaneous
pain
behaviors
following
the
administration
of
CYP
were
observed
.

Urodynamic
parameters
,
bladder
pressure
-
volume
curve
,
maximum
voiding
pressure
(
MVP
)
,
and
maximum
cystometric
capacity
(
MCC
)
,
were
recorded
.

Pathological
changes
in
bladder
tissue
were
observed
.

Immunofluorescence
was
used
to
detect
the
expression
of
P2X3
and
NK1
receptors
in
bladder
.

RESULTS
:

Cyclophosphamide
treatment
increased
the
spontaneous
pain
behaviors
scores
.

The
incidence
of
bladder
instability
during
urine
storage
period
of
model
group
was
significantly
higher
than
intervention
group
(
X(2
)
=
7.619
,
P
=
0.007
)
and
control
group
(
X(2
)

=
13.755
,
P
=
0.000
)
.

MCC
in
the
model
group
was
lower
than
the
control
and
intervention
groups
(
P
0.01
)
.

Histological
changes
evident
in
model
and
intervention
groups
rats
'
bladder
included
edema
,
vasodilation
,
and
infiltration
of
inflammatory
cells
.

In
model
group
,
the
expression
of
P2X3
receptor
increased
in
urothelium
and
suburothelium
,
and
NK1
receptor
increased
in
suburothelium
,
while
the
expression
of
them
in
intervention
group
was
lower
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
CYP
-induced
cystitis
,
the
expression
of
P2X3
and
NK1
receptors
increased
in
urothelium
and/or
suburothelium
.

Perfusion

Acute
hepatitis
associated
with
clopidogrel
:
a
case
report
and
review
of
the
literature
.

Drug
-
induced

hepatotoxicity
is
a
common
cause
of
acute
hepatitis
,
and
the
recognition
of
the
responsible
drug
may
be
difficult
.

We
describe
a
case
of
clopidogrel
-related
acute
hepatitis
.

The
diagnosis
is
strongly
suggested
by
an
accurate
medical
history
and
liver
biopsy
.

Reports
about
cases
of
hepatotoxicity
due
to
clopidogrel
are
increasing
in
the
last
few
years
,
after
the
increased
use
of
this
drug
.

In
conclusion
,
we
believe
that
physicians
should
carefully
consider
the
risk
of
drug
-
induced
hepatic
injury
when
clopidogrel
is
prescribed
.

Pubertal
exposure
to
Bisphenol
A
increases

anxiety
-like
behavior
and
decreases
acetylcholinesterase
activity
of
hippocampus
in
adult
male
mice
.

The
negative
effects
of
Bisphenol
A

(
BPA
)
on
neurodevelopment
and
behaviors
have
been
well
established
.

Acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
is
a
regulatory
enzyme
which
is
involved
in

anxiety
-like
behavior
.

This
study
investigated
behavioral
phenotypes
and
AChE
activity
in
male
mice
following
BPA
exposure
during
puberty
.

On
postnatal
day
(
PND
)
35
,
male
mice
were
exposed
to
50
mg

BPA
/kg
diet
per
day
for
a
period
of
35
days
.

On
PND71
,
a
behavioral
assay
was
performed
using
the
elevated
plus
maze
(
EPM
)
and
the
light
/
dark
test
.

In
addition
,
AChE
activity
was
measured
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
hypothalamus
,
cerebellum
and
hippocampus
.

Results
from
our
behavioral
phenotyping
indicated
that
anxiety
-like
behavior
was
increased
in
mice
exposed
to
BPA
.

AChE
activity
was
significantly
decreased
in
the
hippocampus
of
mice
with
BPA
compared
to
control
mice
,
whereas
no
difference
was
found
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
hypothalamus
and
cerebellum
.

Our
findings
showed
that
pubertal
BPA
exposure
increased
anxiety
-like
behavior
,
which
may
be
associated
with
decreased
AChE
activity
of
the
hippocampus
in
adult
male
mice
.

Further
studies
are
necessary
to
investigate
the
cholinergic
signaling
of
the

problem
of
advanced
as
well
as

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
protective
effect
of
the
Solidago
virgaurea
extract
on

)
into
rats
twice
at
an
interval
of
24
h
,
for
two
consecutive
days
,
led
to
a
significant
increase
in
serum

,
creatine

,
alanine
transaminase
,

as
compared
to
the
normal

group
(
P

)
.

Pretreatment
with
S.
virgaurea
extract
for
5
weeks
at
a
dose
of
250
mg
/
kg
followed
by
isoproterenol
injection
significantly
prevented
the
observed
alterations
.

Captopril
(
50
mg
/

day
,
given
orally
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
angiotensin

-converting
enzyme
used
as
a
standard
cardioprotective
drug
,
was
used
as
a
positive
control
in
this
study
.

The
data
of
the
present
study
suggest
that
S.
virgaurea
extract
exerts
its
protective
effect
by
decreasing
MDA
level
and
increasing
the
antioxidant
status
in
isoproterenol
-treated

The
cytogenetic
action
of
ifosfamide
,
mesna
,
and
their
combination
on
peripheral
rabbit
lymphocytes
:
an
in
vivo
/
in
vitro
cytogenetic
study
.

Ifosfamide

(
IFO
)
is
an
alkylating
nitrogen
mustard
,
administrated
as
an
antineoplasmic
agent
.

It
is
characterized
by
its
intense
urotoxic
action
,
leading
to
hemorrhagic
cystitis
.

This
side
effect
of
IFO
raises
the
requirement
for
the
co
-
administration
with
sodium
2-sulfanylethanesulfonate

(
Mesna
)
aiming
to
avoid
or
minimize
this
effect
.

IFO
and
Mesna
were
administrated
separately
on
rabbit
's
lymphocytes
in
vivo
,
which
were
later
developed
in
vitro
.

Cytogenetic
markers
for
sister
chromatid
exchanges
(
SCEs
)
,
proliferation
rate
index
(
PRI
)
and
Mitotic
Index
were
recorded
.

Mesna
's
action
,
in
conjunction
with
IFO
reduces
the
frequency
of
SCEs
,
in
comparison
with
the
SCEs
recordings
obtained
when
IFO
is
administered
alone
.

In
addition
to
this
,
when
high
concentrations
of
Mesna
were
administered
alone
significant
reductions
of
the
PRI
were
noted
,
than
with
IFO
acting
at
the
same
concentration
on
the
lymphocytes
.

Mesna
significantly
reduces
IFO
's
genotoxicity
,
while
when
administered
in
high
concentrations
it
acts
in
an
inhibitory
fashion
on

Risk
factors
and
predictors
of

Malaysians
with
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Chronic
pulsatile
levodopa
therapy
for
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
leads
to
the
development
of
motor
fluctuations
and
dyskinesia
.

We
studied
the
prevalence
and
predictors
of
levodopa
-induced

dyskinesia
among
multiethnic
Malaysian
patients
with
PD
.

METHODS
:

This
is
a
cross
-
sectional
study
involving
95
patients
with
PD
on
uninterrupted
levodopa
therapy
for
at
least
6
months
.

The
instrument
used
was
the
UPDRS
questionnaires
.

The
predictors
of
dyskinesia
were
determined
using
multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
.

RESULTS
:

The
mean
age
was
65.6
+
8.5
years
.

The
mean
onset
age
was
58.5
+
9.8
years
.

The
median
disease
duration
was
6
(
7
)
years
.

Dyskinesia
was
present
in
44
%
(
n
=
42
)
with
median
levodopa
therapy
of
3
years
.

There
were
64.3
%
Chinese
,
31
%
Malays
,
and
3.7
%
Indians
and
other
ethnic
groups
.

Eighty
-
one
percent
of
patients
with
dyskinesia
had
clinical
fluctuations
.

Patients
with
dyskinesia
had
lower
onset
age
(
p
0.001
)
,
longer
duration
of
levodopa
therapy
(
p
0.001
)
,
longer
disease
duration
(
p
0.001
)
,
higher
total
daily
levodopa
dose
(
p
0.001
)
,
and
higher
total
UPDRS
scores
(
p
=
0.005
)
than
patients
without
dyskinesia
.

The
three
significant
predictors
of
dyskinesia
were
duration
of
levodopa
therapy
,
onset
age
,
and
total
daily
levodopa
dose
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
prevalence
of
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesia
in
our
patients
was
44
%
.

The
most
significant
predictors
were
duration
of
levodopa
therapy
,
total
daily
levodopa
dose
,
and
onset
age
.

An

An
investigation
of
the
pattern
of
kidney
injury
in
HIV
-
positive
persons
exposed
to
tenofovir
disoproxil
fumarate
:
an
examination
of
a
large
population
database
(
MHRA
database
)
.

The
potential
for
tenofovir
to
cause
a
range
of
kidney
syndromes
has
been
established
from
mechanistic
and
randomised
clinical
trials
.

However
,
the
exact
pattern
of
kidney
involvement
is
still
uncertain
.

We
undertook
a
descriptive
analysis
of
Yellow
Card
records
of
407
HIV
-
positive
persons
taking
tenofovir
disoproxil
fumarate

(
TDF
)
as
part
of
their
antiretroviral
therapy
regimen
and
submitted
to
the
Medicines
and
Healthcare
Products
Regulatory
Agency
(
MHRA
)
with
suspected
kidney
adverse
effects
.

Reports
that
satisfy
defined
criteria
were
classified
as
acute
kidney
injury
,
kidney
tubular
dysfunction
and
Fanconi
syndrome
.

Of
the
407
Yellow
Card
records
analysed
,
106
satisfied
criteria
for
TDF

-related

kidney
disease
,
of
which
53
(
50
%
)
had
features
of
kidney
tubular
dysfunction
,
35
(
33
%
)
were
found
to
have
features
of
glomerular
dysfunction
and
18

(
17
%
)
had
Fanconi
syndrome
.

The
median
TDF
exposure
was
316
days
(
interquartile
range
120
-
740
)
.

The
incidence
of
hospitalisation
for
TDF

kidney
adverse
effects
was
high
,
particularly
amongst
patients
with
features
of
Fanconi
syndrome
.

The
pattern
of
kidney
syndromes
in
this
population
series
mirrors
that
reported
in
randomised
clinical
trials
.

Cessation
of
TDF
was
associated
with
complete
restoration
of
kidney
function
in
up
half
of
the
patients
in
this
report
.

Incidence
of
postoperative
delirium
is
high
even
in
a
population
without
known
risk
factors
.

PURPOSE
:

Postoperative
delirium
is
a
recognized
complication
in
populations
at
risk
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
assess
the
prevalence
of
early
postoperative
delirium
in
a
population
without
known
risk
factors
admitted
to
the
ICU
for
postoperative
monitoring
after
elective
major
surgery
.

The
secondary
outcome
investigated
is
to
identify
eventual
independent
risk
factors
among
demographic
data
and
anesthetic
drugs
used
.

METHODS
:

An
observational
,
prospective
study
was
conducted
on
a
consecutive
cohort
of
patients
admitted
to
our
ICU
within
and
for
at
least
24
h
after
major
surgical
procedures
.

Exclusion
criteria
were
any
preexisting
predisposing
factor
for
delirium
or
other
potentially
confounding
neurological
dysfunctions
.

Patients
were
assessed
daily
using
the
confusion
assessment
method
for
the
ICU
scale
for
3
days
after
the
surgical
procedure
.

Early
postoperative
delirium
incidence
risk
factors
were
then
assessed
through
three
different
multiple
regression
models
.

RESULTS
:

According
to
the
confusion
assessment
method
for
the
ICU
scale
,
28
%
of
patients
were
diagnosed
with
early
postoperative
delirium
.

The
use
of
thiopentone
was
significantly
associated
with
an
eight
-
fold
-
higher
risk
for
delirium
compared
to
propofol
(
57.1
%
vs.
7.1
%
,
RR
=
8.0
,
X2

=
4.256
;
df
=
1
;
0.05
p
0.02
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
this
study
early
postoperative
delirium
was
found
to
be
a
very
common
complication
after
major
surgery
,
even
in
a
population
without
known
risk
factors
.

Thiopentone
was
independently
associated
with
an
increase
in
its
relative
risk
.

A
single
neurotoxic
dose
of

methamphetamine
induces
a
long
-
lasting
depressive
-like
behaviour
in
mice
.

Methamphetamine
(
METH
)
triggers
a
disruption
of
the
monoaminergic
system
and
METH
abuse
leads
to
negative
emotional
states
including
depressive
symptoms
during
drug
withdrawal
.

However
,
it
is
currently
unknown
if
the
acute
toxic
dosage
of
METH
also
causes
a
long
-
lasting
depressive
phenotype
and
persistent
monoaminergic
deficits
.

Thus
,
we
now
assessed
the
depressive
-like
behaviour
in
mice
at
early
and
long
-
term
periods
following
a
single
high
METH
dose
(
30
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
.

METH
did
not
alter
the
motor
function
and
procedural
memory
of
mice
as
assessed
by
swimming
speed
and
escape
latency
to
find
the
platform
in
a
cued
version
of
the
water
maze
task
.

However
,
METH
significantly
increased
the
immobility
time
in
the
tail
suspension
test
at
3
and
49
days
post
-
administration
.

This
depressive
-like
profile
induced
by
METH
was
accompanied
by
a
marked
depletion
of
frontostriatal
dopaminergic
and
serotonergic
neurotransmission
,
indicated
by
a
reduction
in
the
levels
of
dopamine
,
DOPAC
and
HVA
,
tyrosine
hydroxylase
and
serotonin
,
observed
at
both
3
and
49
days
post
-
administration
.

In
parallel
,
another
neurochemical
feature
of
depression
--astroglial
dysfunction
--
was
unaffected
in
the
cortex
and
the
striatal
levels
of
the
astrocytic
protein
marker
,
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
,
were
only
transiently
increased
at
3
days
.

These
findings
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
that
a
single
high
dose
of
METH
induces
long
-
lasting
depressive
-like
behaviour
in
mice
associated
with
a
persistent
disruption
of
frontostriatal
dopaminergic
and
serotonergic
homoeostasis
.

Linezolid
-induced
optic
neuropathy
.

Many
systemic
antimicrobials
have
been
implicated
to
cause
ocular
adverse
effects
.

This
is
especially
relevant
in
multidrug
therapy
where
more
than
one
drug
can
cause
a
similar
ocular
adverse
effect
.

We
describe
a
case
of
progressive
loss
of
vision
associated
with
linezolid
therapy
.

A
45-year
-
old
male
patient
who
was
on
treatment
with
multiple
second
-
line
anti
-
tuberculous
drugs
including
linezolid
and
ethambutol
for
extensively
drug
-
resistant
tuberculosis

(
XDR
-
TB
)
presented
to
us
with
painless
progressive
loss
of
vision
in
both
eyes
.

Color
vision
was
defective
and
fundus
examination
revealed
optic
disc
edema
in
both
eyes
.

Ethambutol
-induced

toxic
optic
neuropathy
was
suspected
and
tablet
ethambutol
was
withdrawn
.

Deterioration
of
vision
occurred
despite
withdrawal
of
ethambutol
.

Discontinuation
of
linezolid
resulted
in
marked
improvement
of
vision
.

Our
report
emphasizes
the
need
for
monitoring
of
visual
function
in
patients
on
long
-
term

treatment
.

(
LAST
)
.

METHODS
:

Newborn
piglets
received
levobupivacaine
until
cardiovascular
collapse
occurred
.

Standard
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
was
started
and
electrocardiogram
(
ECG
)
was
monitored
for
ventricular
tachycardia
,
fibrillation
,
or
QRS
prolongation
.

Piglets
were
then
randomly
allocated
to
four
groups
:
control
(
saline
)
,
Intralipid
(
)
alone
,
epinephrine
alone
,
or
a
combination
of
Intralipd
plus
epinephrine
.

Resuscitation
continued
for
30
min
or
until
there
was
a
return
of
spontaneous
circulation
(
ROSC
)
accompanied
by
a
mean
arterial
pressure
at
or
superior
to
the
baseline
pressure
and
normal
sinus
rhythm
for
a
period
of
30
min
.

RESULTS
:

ROSC
was
achieved
in
only
one
of
the
control
piglets
compared
with
most
of
the
treated
piglets
.

Mortality
was
not
significantly
different
between
the
three
treatment
groups
,
but
was
significantly
lower
in
all
the
treatment
groups
compared
with
control
.

The
number
of
ECG
abnormalities
was
zero
in
the
Intralipid
only
group
,
but
14
and
17
,
respectively
,
in
the
epinephrine
and
epinephrine
plus
lipid
groups
(
P<0.05
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Lipid
emulsion
with
or
without
epinephrine
,
or
epinephrine
alone
were
equally
effective
in
achieving
a
return
to
spontaneous
circulation
in
this
model
of
LAST
.

Epinephrine
alone
or
in
combination
with
lipid
was
associated
with
an
increased
number
of
ECG
abnormalities
compared
with
lipid
emulsion
alone
.

Incidence
of
heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
type
II
and
postoperative
recovery
of
platelet
count
in
liver
graft
recipients
:
a
retrospective
cohort
analysis
.

BACKGROUND
:

Thrombocytopenia
in
patients
with
end
-
stage
liver
disease
is
a
common
disorder
caused
mainly
by
portal
hypertension
,
low
levels
of
thrombopoetin
,
and
endotoxemia
.

The
impact
of
immune
-
mediated
heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
type
II
(
HIT
type
II
)
as
a
cause
of
thrombocytopenia

after
liver
transplantation
is
not
yet
understood
,
with
few
literature
citations
reporting
contradictory
results
.

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
demonstrate
the
perioperative
course
of
thrombocytopenia
after
liver
transplantation
and
determine
the
occurrence
of
clinical
HIT
type
II
.

METHOD
:

We
retrospectively
evaluated
the
medical
records
of
205
consecutive
adult
patients
who
underwent
full
-
size
liver
transplantation
between
January
2006
and
December
2010
due
to
end
-
stage
or
malignant
liver
disease
.

Preoperative
platelet
count
,
postoperative
course
of
platelets
,
and
clinical
signs
of
HIT
type
II
were
analyzed
.

RESULTS
:

A
total
of
155
(
75.6
%
)
of
205
patients
had
thrombocytopenia
before
transplantation
,
significantly
influenced
by
Model
of
End
-
Stage
Liver
Disease
score
and
liver
cirrhosis
.

The
platelet
count
exceeded
100,000/uL
in
most
of
the
patients
(
n
=
193
)
at
a
medium
of
7
d.
Regarding
HIT
II
,
there
were
four
(
1.95
%
)
patients
with
a
background
of
HIT
type
II
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
incidence
of
HIT
in
patients
with
end
-
stage
hepatic
failure
is
,
with
about
1.95
%
,
rare
.

For
further
reduction
of
HIT
type
II
,
the
use
of
intravenous
heparin
should
be
avoided
and
the
prophylactic
anticoagulation
should
be
performed
with
low
-
molecular
-
weight
heparin
after
normalization
of
platelet
count
.

Takotsubo
syndrome
(
or
apical
ballooning
syndrome
)
secondary
to
Zolmitriptan
.

Takotsubo
syndrome
(
TS
)
,
also
known
as
broken
heart
syndrome
,
is
characterized
by
left
ventricle
apical
ballooning
with
elevated
cardiac
biomarkers
and
electrocardiographic
changes
suggestive
of
an
acute
coronary
syndrome

(
ie
,
ST
-
segment
elevation
,
T
wave
inversions
,
and
pathologic
Q
waves
)
.

We
report
a
case
of
54-year
-
old
woman
with
medical
history
of
mitral
valve
prolapse
and
migraines
,
who
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
substernal

chest
pain
and
electrocardiogram
demonstrated
1/2
mm
ST
-
segment
elevation
in
leads
II
,
III
,
aVF
,
V5
,
and
V6
and
positive
troponin
I.
Emergent
coronary
angiogram
revealed
normal
coronary
arteries
with
moderately
reduced
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
with
wall
motion
abnormalities
consistent
with
TS
.

Detailed
history
obtained
retrospectively
revealed
that
the
patient
took
zolmitriptan
sparingly
only
when
she
had
migraines
.

But
before
this
event
,
she
was
taking

zolmitriptan
2
-
3
times
daily
for
several
days
because
of
a
persistent
migraine
headache
.

She
otherwise
reported
that
she
is
quite
active
,
rides
horses
,
and
does
show
jumping
without
any
limitations
in
her
physical
activity
.

There
was
no
evidence
of
any
recent
stress
or
status
migrainosus
.

Extensive
literature
search
revealed
multiple
cases
of
coronary
artery
vasospasm
secondary
to
zolmitriptan
,
but
none
of
the
cases
were
associated
with
TS
.

Depression

)
.

RATIONALE
:

Ecstasy

(
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
,
MDMA
)
is
a
worldwide
recreational
drug
of
abuse
.

Unfortunately
,
the
results
from
human
research
investigating
its
psychological
effects
have
been
inconsistent
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
present
study
aimed
to
be
the
largest
to
date
in
sample
size
and
5HT
-
related
behaviors
;
the
first
to
compare
present
ecstasy
users
with
past
users
after
an
abstinence
of
4
or
more
years
,
and
the
first
to
include
robust
controls
for
other
recreational
substances
.

METHODS
:

A
sample
of
997
participants
(
52
%
male
)
was
recruited
to
four
control
groups
(
non
-
drug
(
ND
)
,
alcohol
/
nicotine

(
AN
)
,
cannabis
/
alcohol
/
nicotine

(
CAN
)
,
non-
ecstasy
polydrug
(
PD
)
)
,
and
two
ecstasy
polydrug
groups
(
present
(
MDMA
)
and
past
users
(
EX-
MDMA
)
.

Participants
completed
a
drug
history
questionnaire
,
Beck
Depression
Inventory
,
Barratt
Impulsiveness
Scale
,
Pittsburgh
Sleep
Quality
Index
,
and
Wechsler
Memory
Scale

-
Revised
which
,
in
total
,
provided
13
psychometric
measures
.

RESULTS
:

While
the
CAN
and
PD
groups
tended
to
record
greater
deficits
than
the
non
-
drug
controls
,
the
MDMA
and
EX-
MDMA
groups
recorded
greater
deficits
than
all
the
control
groups
on
ten
of
the
13
psychometric
measures
.

Strikingly
,
despite
prolonged
abstinence
(
mean
,
4.98
;
range
,
4
-
9
years
)
,
past
ecstasy
users
showed
few
signs
of
recovery
.

Compared
with
present
ecstasy
users
,
the
past
users
showed
no
change
for
ten
measures
,
increased
impairment
for
two
measures
,
and
improvement
on
just
one
measure
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Given
this
record
of
impaired
memory
and
clinically
significant
levels
of
depression
,
impulsiveness
,
and
sleep
disturbance
,
the
prognosis
for
the
current
generation
of
ecstasy
users
is
a
major
cause
for
concern
.

Association
of
common
genetic
variants
of
HOMER1
gene
with
levodopa
adverse
effects
in
Parkinson
's
disease
patients
.

Levodopa
is
the
most
effective
symptomatic
therapy
for
Parkinson
's
disease
,
but
its
chronic
use
could
lead
to
chronic
adverse
outcomes
,
such
as
motor
fluctuations
,
dyskinesia
and
visual
hallucinations
.

HOMER1
is
a
protein
with
pivotal
function
in
glutamate
transmission
,
which
has
been
related
to
the
pathogenesis
of
these
complications
.

This
study
investigates
whether
polymorphisms
in
the
HOMER1
gene
promoter
region
are
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
the
chronic
complications
of
levodopa
therapy
.

A
total
of
205
patients
with
idiopathic
Parkinson
's
disease
were
investigated
.

Patients
were
genotyped
for
rs4704559
,
rs10942891
and
rs4704560
by
allelic
discrimination
with
Taqman
assays
.

The
rs4704559
G
allele
was
associated
with
a
lower
prevalence
of
dyskinesia

(
prevalence
ratio
(
PR)=0.615
,
95
%
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
0.426
-
0.887
,
P=0.009
)
and
visual
hallucinations

(
PR=0.515
,
95
%
CI
0.295
-
0.899
,
P=0.020
)
.

Our
data
suggest
that
HOMER1
rs4704559
G
allele
has
a
protective
role
for
the
development
of
levodopa
adverse
effects
.

Crocin
improves
lipid
dysregulation
in
subacute
diazinon
exposure
through
ERK1/2
pathway
in
rat
liver
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Diazinon

Yis
one
of
the
most
broadly
used
organophosphorus
insecticides
in
agriculture
.

It
has
been
shown
that
exposure
to
diazinon
may
interfere
with
lipid
metabolism
.

Moreover
,
the
hypolipidemic
effect
of
crocin
has
been
established
.

Earlier
studies
revealed
the
major
role
of
Extracellular
signal
-
regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
pathways
in
low
-
density
lipoprotein
receptor
(
LDLr
)
expression
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
changes
in
the
regulation
of
lipid
metabolism
,
ERK
and
LDLr
expression
in
the
liver
of
rats
exposed
to
subacute
diazinon
.

Furthermore
ameliorating
effect
of
crocin
on
diazinon
induced
disturbed
cholesterol
homeostasis
was
studied
.

METHODS
:
24
Rats
were
divided
into
4
groups
and
received
following
treatments
for
4
weeks
;
Corn
oil
(
control
)
,
diazinon
(
15mg
/
kg
per
day
,
orally
)
and
crocin
(
12.5
and
25mg
/
kg
per
day
,
intraperitoneally
)
in
combination
with
diazinon

(
15
mg
/
kg
)
.

The
levels
of
cholesterol
,

triglyceride
and
LDL
in
blood
of
rats
were
analyzed
.

Moreover
mRNA
levels
of
LDLr
and
ERK1/2
as
well
as
protein
levels
of
total
and
activated
forms
of
ERK1/2
in
rat
liver
were
evaluated
by
Western
blotting
and
quantitative
real
time
polymerase
chain
reaction
analysis
.

RESULTS
:

Our
data
showed
that
subacute
exposure
to
diazinon
significantly
increased
concentrations
of
cholesterol
,
triglyceride
and
LDL
.

Moreover
diazinon
decreased
ERK1/2
protein
phosphorylation
and
LDLr
transcript
.

Crocin
reduced
inhibition
of
ERK
activation
and

diazinon
-induced

hyperlipemia
and
increased
levels
of
LDLr
transcript
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Crocin
may
be
considered
as
a
novel
protective
agent
in
diazinon
-induced
hyperlipemia
through
modulating
of
ERK
pathway
and
increase
of
LDLr
expression
.

GEM
-P
chemotherapy
is
active
in
the
treatment
of
relapsed
Hodgkin
lymphoma
.

Hodgkin
lymphoma

(
HL
)
is
a
relatively
chemosensitive
malignancy
.

However
,
for
those
who
relapse
,
high
-
dose
chemotherapy
with
autologous
stem
cell
transplant
is
the
treatment
of
choice
which
relies
on
adequate
disease
control
with
salvage
chemotherapy
.

Regimens
commonly
used
often
require
inpatient
administration
and
can
be
difficult
to
deliver
due
to
toxicity
.

Gemcitabine
and
cisplatin
have
activity
in
HL
,
non

chemotherapeutics
,
and
may
be
delivered
in

were
included
.

Demographic

data
were
recorded
.

Forty

were
identified
:
median

were
administered
in

and
thrombocytopenia
51
%
.

Median

Basal
functioning
of
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary

adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
and
psychological
distress
in
recreational
ecstasy
polydrug
users
.

RATIONALE
:

Ecstasy

(
MDMA
)
is
a
psychostimulant
drug
which
is
increasingly
associated
with
psychobiological
dysfunction
.

While
some
recent
studies
suggest
acute
changes
in
neuroendocrine
function
,
less
is
known
about
long
-
term
changes
in
HPA
functionality
in
recreational
users
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
current
study
is
the
first
to
explore
the
effects
of
ecstasy
-polydrug
use
on
psychological
distress
and
basal
functioning
of
the
HPA
axis
through
assessing
the
secretion
of
cortisol
across
the
diurnal
period
.

METHOD
:

Seventy
-
six
participants
(
21
nonusers
,
29
light
ecstasy
-polydrug
users
,
26
heavy
ecstasy
-polydrug
users
)
completed
a
substance
use
inventory
and
measures
of
psychological
distress
at
baseline
,
then
two
consecutive
days
of
cortisol
sampling
(
on
awakening
,
30
min
post
awakening
,
between
1400
and
1600
hours
and
pre
bedtime
)
.

On
day
2
,
participants
also
attended
the
laboratory
to
complete
a
20-min
multitasking
stressor
.

RESULTS
:

Both
user
groups
exhibited
significantly
greater
levels
of
anxiety
and
depression
than
nonusers
.

On
day
1
,
all
participants
exhibited
a
typical
cortisol
profile
,
though
light
users
had
significantly
elevated
levels
pre
-
bed
.

On
day
2
,
heavy
users
demonstrated
elevated
levels
upon
awakening
and
all
ecstasy
-polydrug
users
demonstrated
elevated
pre
-
bed
levels
compared
to
non
-
users
.

Significant
between
group
differences
were
also
observed
in
afternoon
cortisol
levels
and
in
overall
cortisol
secretion
across
the
day
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
increases
in
anxiety
and
depression
are
in
line
with
previous
observations
in
recreational
ecstasy
-polydrug
users
.

Dysregulated
diurnal

cortisol
may
be
indicative
of
inappropriate
anticipation
of
forthcoming
demands
and
hypersecretion
may
lead
to
the
increased
psychological
and
physical
morbidity
associated
with
heavy
recreational
use
of
ecstasy
.

Ifosfamide
related
encephalopathy
:
the
need
for
a
timely
EEG
evaluation
.

BACKGROUND
:

Ifosfamide
is
an
alkylating
agent
useful
in
the
treatment
of
a
wide
range
of
cancers
including
sarcomas
,
lymphoma
,
gynecologic
and
testicular
cancers
.

Encephalopathy
has
been
reported
in
10
-
40
%
of
patients
receiving
high
-
dose
IV
ifosfamide
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
highlight
the
role
of
electroencephalogram
(
EEG
)
in
the
early
detection
and
management
of

ifosfamide
related
encephalopathy
.

METHODS
:

Retrospective
chart
review
including
clinical
data
and
EEG
recordings
was
done
on
five
patients
,
admitted
to
MD
Anderson
Cancer
Center
between
years
2009
and
2012
,
who
developed
ifosfamide
related
acute
encephalopathy
.

RESULTS
:

All
five
patients
experienced
symptoms
of
encephalopathy
soon
after
(
within
12
h-2
days
)
receiving
ifosfamide
.

Two
patients
developed
generalized
convulsions
while
one
patient
developed
continuous
non
-
convulsive
status
epilepticus

(
NCSE
)
that
required
ICU
admission
and
intubation
.

Initial
EEG
showed
epileptiform
discharges
in
three
patients

.

Mixed
pattern
with
the
presence
of
both

were
also
noted
.

Repeat
EEGs
within
24_h
of

CONCLUSIONS
:

Severity
of
ifosfamide
related
encephalopathy
correlates
with

changes
.

We
suggest
a
timely
EEG
evaluation
for
patients
receiving
ifosfamide
who
develop
features
of
encephalopathy
.

Incidence
of
contrast
-induced
nephropathy
in
hospitalised
patients
with
cancer
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
determine
the
frequency
of
and
possible
factors
related
to
contrast
-induced
nephropathy
(
CIN
)
in
hospitalised
patients
with
cancer
.

METHODS
:

Ninety
adult
patients
were
enrolled
.

Patients
with
risk
factors
for
acute
renal
failure
were
excluded
.

Blood
samples
were
examined
the
day
before
contrast
-enhanced
computed
tomography
(
CT
)
and
serially
for
3
days
thereafter
.

CIN
was
defined
as
an
increase
in
serum
creatinine

(
Cr
)
of
0.5
mg
/
dl
or
more
,
or
elevation
of
Cr
to
25
%
over
baseline
.

Relationships
between
CIN
and
possible
risk
factors
were
investigated
.

RESULTS
:

CIN
was
detected
in
18/90
(
20
%
)
patients
.

CIN
developed
in
25.5
%
patients
who
underwent
chemotherapy
and
in
11
%
patients
who
did
not
(
P
=
0.1
)
.

CIN
more
frequently
developed
in
patients
who
had
undergone
CT
within
45
days
after
the
last
chemotherapy
(
P
=
0.005
)
;
it
was
also
an
independent
risk
factor
(
P
=
0.017
)
.

CIN
was
significantly
more
after
treatment
with
bevacizumab
/
irinotecan
(
P
=
0.021
)

and
in
patients
with
hypertension

(
P
=
0.044
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
incidence
of
CIN
after
CT
in
hospitalised
oncological
patients
was
20
%
.

CIN
developed
4.5-times
more
frequently
in
patients
with
cancer
who
had
undergone
recent
chemotherapy
.

Hypertension
and
the
combination
of
bevacizumab
/
irinotecan
may
be
additional
risk
factors
for
CIN
development
.

KEY
POINTS
:
.

Contrast
-induced

nephropathy

(
CIN
)
is
a
concern
for
oncological
patients
undergoing
CT
.
.

CIN
occurs
more
often
when
CT
is
performed
45
days
after
chemotherapy
.
.

Hypertension
and
treatment
with
bevacizumab
appear
to
be
additional
risk
factors
.

Syndrome
of
inappropriate
antidiuretic
hormone
secretion
associated
with
desvenlafaxine
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
syndrome
of
inappropriate
anti
-
diuretic
hormone

(
SIADH
)
secretion
associated
with
desvenlafaxine
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
57-year
old
female
with
hyponatraemia
.

Her
medications
included
desvenlafaxine
,
and
symptoms
included
nausea
,
anxiety
and
confusion
.

The
serum
sodium
at
this
time
was
120
mmol
/
L
,
serum
osmolality
was
263
mosmol
/
kg
,
urine
osmolality
410
mosmol
/
kg
and
urine
sodium

63
mmol
/
L
,
consistent
with
a
diagnosis
of
SIADH
.

Desvenlafaxine
was
ceased
and
fluid
restriction
implemented
.

After
4
days
the
sodium
increased
to
128
mmol
/
L
and
fluid
restriction
was
relaxed
.

During
her
further
3
weeks
inpatient
admission
the
serum
sodium
ranged
from
134
to
137
mmol
/
L
during
treatment
with
mirtazapine
.

DISCUSSION
:

SIADH
has
been
widely
reported
with
a
range
of
antidepressants
.

This
case
report
suggests
that
desvenlafaxine
might
cause
clinically
significant
hyponatremia
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Clinicians
should
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
antidepressants
to
cause
hyponatremia
,
and
take
appropriate
corrective
action
where
necessary
.

Oxidative
stress
on
cardiotoxicity
after
treatment
with
single
and
multiple
doses
of
doxorubicin
.

The
mechanism
of
doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
-induced

cardiotoxicity
remains
controversial
.

Wistar
rats
(
n
=
66
)
received
DOX
injections
intraperitoneally
and
were
randomly
assigned
to
2
experimental
protocols
:
(
1
)
rats
were
killed
before
(
-24
h
,
n
=
8)
and
24
h
after
(
+
24
h
,
n
=
8)
a
single
dose
of
DOX

(
4
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
to
determine
the
DOX
acute
effect
and
(
2
)
rats
(
n
=
58
)
received
4
injections
of
DOX

(
4
mg
/
kg
body
weight
/
week
)
and
were
killed
before
the
first
injection
(
M0
)
and
1
week
after
each
injection
(
M1
,
M2
,
M3
,
and
M4
)
to
determine
the
chronological
effects
.

Animals
used
at
M0
(
n
=
8)
were
also
used
at
moment
-24
h
of
acute
study
.

Cardiac
total
antioxidant
performance
(
TAP
)
,
DNA
damage
,
and
morphology
analyses
were
carried
out
at
each
time
point
.

Single
dose
of
DOX
was
associated
with
increased
cardiac
disarrangement
,
necrosis
,
and
DNA
damage
(
strand
breaks
(
SBs
)
and
oxidized
pyrimidines
)
and
decreased
TAP
.

The
chronological
study
showed
an
effect
of
a
cumulative
dose
on
body
weight
(
R
=
-0.99
,
p
=
0.011
)
,
necrosis

(
R
=
1.00
,
p
=
0.004
)
,
TAP
(
R
=
0.95
,

p
=
0.049
)
,
and
DNA
SBs
(
R
=
-0.95
,
p
=
0.049
)
.

DNA
SBs
damage
was
negatively
associated
with
TAP
(
R
=
-0.98
,
p
=
0.018
)
,
and
necrosis
(
R
=
-0.97
,
p
=
0.027
)
.

Our
results
suggest
that
oxidative
damage
is
associated
with
acute
cardiotoxicity
induced
by
a
single
dose
of
DOX
only
.

Increased
resistance
to
the
oxidative
stress
is
plausible
for
the
multiple
dose
of
DOX
.

Thus
,
different
mechanisms
may
be
involved
in
acute
toxicity
versus
chronic
toxicity
.

Tacrolimus
-related
seizure
after
pediatric
liver
transplantation
--
a
single
-
center
experience
.

To
identify
the
risk
factors
for
new
-
onset
seizures
after
pediatric
LT
and
to
assess
their
clinical
implications
and
long
-
term
prognosis
.

The
clinical
and
laboratory
data
of
27
consecutive
children
who
underwent
LT
from
January
2007
to
December
2010
in
our
center
were
analyzed
retrospectively
.

Patients
were
divided
into
seizures
group
and
a
non-
seizures
group
.

Pre
-
operative
,
intra
-
operative
,
and
post
-
operative
data
were
collected
.

Seizures
occurred
in
four
children
,
an
incidence
of
14.8
%
.

All
exhibited
generalized
tonic
-
clonic
seizures
within
the
first
two
wk
after
LT
.

Univariate
analysis
showed
that
the
risk
factors
associated
with
seizures

after
pediatric
LT
included
gender
,
pediatric
end
-
stage
liver
disease
score
before
surgery
,
Child
-
Pugh
score
before
surgery
,
serum
total

bilirubin
after
surgery
,
and
trough
TAC
level
.

Multivariate
analysis
showed
that
trough
TAC
level
was
the
only
independent
risk
factor
associated
with
the
seizures
.

All
children
who
experienced
seizures
survived
with
good
graft
function
and
remained

seizure
-free
without
anti-
epileptic
drugs
over
a
mean
follow
-
up
period
of
33.7
+
14.6
months
.

High
trough
TAC

level
was
the
predominant
factor
that
contributed
to
seizures
in
the
early
post
-
operative
period
after
pediatric
LT
.

High
PELD
and
Child
-
Pugh
scores
before
LT
and
high
post
-
operative
serum
Tbil
may
be
contributory
risk
factors
for
TAC

-related

seizures
.

The
flavonoid
apigenin
delays
forgetting
of
passive
avoidance
conditioning
in
rats
.

The
present
experiments
were
performed
to
study
the
effect
of
the
flavonoid
apigenin

(
20
mg
/
kg
intraperitoneally
(
i.p
.
)
,
1
h
before
acquisition
)
,
on
24
h
retention
performance
and
forgetting
of
a
step
-
through
passive
avoidance
task
,
in
young
male
Wistar
rats
.

There
were
no
differences
between
saline-
and
apigenin
-treated
groups
in
the
24
h
retention
trial
.

Furthermore
,
apigenin
did
not
prevent
the
amnesia
induced
by
scopolamine

(
1mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
,
30
min
before
the
acquisition
)
.

The
saline-
and
apigenin
-treated
rats
that
did
not
step
through
into
the
dark
compartment
during
the
cut
-
off
time
(
540
s
)
were
retested
weekly
for
up
to
eight
weeks
.

In
the
saline
treated
group
,
the
first
significant
decline
in
passive
avoidance
response
was
observed
at
four
weeks
,
and
complete

memory
loss
was
found
five
weeks
after
the
acquisition
of
the
passive
avoidance
task
.

At
the
end
of
the
experimental
period
,
60
%
of
the
animals
treated
with
apigenin
still
did
not
step
through
.

These
data
suggest
that
1
)
apigenin
delays
the
long
-
term
forgetting
but
did
not
modulate
the
24
h
retention
of
fear
memory
and
2
)

the
obtained
beneficial
effect
of
apigenin
on
the
passive
avoidance
conditioning
is
mediated
by
mechanisms
that
do
not
implicate
its
action
on
the
muscarinic
cholinergic
system
.

Cholecystokinin
-
octapeptide
restored

morphine
-induced
hippocampal
long
-
term
potentiation
impairment
in
rats
.

Cholecystokinin
-
octapeptide
(
CCK-8
)
,
which
is
a
typical
brain
-
gut
peptide
,
exerts
a
wide
range
of
biological
activities
on
the
central
nervous
system
.

We
have
previously
reported
that
CCK-8
significantly
alleviated
morphine
-induced
amnesia
and
reversed
spine
density
decreases
in
the
CA1
region
of
the
hippocampus
in

morphine
-treated
animals
.

Here
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
CCK-8
on
long
-
term
potentiation
(
LTP
)
in
the
lateral
perforant
path
(
LPP)-granule
cell
synapse
of
rat
dentate
gyrus
(
DG
)
in
acute
saline
or
morphine
-treated
rats
.

Population
spikes
(
PS
)
,
which
were
evoked
by
stimulation
of
the
LPP
,
were
recorded
in
the
DG
region
.

Acute
morphine

(
30mg
/
kg
,
s.c
.
)

treatment
significantly
attenuated
hippocampal
LTP
and
CCK-8
(
1ug
,
i.c.v
.
)
restored
the
amplitude
of
PS
that
was
attenuated
by
morphine
injection
.

Furthermore
,
microinjection
of
CCK-8
(
0.1
and
1ug
,
i.c.v
.
)

also
significantly
augmented
hippocampal
LTP
in
saline
-
treated
(
1ml
/
kg
,
s.c
.
)

rats
.

Pre
-
treatment
of
the
CCK2
receptor
antagonist
L-365,260
(
10ug
,
i.c.v
)
reversed
the
effects
of
CCK-8
,
but
the
CCK1
receptor
antagonist
L-364,718
(
10ug
,
i.c.v
)
did
not
.

The
present
results
demonstrate
that
CCK-8
attenuates
the
effect
of
morphine
on
hippocampal
LTP
through
CCK2
receptors
and
suggest
an
ameliorative
function
of
CCK-8
on
morphine

.

Glial
activation
and
post

synaptic
neurotoxicity
:

the
key
events
in
Streptozotocin
(
ICV
)
induced
memory
impairment
in
rats
.

In
the
present
study
the
role
of
glial
activation
and
post
synaptic
toxicity
in
ICV
Streptozotocin

(
STZ
)
induced
memory
impaired
rats
was
explored
.

In
experiment
set
up
1
:
Memory
deficit
was
found
in
Morris
water
maze
test
on
14
-
16
days
after
STZ
(
ICV
;
3mg
/
Kg
)
administration
.

STZ
causes
increased
expression
of
GFAP
,
CD11b
and
TNF
-
a
indicating
glial
activation
and
neuroinflammation
.

STZ
also
significantly
increased
the
level
of
ROS
,
nitrite
,
Ca
(
2
+
)
and
reduced
the
mitochondrial
activity
in
synaptosomal
preparation
illustrating
free
radical
generation
and
excitotoxicity
.

Increased
expression
and
activity
of
Caspase-3
was
also
observed
in
STZ

treated
rat
which
specify
apoptotic
cell
death
in
hippocampus
and
cortex
.

STZ
treatment
showed
decrease
expression
of
post
synaptic
markers
CaMKIIa
and
PSD-95
,
while
,
expression
of
pre
synaptic
markers
(
synaptophysin
and
SNAP-25
)
remains
unaltered
indicating
selective
post
synaptic
neurotoxicity
.

Oral
treatment
with
Memantine

(
10mg
/
kg
)
and
Ibuprofen

(
50
mg
/
kg
)
daily
for
13
days
attenuated

STZ
induced
glial
activation
,
apoptotic
cell

and
post
synaptic
neurotoxicity
in
rat
brain
.

Further
,
in
experiment
set
up
2
:
where
memory
function
was
not
affected
i.e.
7
-
9
days
after
STZ
treatment
.

The
level
of
GFAP
,
CD11b
,
TNF
-
a
,
ROS
and
nitrite
levels
were
increased
.

On
the
other
hand
,
apoptotic
marker
,
synaptic
markers
,
mitochondrial
activity
and
Ca
(
2
+
)
levels
remained
unaffected
.

Collective
data
indicates
that
neuroinflammatory
process
and
oxidative
stress
occurs
earlier
to
apoptosis
and
does
not
affect
memory
function
.

Present
study
clearly
suggests
that
glial
activation
and
post
synaptic
neurotoxicity
are
the
key
factors
in
STZ
induced
memory
impairment
and
neuronal
cell
death
.

Comparison
of

.

INTRODUCTION
AND
OBJECTIVE
:

Contrast
-induced

nephropathy

(
CIN
)
significantly
increases
the
morbidity
and
mortality
of
patients
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
and
compare
the
protective
effects
of
isotonic
sodium
chloride
with
sodium
bicarbonate
infusion
and
isotonic
sodium
chloride
infusion
with
diltiazem
,
a
calcium
channel
blocker
,
in
preventing
CIN
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

Our
study
included
patients
who
were
administered
30
-
60
mL
of
iodinated
contrast
agent
for
percutaneous
coronary
angiography
(
PCAG
)
,
all
with
creatinine
values
between
1.1
and
3.1
mg
/
dL.
Patients
were
divided
into
three
groups
and
each
group
had
20
patients
.

The
first
group
of
patients
was
administered
isotonic
sodium
chloride
;
the
second
group
was
administered
a
solution
that
of
5
%
dextrose
and
sodium
bicarbonate
,
while
the
third
group
was
administered
isotonic
sodium
chloride
before
and
after
the
contrast
injection
.

The
third
group
received
an
additional
injection
of
diltiazem
the
day
before
and
first
2
days
after
the
contrast
injection
.

All
of
the
patients
'
plasma
blood
urea
nitrogen

(
BUN
)
and
creatinine
levels
were
measured
on
the
second
and
seventh
day
after
the
administration
of
intravenous
contrast
material
.

RESULTS
:

The
basal
creatinine
levels
were
similar
for
all
three
groups
(
p
>
0.05
)
.

Among
a
total
of
60
patients
included
in
the
study
,
16
patients
developed
acute
renal
failure

(
ARF
)
on
the
second
day
after
contrast
material
was
injected
(
26.6
%
)
.

The
number
of
patients
who
developed
ARF
on
the
second
day
after
the
injection
in
the
first
group
was
five
(
25
%
)
,
in
the
second
group
was
six
(
30
%
)
and
the
third
group
was
five
(
25
%
)
(
p
>
0.05
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

There
was
no
significant
difference
between
isotonic
sodium
chloride
,
sodium
bicarbonate
and
isotonic
sodium
chloride
with
diltiazem
application
in

Group
.

Concerns
about
long
-
term
methotrexate

(
MTX
)

neurotoxicity
in
the
1990s
led
to
modifications
in
intrathecal

IT
)
therapy
,
leucovorin
rescue
,
and
frequency
of
systemic
MTX
administration
in
children
with

.

In
this
study
,
neurocognitive
outcomes
and
neuroradiologic

were
enrolled
on

.

Significantly
more

developed

leukoencephalopathy
compared
with
P9201
patients
(

Overall
,
40
%
of
patients
scored

.

Children
on
both

This
supports
ongoing
concerns
about

as
a
major
contributor
to

.

Tranexamic
acid
overdosage
-
induced
generalized
seizure
in
renal
failure
.

We
report
a
45-year
-
old
lady
with
chronic
kidney
disease
stage
4
due
to
chronic
tubulointerstial
disease
.

She
was
admitted
to
our
center
for
severe
anemia
due
to
menorrhagia
and
deterioration
of
renal
function
.

She
was
infused
three
units
of
packed
cells
during
a
session
of
hemodialysis
.

Tranexamic
acid

(
TNA
)

1
g
8-hourly
was
administered
to
her
to
control
bleeding
per
vaginum
.

Two
hours
after
the
sixth
dose
of
TNA
,
she
had
an
episode
of
generalized
tonic
clonic
convulsions
.

TNA
was
discontinued
.

Investigations
of
the
patient
revealed
no
biochemical
or
structural
central
nervous
system
abnormalities
that
could
have
provoked
the
convulsions
.

She
did
not
require
any
further
dialytic
support
.

She
had
no
further
episodes
of
convulsion
till
dis
-
charge
and
during
the
two
months
of
follow
-
up
.

Thus
,
the
precipitating
cause
of
convulsions
was
believed
to
be
an
overdose
of
TNA
.

Pre
-
treatment
of
bupivacaine
-induced
cardiovascular
depression
using
different
lipid
formulations
of
propofol
.

BACKGROUND
:

Pre
-
treatment
with
lipid
emulsions
has
been
shown
to
increase
lethal
doses
of
bupivacaine
,
and
the
lipid
content
of
propofol
may
alleviate
bupivacaine
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
the
effects
of
propofol
in
intralipid
or
medialipid
emulsions
on
bupivacaine

-induced

cardiotoxicity
.

METHODS
:
Rats
were
anaesthetised
with
ketamine
and
were
given
0.5
mg
/
kg
/
min
propofol
in
intralipid
(
Group
P
)
,
propofol
in
medialipid

(
Group
L
)
,
or
saline
(
Group
C
)
over
20
min
.

Thereafter
,
2
mg
/
kg
/
min
bupivacaine
0.5
%
was
infused
.

We
recorded
time
to
first
dysrhythmia
occurrence
,
respective
times
to
25
%
and
50
%
reduction
of
the
heart
rate
(
HR
)
and
mean
arterial
pressure
,
and
time
to
asystole
and
total
amount
of
bupivacaine
consumption
.

Blood
and
tissue
samples
were
collected
following
asystole
.

RESULTS
:

The
time
to
first
dysrhythmia
occurrence
,
time
to
25
%
and
50
%
reductions
in
HR
,
and
time
to
asystole
were
longer
in
Group
P
than
the
other
groups
.

The
cumulative
bupivacaine
dose
given
at
those
time
points
was
higher
in
Group
P.
Plasma
bupivacaine
levels
were
significantly
lower
in
Group
P
than
in
Group
C.
Bupivacaine
levels
in
the
brain
and
heart
were
significantly
lower
in
Group
P
and
Group
L

than
in
Group
C.
CONCLUSION
:

We
conclude
that
pre
-
treatment
with
propofol
in
intralipid
,
compared
with
propofol
in
medialipid
or
saline
,
delayed
the
onset
of
bupivacaine

-induced

cardiotoxic
effects
as
well
as
reduced
plasma
bupivacaine
levels
.

Further
studies
are
needed
to
explore
tissue
bupivacaine
levels
of
propofol
in
medialipid
and
adapt
these
results
to
clinical
practice
.

Drug
-
Induced
Acute
Liver
Injury
Within
12
Hours
After
Fluvastatin
Therapy
.

Although
statins
are
generally
well
-
tolerated
drugs
,
recent
cases
of
drug
-
induced
liver
injury
associated
with
their
use
have
been
reported
.

A
52-year
-
old
Chinese
man
reported
with
liver
damage
,
which
appeared
12
hours
after
beginning
treatment
with
fluvastatin
.

Patient
presented
with
complaints
of
increasing
nausea
,
anorexia
,
and
upper
abdominal
pain
.

His
laboratory
values
showed
elevated
creatine
kinase
and
transaminases
.

Testing
for
autoantibodies
was
also
negative
.

The
liver
biochemistries
eventually
normalized
within
3
weeks
of
stopping
the
fluvastatin
.

Therefore
,
when
prescribing
statins
,
the
possibility
of
hepatic
damage
should
be
taken
into
account
.

Fluconazole
associated

agranulocytosis
and
thrombocytopenia
.

CASE
:

We
describe
a
second
case
of
fluconazole
associated
agranulocytosis
with
thrombocytopenia
and
recovery
upon
discontinuation
of
therapy
.

The
patient
began
to
have
changes
in
white
blood
cells
and
platelets
within
48
h
of
administration
of
fluconazole
and
began
to
recover
with
48
h
of
discontinuation
.

This
case
highlights
that
drug
-
induced
blood
dyscrasias
can
occur
unexpectedly
as
a
result
of
treatment
with
a
commonly
used
drug
thought
to
be
"
safe
"
.

CONCLUSION
:

According
to
Naranjo
's
algorithm
the
likelihood
that
our
patient
's
agranulocytosis
and
thrombocytopenia
occurred
as
a
result
of
therapy
with
fluconazole
is
probable
,
with
a
total
of
six
points
.

We
feel
that
the
weight
of
the
overall
evidence
of
this
evidence
is
strong
.

In
particular
the
temporal
relationship
of
bone
marrow
suppression
to
the
initiation
of
fluconazole
and
the
abatement
of
symptoms
that
rapidly
reversed
immediately
following
discontinuation
.

AIMS
:

To

.

METHODS
:

Seventy
-
five
patients
with
non

Hodgkin
lymphoma
treated
with
epirubicin
were
studied
.

Blood
collection
and
echocardiography
were
performed
at
baseline
,
1
day
after
the
third
cycle
,
and
1
day
after
completion
of
chemotherapy
.

Patients
were
studied
using

up
.

Global
longitudinal
(
GLS
)
,
circumferential

were
calculated
using
speckle

.

Cardiotoxicity
was
defined
as
a

with
symptoms
of

RESULTS
:

Fourteen

Prevention
of
etomidate
-induced
myoclonus
:
which
is
superior
:
Fentanyl
,
midazolam
,
or
a
combination
?

A
Retrospective
comparative
study
.

BACKGROUND
:

In
this
retrospective
comparative
study
,
we
aimed
to
compare
the
effectiveness
of
fentanyl
,
midazolam
,
and
a
combination
of
fentanyl
and
midazolam
to
prevent
etomidate
-induced
myoclonus
.

MATERIAL
AND
METHODS
:

This
study
was
performed
based
on
anesthesia
records
.

Depending
on
the
drugs
that
would
be
given
before
the
induction
of
anesthesia
with
etomidate
,
the
patients
were
separated
into
4
groups
:
no
pretreatment
(
Group
NP
)
,
fentanyl

1
ug.kg-1
(
Group
F
)
,
midazolam
0.03
mg.kg-1
(
Group
M
)
,
and
midazolam
0.015
mg.kg-1
+

fentanyl
0.5
ug.kg-1

(
Group
FM
)
.

Patients
who
received
the
same
anesthetic
procedure
were
selected
:
2
minutes
after
intravenous
injections
of
the
pretreatment
drugs
,
anesthesia
is
induced
with
0.3
mg.kg-1
etomidate
injected
intravenously
over
a
period
of
20
-
30
seconds
.

Myoclonic
movements
are
evaluated
,
which
were
observed
and
graded
according
to
clinical
severity
during
the
2
minutes
after
etomidate
injection
.

The
severity
of
pain
due
to
etomidate
injection
,
mean
arterial
pressure
,
heart
rate
,
and
adverse
effects
were
also
evaluated
.

RESULTS
:

Study
results
showed
that
myoclonus
incidence
was
85
%
,
40
%
,
70
%
,
and
25
%
in
Group
NP
,
Group
F
,
Group
M
,
and
Group
FM
,
respectively
,
and
were
significantly
lower
in
Group
F
and
Group
FM
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

We
conclude
that
pretreatment
with
fentanyl
or
combination
of
fentanyl
and
midazolam
was
effective
in
preventing
etomidate
-induced
myoclonus
.

Cholestatic
presentation
of
yellow
phosphorus
poisoning
.

Yellow
phosphorus
,
a
component
of
certain
pesticide
pastes
and
fireworks
,
is
well
known
to
cause
hepatotoxicity
.

Poisoning
with
yellow
phosphorus
classically
manifests
with
acute
hepatitis
leading
to
acute
liver
failure
which
may
need
liver
transplantation
.

We
present
a
case
of
yellow
phosphorus
poisoning
in
which
a
patient
presented
with
florid
clinical
features
of
cholestasis
highlighting
the
fact
that
cholestasis
can
rarely
be
a
presenting
feature
of
yellow
phosphorus
hepatotoxicity
.

Vasovagal
syncope
and
severe
bradycardia
following
intranasal
dexmedetomidine
for
pediatric
procedural
sedation
.

We
report
syncope
and
bradycardia
in
an
11-year
-
old
girl
following
administration
of
intranasal
dexmedetomidine
for
sedation
for
a
voiding
cystourethrogram
.

Following
successful
completion
of
VCUG
and
a
60-min
recovery
period
,
the
patient
's
level
of
consciousness
and
vital
signs
returned
to
presedation
levels
.

Upon
leaving
the
sedation
area
,
the
patient
collapsed
,
with
no
apparent
inciting
event
.

The
patient
quickly
regained
consciousness
and
no
injury
occurred
.

The
primary
abnormality
found
was
persistent
bradycardia
,
and
she
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
telemetric
observation
.

The
bradycardia
lasted
~2
h
,
and
further
cardiac
workup
revealed
no
underlying
abnormality
.

Unanticipated
and
previously
unreported
outcomes
may
be
witnessed
as
we
expand
the
use
of
certain
sedatives
to
alternative
routes
of
administration
.

Paradoxical
severe
agitation
induced
by
add
-
on
high
-
doses
quetiapine
in
schizo
-
affective
disorder
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
35-year
-
old
patient
suffering
from
schizo
-
affective
disorder
since
the
age
of
19
years
,
treated
by
a
combination
of
first
-
generation
antipsychotics
,

zuclopenthixol
(
100
mg
/
day
)
and
lithium
(
1200
mg
/
day
)
(
serum

lithium

=
0.85
mEq
/
l
)
.

This
patient
had
no
associated
personality
disorder

(
particularly
no
antisocial
disorder
)
and
no
substance
abuse
disorder
.

Within
the
48
h
following
the
gradual
introduction
of
quetiapine
(
up
to
600
mg
/
day
)
,
the
patient
presented
severe
agitation
without
an
environmental
explanation
,
contrasting
with
the
absence
of
a
history
of
aggressiveness
or
personality
disorder
.

The
diagnoses
of
manic
shift
and
akathisia
were
dismissed
.

The
withdrawal
and
the
gradual
reintroduction
of
quetiapine

2
weeks
later
,
which
led
to
another
severe
agitation
,
enabled
us
to
attribute
the
agitation
specifically
to
quetiapine
.

Antioxidant
effects
of
bovine
lactoferrin
on
dexamethasone
-induced
hypertension
in
rat
.

Dexamethasone
-
(
Dex
-
)
induced

hypertension
is
associated
with
enhanced
oxidative
stress
.

Lactoferrin
(
LF
)
is
an
iron
-binding
glycoprotein
with
antihypertensive
properties
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
chronic
administration
of
LF
on
oxidative
stress
and
hypertension
upon
Dex
administration
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
treated
by
Dex

(
30
u
g
/
kg
/
day
subcutaneously
)
or
saline
for
14
days
.

Oral
bovine
LF
(
30
,
100
,
300
mg
/
kg
)
was
given
from
day
8
to
14
in
a
reversal
study
.

In
a
prevention
study
,
rats
received
4
days
of
LF
treatment
followed
by
Dex
and
continued
during
the
test
period
.

Systolic
blood
pressure
(
SBP
)
was
measured
using
tail
-
cuff
method
.

Thymus
weight
was
used
as
a
marker
of
glucocorticoid
activity
.

Plasma
hydrogen
peroxide

(
H2O2
)
concentration
and
ferric
reducing
antioxidant
power
(
FRAP
)
value
were
determined
.

Dexamethasone
significantly
increased
SBP
and
plasma
H2O2
level
and
decreased
thymus
and
body
weights
.

LF
lowered
(
P
0.01
)
and
dose
dependently
prevented
(
P
0.001
)

Dex
-induced
hypertension
.

LF
prevented
body
weight
loss
and
significantly
reduced
the
elevated
plasma
H2O2
and
increased
FRAP
values
.

Chronic
administration
of
LF
strongly
reduced
the
blood
pressure
and
production
of
ROS
and
improved
antioxidant
capacity
in
Dex

-induced

hypertension
,
suggesting
the
role
of
inhibition
of
oxidative
stress
as
another
mechanism
of
antihypertensive
action
of
LF
.

The
association
between
tranexamic
acid
and
convulsive
seizures
after
cardiac
surgery
:
a
multivariate
analysis
in
11
529
patients
.

Because
of
a
lack
of
contemporary
data
regarding
seizures
after
cardiac
surgery
,
we
undertook
a
retrospective
analysis
of
prospectively
collected
data
from
11
529
patients
in
whom
cardiopulmonary
bypass
was
used
from
January
2004
to
December
2010
.

A
convulsive
seizure
was
defined
as
a
transient
episode
of
disturbed
brain
function
characterised
by
abnormal
involuntary
motor
movements
.

Multivariate
regression
analysis
was
performed
to
identify
independent
predictors
of
postoperative
seizures
.

A
total
of
100
(
0.9
%
)

patients
developed
postoperative
convulsive
seizures
.

Generalised
and
focal
seizures
were
identified
in
68
and
32
patients
,
respectively
.

The
median
(
IQR
[
range
]
)
time
after
surgery
when
the
seizure
occurred
was
7
(
6
-
12
[
1
-
216
]
)

h
and
8
(
6
-
11
[
4
-
18
]
)

h
,
respectively
.

Epileptiform
findings
on

,
congestive
heart

,
deep

,

and
tranexamic
acid
.

When
tested
in
a
multivariate
regression
analysis
,
tranexamic

was
a
strong
independent
predictor
of
seizures
(

.

Patients

had
2.5
times
higher

hospital
mortality
rates
and
twice
the
length
of

stay
compared
with
patients
without

.

Mean
(

.

Convulsive

seizures
are
a
serious
postoperative
complication
after
cardiac
surgery
.

As
tranexamic
acid
is
the
only
modifiable
factor
,
its
administration
,
particularly
in

should
be

Dysfunctional
overnight
memory
consolidation
in
ecstasy
users
.

Sleep
plays
an
important
role
in
the
consolidation
and
integration
of
memory
in
a
process
called
overnight
memory
consolidation
.

Previous
studies
indicate
that
ecstasy
users
have
marked
and
persistent
neurocognitive
and
sleep
-
related
impairments
.

We
extend
past
research
by
examining
overnight
memory
consolidation
among
regular
ecstasy
users
(
n=12
)
and
drug
naive
healthy
controls
(
n=26
)
.

Memory
recall
of
word
pairs
was
evaluated
before
and
after
a
period
of
sleep
,
with
and
without
interference
prior
to
testing
.

In
addition
,
we
assessed
neurocognitive
performances
across
tasks
of
learning
,
memory
and
executive
functioning
.

Ecstasy
users
demonstrated
impaired
overnight
memory
consolidation
,
a
finding
that
was
more
pronounced
following
associative
interference
.

Additionally
,
ecstasy
users
demonstrated
impairments
on
tasks
recruiting
frontostriatal
and
hippocampal
neural
circuitry
,
in
the
domains
of
proactive
interference
memory
,
long
-
term
memory
,
encoding
,
working
memory
and
complex
planning
.

We
suggest
that
ecstasy
-associated
dysfunction
in
fronto
-
temporal
circuitry
may
underlie
overnight
consolidation
memory
impairments
in
regular
ecstasy
users
.

Normoammonemic
encephalopathy
:
solely
valproate
induced
or
multiple
mechanisms
?

A
77-year
-
old
woman
presented
with
subacute
onset
progressive
confusion
,
aggression
,
auditory
hallucinations
and
delusions
.

In
the
preceding
months
,
the
patient
had
a
number
of
admissions
with
transient
unilateral
hemiparesis
with
facial
droop
,
and
had
been
started
on
valproate
for
presumed
hemiplegic
migraine
.

Valproate
was
withdrawn
soon
after
admission
and
her
cognitive
abilities
have
gradually
improved
over
3
months
of
follow
-
up
.

Valproate
levels
taken
prior
to
withdrawal
were
subtherapeutic
and
the
patient
was
normoammonaemic
.

EEG
undertaken
during
inpatient
stay
showed
changes
consistent
with
encephalopathy
,
and
low
titre
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptor
antibodies
were
present
in
this
patient
.

The
possible
aetiologies
of
valproate
-induced
encephalopathy
and
NMDA
receptor
-
associated
encephalitis
present
a
diagnostic
dilemma
.

We
present
a
putative
combinatorial
hypothesis
to
explain
this
patient
's
symptoms
.

Cerebellar
and
oculomotor
dysfunction
induced
by
rapid
infusion
of
pethidine
.

Pethidine
is
an
opioid
that
gains
its
popularity
for
the
effective
pain
control
through
acting
on
the
opioid
-
receptors
.

However
,
rapid
pain
relief
sometimes
brings
about
unfavourable
side
effects
that
largely
limit
its
clinical
utility
.

Common
side
effects
include
nausea
,
vomiting
and
hypotension
.

In
patients
with
impaired
renal
and
liver
function
,
and
those
who
need
long
-
term
pain
control
,
pethidine
may
cause
excitatory
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
effects
through
its
neurotoxic
metabolite
,
norpethidine
,
resulting
in
irritability
and
seizure
attack
.

On
the
contrary
,
though
not
clinically
apparent
,
pethidine
potentially
causes
inhibitory
impacts
on
the
CNS
and
impairs
normal
cerebellar
and
oculomotor
function
in
the
short
term
.

In
this
case
report
,
we
highlight
opioid
's
inhibitory
side
effects
on
the
cerebellar
structure
that
causes

dysmetria
,
dysarthria
,
reduced
smooth
pursuit
gain
and
decreased
saccadic
velocity
.

Baboon
syndrome
induced
by
ketoconazole
.

A
27-year
-
old
male
patient
presented
with
a
maculopapular
eruption
on
the
flexural
areas
and
buttocks
after
using
oral
ketoconazole
.

The
patient
was
diagnosed
with
drug
-
induced
baboon
syndrome
based
on
his
history
,
which
included
prior
sensitivity
to
topical
ketoconazole
,
a
physical
examination
,
and
histopathological
findings
.

Baboon
syndrome
is
a
drug-
or
contact
allergen
-
related
maculopapular
eruption
that
typically
involves
the
flexural
and
gluteal
areas
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
reported
case
of
ketoconazole
-induced

baboon
syndrome
in
the
English
literature
.

A
Case
of
Sudden
Cardiac
Death
due
to
Pilsicainide
-Induced
Torsades
de
Pointes
.

An
84-year
-
old
male
received
oral
pilsicainide
,
a
pure
sodium
channel
blocker
with
slow
recovery
kinetics
,
to
convert
his
paroxysmal
atrial
fibrillation
to
a
sinus
rhythm
;
the
patient
developed
sudden
cardiac
death

two
days
later
.

The
Holter
electrocardiogram
,
which
was
worn
by
chance
,
revealed

torsade
de
pointes
with
gradually
prolonged
QT
intervals
.

This
drug
is
rapidly
absorbed
from
the
gastrointestinal
tract
,
and
most
of
it
is
excreted
from
the
kidney
.

Although
the
patient
's
renal
function
was
not
highly
impaired
and
the
dose
of
pilsicainide
was
low
,
the
plasma
concentration
of
pilsicainide
may
have
been
high
,
which
can
produce
torsades
de
pointes
in
the
octogenarian
.

Although
the
oral
administration
of
class
IC
drugs
,
including
pilsicainide
,
is
effective
to
terminate
atrial
fibrillation
,
careful
consideration
must
be
taken
before
giving
these
drugs
to
octogenarians
.

All

retinoic
acid
(
ATRA
)
,
a
component
of
standard
therapy
for
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia

(
APL

,
is
associated
with
potentially
serious
but
treatable
adverse
effects
involving
numerous
organ
systems
,
including
rare
skeletal

.

Only
a
handful
of
cases
of
ATRA

in
children
have
been
reported
,
and
none
in

We
present
such
a
case
in
a
15-year

with
APL
,
where
recognition
of

findings
played
a
crucial

Nelarabine

neurotoxicity
with
concurrent
intrathecal
chemotherapy
:

Case
report
and
review
of
literature
.

Severe
nelarabine
neurotoxicity
in
a
patient
who
received
concurrent
intrathecal
(
IT
)
chemotherapy
is
reported
.

A
37-year
-
old
Caucasian
woman
with
a
history
of
T
-
cell
lymphoblastic
lymphoma
was
admitted
for
relapsed
disease
.

She
was
originally
treated
with
induction
chemotherapy
followed
by
an
autologous
transplant
.

She
developed
relapsed
disease
10
months
later
with
leukemic
involvement
.

She
was
re
-
induced
with
nelarabine
1500
mg
/
m(2
)
on
days
1
,
3
,
and
5
with
1
dose
of
IT
cytarabine
100
mg
on
day
2
as
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
prophylaxis
.

At
the
time
of
treatment
,
she
was
on
continuous
renal
replacement
therapy
due
to
sequelae
of
tumor
lysis
syndrome

(
TLS
)
.

She
tolerated
therapy
well
,
entered
a
complete
remission
,
and
recovered
her
renal
function
.

She
received
a
second
cycle
of
nelarabine
without
additional
IT
prophylaxis
one
month
later
.

A
week
after
this
second
cycle
,
she
noted
numbness
in
her
lower
extremities
.

Predominantly
sensory
,
though
also
motor
and
autonomic
,
peripheral
neuropathy
started
in
her
feet
,
ascended
proximally
to
the
mid
-
thoracic
region
,
and
eventually
included
her
distal
upper
extremities
.

A
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
MRI
)
of
her
spine
demonstrated
changes
from
C2
to
C6
consistent
with
subacute
combined
degeneration
.

Nelarabine
was
felt
to
be
the
cause
of
her
symptoms
.

Her
neuropathy
stabilized
and
showed
slight
improvement
and
ultimately
received
an
unrelated
,
reduced
-
intensity
allogeneic
transplant
while
in
complete
remission
,
but
relapsed
disease
10
weeks
later
.

She
is
currently
being
treated
with
best
supportive
care
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
published
case
report
of
severe
neurotoxicity
caused
by
nelarabine
in
a
patient
who
received
concurrent
IT
chemotherapy
.

Valproate
-induced
hyperammonemic

encephalopathy
in
a
renal
transplanted
patient
.

Neurological
complications
after
renal
transplantation
constitute
an
important
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Their
differential
diagnosis
is
difficult
and
essential
for
subsequent
patient
's
management
.

Valproate
-induced
hyperammonemic

encephalopathy
is
an
uncommon
but
serious
effect
of
valproate
treatment
.

Here
,
we
describe
the
case
of
a
15-year
-
old
girl
who
was
on
a
long
-
term
therapy
with
valproate
due
to
epilepsy
and
revealed
impaired
consciousness
with

hyperammonemia
12
days
after
renal
transplantation
.

After
withdraw
of
valproate
,
patients
'
symptoms
resolved
within
24
h.
Clinicians
should
increase
their
awareness
for
potential
complication
of
valproate
,
especially
in
transplanted
patients
.

Necrotising
fasciitis
after
bortezomib
and
dexamethasone

-containing
regimen
in
an
elderly
patient
of
Waldenstrom
macroglobulinaemia
.

Bortezomib
and
high
-
dose

dexamethasone

-containing

regimens
are
considered
to
be
generally
tolerable
with
few
severe
bacterial
infections
in
patients
with
B
-
cell
malignancies
.

However
,
information
is
limited
concerning
the
safety
of
the
regimen
in
elderly
patients
.

We
report
a
case
of
a
76-year
-
old
man
with
Waldenstrom
macroglobulinaemia
who
suffered
necrotising
fasciitis
without
neutropenia
after
the
combination
treatment
with
bortezomib
,
high
-
dose
dexamethasone
and
rituximab
.

Despite
immediate
intravenous
antimicrobial
therapy
,
he
succumbed
23
h
after
the
onset
.

Physicians
should
recognise
the
possibility
of
fatal
bacterial
infections
related
to
bortezomib
plus
high
-
dose

dexamethasone
in
elderly
patients
,
and
we
believe
this
case
warrants
further
investigation
.

An
integrated
characterization
of
serological
,
pathological
,
and
functional
events
in
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

Many
efficacious
cancer
treatments
cause
significant
cardiac
morbidity
,
yet
biomarkers
or
functional
indices
of
early
damage
,
which
would
allow
monitoring
and
intervention
,
are
lacking
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
utilized
a
rat
model
of
progressive
doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
-induced
cardiomyopathy
,
applying
multiple
approaches
,
including
cardiac
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
MRI
)
,
to
provide
the
most
comprehensive
characterization
to
date
of
the
timecourse
of
serological
,
pathological
,
and
functional
events
underlying
this
toxicity
.

Hannover
Wistar
rats
were
dosed
with
1.25
mg
/
kg

DOX
weekly
for
8
weeks
followed
by
a
4
week
off
-
dosing
"
recovery
"
period
.

Electron
microscopy
of
the
myocardium
revealed

subcellular
degeneration
and
marked
mitochondrial
changes
after
a
single
dose
.

Histopathological
analysis
revealed
progressive
cardiomyocyte
degeneration
,
hypertrophy
/cytomegaly
,
and
extensive
vacuolation
after
two
doses
.

Extensive
replacement
fibrosis
(
quantified
by
Sirius
red
staining
)
developed
during
the
off
-
dosing
period
.

Functional
indices
assessed
by
cardiac
MRI
(
including
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(
LVEF
)
,
cardiac
output
,
and
E
/
A
ratio
)
declined
progressively
,
reaching
statistical
significance
after
two
doses
and
culminating
in
"
clinical
"
LV
dysfunction
by
12
weeks
.

Significant
increases
in
peak
myocardial
contrast
enhancement
and
serological
cardiac
troponin
I
(
cTnI
)
emerged
after
eight
doses
,
importantly
preceding
the
LVEF
decline
to
50
%
.

Troponin
I
levels
positively
correlated
with
delayed
and
peak
gadolinium
contrast
enhancement
,
histopathological
grading
,
and
diastolic
dysfunction
.

In
summary
,
subcellular
cardiomyocyte
degeneration
was
the
earliest
marker
,
followed
by
progressive
functional
decline
and
histopathological
manifestations
.

Myocardial
contrast
enhancement
and
elevations
in
cTnI
occurred
later
.

However
,
all
indices
predated
"
clinical
"
LV
dysfunction
and
thus
warrant
further
evaluation
as
predictive
biomarkers
.

Intradermal
glutamate
and
capsaicin
injections
:
intra-
and
interindividual
variability
of
provoked
hyperalgesia
and
allodynia
.

Intradermal
injections
of
glutamate
and
capsaicin
are
attractive
to
use
in
human
experimental
pain
models
because
hyperalgesia
and
allodynia
mimic
isolated
aspects
of
clinical
pain
disorders
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
reproducibility
of
these
models
.

Twenty
healthy
male
volunteers
(
mean
age
24
years
;
range
18
-
38
years
)
received
intradermal
injections
of
glutamate
and
capsaicin
in
the
volar
forearm
.

Magnitudes
of
secondary
pinprick
hyperalgesia
and
brush
-
evoked
allodynia
were
investigated
using
von
Frey
filaments
(
gauges
10
,
15
,
60
and
100
g
)
and
brush
strokes
.

Areas
of
secondary
hyperalgesia
and
allodynia
were
quantified
immediately
after
injection
and
after
15
,
30
and
60
min
.

Two
identical
experiments
separated
by
at
least
7
days
were
performed
.

Reproducibility
across
and
within
volunteers
(
inter-
and
intra
-
individual
variation
,
respectively
)
was
assessed
using
intraclass
correlation
coefficient
(
ICC
)
and
coefficient
of
variation
(
CV
)
.

Secondary
pinprick

hyperalgesia
was
observed
as
a
marked
increase
in
the
visual
analogue
scale
(
VAS
)
response
to
von
Frey
gauges
60
and
100
g
(
P
0.001
)
after
glutamate
injection
.

For
capsaicin
,
secondary
pinprick
hyperalgesia
was
detected
with
all
von
Frey
gauges
(
P
0.001
)
.

Glutamate

.

Capsaicin
injection
was
reproducible
for
secondary
hyperalgesia

(
ICC

0.70
)
and

In
conclusion
,
glutamate

allodynic
responses
,
and

Ocular
-
specific
ER
stress
reduction
rescues

glaucoma
in
murine
glucocorticoid
-
induced
glaucoma
.

Administration
of
glucocorticoids
induces
ocular
hypertension
in
some
patients
.

If
untreated
,
these
patients
can
develop
a
secondary
glaucoma
that
resembles
primary
open
-
angle
glaucoma

(
POAG
)
.

The
underlying
pathology
of
glucocorticoid
-
induced
glaucoma
is
not
fully
understood
,
due
in
part
to
lack
of
an
appropriate
animal
model
.

Here
,
we
developed
a
murine
model
of
glucocorticoid
-
induced
glaucoma
that
exhibits
glaucoma
features
that
are
observed
in
patients
.

Treatment
of
WT
mice
with
topical
ocular
0.1
%
dexamethasone
led
to
elevation
of
intraocular
pressure
(
IOP
)
,
functional
and
structural
loss
of
retinal
ganglion
cells
,
and
axonal
degeneration
,
resembling
glucocorticoid
-
induced
glaucoma
in
human
patients
.

Furthermore
,
dexamethasone
-induced

ocular
hypertension
was
associated
with
chronic
ER
stress
of
the
trabecular
meshwork
(
TM
)
.

Similar
to
patients
,
withdrawal
of
dexamethasone
treatment
reduced
elevated
IOP
and
ER
stress
in
this
animal
model
.

Dexamethasone
induced
the
transcriptional
factor
CHOP
,
a
marker
for
chronic
ER
stress
,
in
the
anterior
segment
tissues
,
and
Chop
deletion
reduced
ER
stress
in
these
tissues
and
prevented

dexamethasone
-induced

ocular
hypertension
.

Furthermore
,
reduction
of
ER
stress
in
the
TM
with
sodium
4-phenylbutyrate
prevented
dexamethasone
-induced
ocular
hypertension
in
WT
mice
.

Our
data
indicate
that
ER
stress
contributes
to
glucocorticoid
-
induced
ocular
hypertension
and
suggest
that
reducing
ER
stress
has
potential
as
a
therapeutic
strategy
for
treating
glucocorticoid
-
induced
glaucoma
.

Effects
of
ginsenosides
on
opioid
-
induced
hyperalgesia
in
mice
.

Opioid
-
induced
hyperalgesia

(
OIH
)
is
characterized
by
nociceptive
sensitization
caused
by
the
cessation
of
chronic
opioid
use
.

OIH
can
limit
the
clinical
use
of
opioid
analgesics
and
complicate
withdrawal
from
opioid
addiction
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
Re
,
Rg1
,
and
Rb1
ginsenosides
,
the
bioactive
components
of
ginseng
,
on
OIH
.

OIH
was
achieved
in
mice
after
subcutaneous
administration
of
morphine
for
7
consecutive
days
three
times
per
day
.

During
withdrawal
(
days
8
and
9
)
,
these
mice
were
administered

Re
,
Rg1
,
or
Rb1
intragastrically
two
times
per
day
.

On
the
test
day
(
day
10
)
,
mice
were
subjected
to
the
thermal
sensitivity
test
and
the
acetic
acid
-induced
writhing
test
.

Re
(
300
mg
/
kg
)
inhibited

OIH
in
both
the
thermal
sensitivity
test
and
the
acetic
acid
-induced
writhing
test
.

However
,
the
Rg1
and
Rb1
ginsenosides
failed
to
prevent
OIH
in
either
test
.

Furthermore
,
Rg1
showed
a
tendency
to
aggravate
OIH
in
the
acetic
acid
-induced
writhing
test
.

Our
data
suggested
that
the
ginsenoside
Re
,
but
not
Rg1
or
Rb1
,
may
contribute
toward
reversal
of
OIH
.

A
comparison
of
severe
hemodynamic
disturbances
between
dexmedetomidine
and
propofol
for
sedation
in
neurocritical
care
patients
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Dexmedetomidine
and
propofol
are
commonly
used
sedatives
in
neurocritical
care
as
they
allow
for
frequent
neurologic
examinations
.

However
,
both
agents
are
associated
with
significant
hemodynamic
side
effects
.

The
primary
objective
of
this
study
is
to
compare
the
prevalence
of
severe
hemodynamic
effects
in
neurocritical
care
patients
receiving
dexmedetomidine
and
propofol
.

DESIGN
:

Multicenter
,
retrospective
,
propensity
-
matched
cohort
study
.

SETTING
:

Neurocritical
care
units
at
two
academic
medical
centers
with
dedicated
neurocritical
care
teams
and
board
-
certified
neurointensivists
.

PATIENTS
:

Neurocritical
care
patients
admitted
between
July
2009
and
September
2012
were
evaluated
and
then
matched
1:1
based
on
propensity
scoring
of
baseline
characteristics
.

INTERVENTIONS
:

Continuous
sedation
with
dexmedetomidine
or
propofol
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:

A
total
of
342
patients
(
105
dexmedetomidine
and
237
propofol
)
were
included
in
the
analysis
,
with
190
matched
(
95
in
each
group
)
by
propensity
score
.

The
primary
outcome
of
this
study
was
a
composite
of
severe
hypotension

(
mean
arterial
pressure
60
mm
Hg
)
and
bradycardia

(
heart
rate
50
beats
/
min
)
during
sedative
infusion
.

No
difference
in
the
primary
composite
outcome
in
both
the
unmatched
(
30
%
vs
30
%
,
p
=
0.94
)
or
matched
cohorts
(
28
%
vs
34
%
,
p
=
0.35
)
could
be
found
.

When
analyzed
separately
,
no
differences
could
be
found
in
the
prevalence
of
severe
hypotension
or
bradycardia
in
either
the
unmatched
or
matched
cohorts
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Severe
hypotension
and
bradycardia
occur
at
similar
prevalence
in
neurocritical
care
patients
who
receive
dexmedetomidine
or
propofol
.

Providers
should
similarly
consider
the
likelihood
of
hypotension
or
bradycardia
before
starting
either
sedative
.

Hydroxytyrosol
ameliorates
oxidative
stress
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction
in
doxorubicin
-induced

cardiotoxicity
in
rats
with
breast
cancer
.

Oxidative
stress
is
involved
in
several
processes
including
cancer
,
aging
and
cardiovascular
disease
,
and
has
been
shown
to
potentiate
the
therapeutic
effect
of
drugs
such
as
doxorubicin
.

Doxorubicin
causes
significant
cardiotoxicity
characterized
by
marked
increases
in
oxidative
stress
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction
.

Herein
,
we
investigate
whether
doxorubicin
-associated
chronic

cardiac
toxicity
can
be
ameliorated
with
the
antioxidant
hydroxytyrosol
in
rats
with
breast
cancer
.

Thirty
-
six
rats
bearing

breast
tumors
induced
chemically
were
divided
into
4
groups
:
control
,
hydroxytyrosol
(
0.5mg

/
kg
,
5days
/
week
)
,
doxorubicin

(
1mg
/
kg
/
week
)
,
and
doxorubicin
plus
hydroxytyrosol
.

Cardiac
disturbances
at
the
cellular
and
mitochondrial
level
,
mitochondrial
electron
transport
chain
complexes
I
-
IV
and
apoptosis
-
inducing
factor
,
and
oxidative
stress
markers
have
been
analyzed
.

Hydroxytyrosol
improved
the
cardiac
disturbances
enhanced
by
doxorubicin
by
significantly
reducing
the
percentage
of
altered
mitochondria
and
oxidative
damage
.

These
results
suggest
that
hydroxytyrosol
improve
the
mitochondrial
electron
transport
chain
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
hydroxytyrosol
protect
rat
heart
damage
provoked
by
doxorubicin
decreasing
oxidative
damage
and
mitochondrial
alterations
.

PURPOSE
:

The
case
of
an
oncology
patient
who
developed
heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
with
thrombosis

(
HITT
)
and
was
treated
with
argatroban
plus
catheter
-
directed
thrombolysis
(
CDT
)
with
alteplase
is
presented
.

SUMMARY
:

A
63-year
-
old
Caucasian
man
with
renal
amyloidosis
undergoing
peripheral
blood
stem
cell
collection
for
an
autologous
stem
cell
transplant
developed
extensive
bilateral
upper
-
extremity
deep
venous
thrombosis

(
DVT
)
and
pulmonary
embolism
secondary
to
heparin

-induced
thrombocytopenia
.

A
continuous
i.v
.
infusion
of
argatroban
was
initiated
,
and
the
patient
was
managed
on
the
general
medical
floor
.

After
one
week
of
therapy
,
he
was
transferred
to
the
intensive
care
unit
with
cardiopulmonary
compromise
related
to
superior
vena
cava
(
SVC
)
syndrome
.

A
percutaneous
mechanical
thrombectomy
and
CDT
with
alteplase
were
attempted
,
but
the
procedure
was
aborted
due
to
epistaxis
.

The
epistaxis
resolved
the
next
day
,
and
the
patient
was
restarted
on
argatroban
.

A
second
percutaneous
mechanical
thrombectomy
was
performed
six
days
later
and
resulted
in
partial
revascularization
of
the
SVC
and
central
veins
.

Postthrombectomy
continuous
CDT
with
alteplase
was
commenced
while
argatroban
was
withheld
,
and
complete
patency
of
the
SVC
and
central
veins
was
achieved
after
three
days
of
therapy
.

Alteplase
was
discontinued
,
and
the
patient
was
reinitiated
on
argatroban
;
ultimately
,
he
was
transitioned
to
warfarin
for
long
-
term
anticoagulation
.

Although
the
patient
recovered
,
he
experienced
permanent
vision
and
hearing
loss
,
as
well
as
end
-
stage
renal
disease
.

CONCLUSION
:

A
63-year
-
old
man
with
renal
amyloidosis
and
SVC
syndrome
secondary
to
HITT
was
successfully
treated
with
argatroban

Effects
of
dehydroepiandrosterone
in
amphetamine
-induced

schizophrenia
models
in
mice
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
examine
the
effects
of
dehydroepiandrosterone

(
DHEA
)
on
animal
models
of
schizophrenia
.

METHODS
:

Seventy
Swiss
albino
female
mice
(
25
-
35
g
)
were
divided
into
4
groups
:
amphetamine
-free
(
control
)
,
amphetamine
,
50
,
and
100
mg
/
kg
DHEA
.

The
DHEA
was
administered
intraperitoneally
(
ip
)
for
5
days
.

Amphetamine

(
3
mg
/
kg
ip
)
induced
hyper
locomotion
,
apomorphine

(
1.5
mg
/
kg
subcutaneously
[
sc
]
)
induced
climbing
,
and
haloperidol
(
1.5
mg
/
kg
sc
)
induced
catalepsy
tests
were
used
as
animal
models
of
schizophrenia
.

The
study
was
conducted
at
the
Animal
Experiment
Laboratories
,
Department
of
Pharmacology
,
Medical
School
,
Eskisehir
Osmangazi
University
,
Eskisehir
,
Turkey
between
March
and
May
2012
.

Statistical
analysis
was
carried
out
using
Kruskal
-
Wallis
test
for
hyper
locomotion
,
and
one
-
way
ANOVA
for
climbing
and
catalepsy
tests
.

RESULTS
:

In
the
amphetamine
-induced
locomotion
test
,
there
were
significant
increases
in
all
movements
compared
with
the
amphetamine
-free
group
.

Both
DHEA

50
mg
/
kg
(
p<0.05
)
,
and
100
mg
/
kg
(
p<0.01
)

significantly
decreased
all
movements
compared
with
the
amphetamine
-induced
locomotion
group
.

There
was
a
significant
difference
between
groups
in
the
haloperidol
-induced
catalepsy
test
(
p<0.05
)
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
between
groups
in
terms
of
total
climbing
time
in
the
apomorphine
-induced
climbing
test
(
p>0.05
)
.

CONCLUSION

:
We
observed
that
DHEA
reduced
locomotor
activity
and
increased
catalepsy
at
both
doses
,
while
it
had
no
effect
on
climbing
behavior
.

We
suggest
that
DHEA
displays
typical
neuroleptic
-
like
effects
,
and
may
be
used
in
the
treatment
of
schizophrenia
.

Availability
of
human
induced
pluripotent
stem
cell
-
derived
cardiomyocytes
in
assessment
of
drug
potential
for
QT
prolongation
.

Field
potential
duration
(
FPD
)
in
human
-
induced
pluripotent
stem
cell
-
derived
cardiomyocytes
(
hiPS
-
CMs
)
,
which
can
express
QT
interval
in
an
electrocardiogram
,
is
reported
to
be
a
useful
tool
to
predict
K
(
+
)
channel
and
Ca
(
2
+
)
channel
blocker
effects
on
QT
interval
.

However
,
there
is
no
report
showing
that
this
technique
can
be
used
to
predict
multichannel
blocker
potential
for
QT
prolongation
.

The
aim
of
this
study
is
to
show
that
FPD
from
MEA
(
Multielectrode
array
)
of
hiPS
-
CMs
can
detect
QT
prolongation
induced
by
multichannel
blockers
.

hiPS
-
CMs
were
seeded
onto
MEA
and
FPD
was
measured
for
2min
every
10min
for
30min
after
drug
exposure
for
the
vehicle
and
each
drug
concentration
.

IKr
and
IKs
blockers
concentration
-
dependently
prolonged
corrected
FPD
(
FPDc
)
,
whereas
Ca
(
2
+
)
channel
blockers
concentration
-
dependently
shortened
FPDc
.

Also
,
the
multichannel
blockers
Amiodarone
,
Paroxetine
,
Terfenadine
and
Citalopram
prolonged
FPDc
in
a
concentration
dependent
manner
.

Finally
,
the
IKr
blockers
,
Terfenadine
and
Citalopram
,
which
are
reported
to
cause
Torsade
de
Pointes

(
TdP
)
in
clinical
practice
,
produced
early
afterdepolarization
(
EAD
)
.

hiPS
-
CMs
using
MEA
system
and
FPDc
can
predict
the
effects
of
drug
candidates
on
QT
interval
.

This
study
also
shows
that
this
assay
can
help
detect
EAD
for
drugs
with
TdP
potential
.

Dermal
developmental

toxicity
of
N
-
phenylimide
herbicides
in
rats
.

BACKGROUND
:

S-53482
and
S-23121
are
N
-
phenylimide
herbicides
and
produced
embryolethality
,

teratogenicity
(
mainly
ventricular
septal
defects
and
wavy
ribs
)
,
and
growth
retardation
in
rats
in
conventional
oral
developmental

toxicity
studies
.

Our
objective
in
this
study
was
to
investigate
whether
the
compounds
induce
developmental
toxicity
via
the
dermal
route
,
which
is
more
relevant
to
occupational
exposure
,
hence
better
addressing
human
health
risks
.

METHODS
:

S-53482
was
administered
dermally
to
rats
at
30
,
100
,
and
300
mg
/
kg
during
organogenesis
,
and
S-23121
was
administered
at
200
,
400
,
and
800
mg
/
kg
(
the
maximum
applicable
dose
level
)
.

Fetuses
were
obtained
by
a
Cesarean
section
and
examined
for
external
,
visceral
,
and
skeletal
alterations
.

RESULTS
:

Dermal
exposure
of
rats
to

S-53482
at
300
mg
/
kg
produced
patterns
of
developmental
toxicity
similar
to
those
resulting
from
oral
exposure
.

Toxicity
included

embryolethality
,
teratogenicity
,
and
growth
retardation
.

Dermal
administration
of
S-23121
at
800
mg
/
kg
resulted
in
an
increased
incidence
of
embryonic
death
and
ventricular
septal
defect
,
but
retarded
fetal
growth
was
not
observed
as
it
was
following
oral
exposure
to
S-23121
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Based
on
the
results
,
S-53482
and
S-23121
were
teratogenic
when
administered
dermally
to
pregnant
rats
as
were
the
compounds
administered
orally
.

Thus
,
investigation
of
the
mechanism
and
its
human
relevancy
become
more
important
.

Rates
of

in
Cancer
Patients
Receiving
Cisplatin

With
and
Without
Mannitol
.

BACKGROUND
:

Cisplatin
is
a
widely
used
antineoplastic
.

One
of
the
major
complications
of
cisplatin
use
is
dose
-
limiting
nephrotoxicity
.

There
are
many
strategies
to
prevent
this
toxicity
,
including
the
use
of
mannitol
as
a
nephroprotectant
in
combination
with
hydration
.

OBJECTIVE
:

We
aimed
to
evaluate
the
rates
of
cisplatin
-induced
nephrotoxicity
in
cancer
patients
receiving
single
-
agent
cisplatin
with
and
without
mannitol
.

METHODS
:

This
single
-
center
retrospective
analysis
was
a
quasi
experiment
created
by
the
national
mannitol
shortage
.

Data
were
collected
on
adult
cancer
patients
receiving
single
-
agent
cisplatin
as
an
outpatient
from
January
2011
to
September
2012
.

The
primary
outcome
was
acute
kidney
injury

(
AKI
)
.

RESULTS
:

We
evaluated
143
patients
who
received
single
-
agent
cisplatin
;
97.2
%
of
patients
had
head
and
neck
cancer
as
their
primary
malignancy
.

Patients
who
did
not
receive
mannitol
were
more
likely
to
develop
nephrotoxicity
:
odds
ratio
[
OR
]
=
2.646
(
95
%
CI
=
1.008
,
6.944
;
P
=
0.048
)
.

Patients
who
received
the
100
mg
/
m(2
)
dosing
and
patients
who
had
a
history
of
hypertension
also
had
a
higher
likelihood
of
developing
nephrotoxicity
:

OR
=
11.494
(
95
%
CI

=
4.149
,
32.258
;
P
0.0001
)
and
OR
=
3.219
(
95
%
CI
=
1.228
,
8.439
;
P
=
0.017
)
,
respectively
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

When
limited
quantities
of
mannitol
are
available
,
it
should
preferentially
be
given
to
patients
at
particularly
high
risk
of
nephrotoxicity
.

Our
analysis
suggests
that
those
patients
receiving
the
dosing
schedule
of
100
mg
/
m(2
)

cisplatin
every
3
weeks
and
those
with
hypertension
are
at
the
greatest
risk
of
nephrotoxicity
and
would
benefit
from
the
addition
of
mannitol
.

Metformin
protects
against
seizures
,
learning
and
memory
impairments
and
oxidative
damage
induced
by
pentylenetetrazole
-induced
kindling
in
mice
.

Cognitive
impairment
,
the
most
common
and
severe
comorbidity
of
epilepsy
,
greatly
diminishes
the
quality
of
life
.

However
,
current
therapeutic
interventions
for
epilepsy
can
also
cause
untoward
cognitive
effects
.

Thus
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
for
new
kinds
of
agents
targeting
both
seizures
and
cognition
deficits
.

Oxidative
stress
is
considered
to
play
an
important
role
in
epileptogenesis
and
cognitive
deficits
,
and
antioxidants
have
a
putative
antiepileptic
potential
.

Metformin
,
the
most
commonly
prescribed
antidiabetic
oral
drug
,
has
antioxidant
properties
.

This
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
ameliorative
effects
of
metformin
on
seizures
,
cognitive
impairment
and
brain
oxidative
stress
markers
observed
in
pentylenetetrazole

-induced
kindling
animals
.

Male
C57BL/6
mice
were
administered
with
subconvulsive
dose
of
pentylenetetrazole

(
37
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)

every
other
day
for
14
injections
.

Metformin
was
injected
intraperitoneally
in
dose
of
200mg
/
kg
along
with
alternate
-
day
PTZ
.

We
found
that
metformin
suppressed
the
progression
of
kindling
,
ameliorated
the
cognitive
impairment
and
decreased
brain
oxidative
stress
.

Thus
the
present
study
concluded
that
metformin
may
be
a
potential
agent
for
the
treatment
of
epilepsy
as
well
as
a
protective
medicine
against
cognitive
impairment
induced
by
seizures
.

P53
inhibition
exacerbates
late
-
stage
anthracycline
cardiotoxicity
.

AIMS
:
Doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
is
an
effective
anti-
cancer
therapeutic
,
but
is
associated
with
both
acute
and
late
-
stage
cardiotoxicity
.

Children
are
particularly
sensitive
to
DOX
-induced
heart
failure
.

Here
,
the
impact
of
p53
inhibition
on
acute
vs.
late
-
stage
DOX
cardiotoxicity
was
examined
in
a
juvenile
model
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Two
-
week
-
old
MHC
-
CB7
mice
(
which
express
dominant
-
interfering
p53
in
cardiomyocytes
)
and
their
non
-
transgenic
(
NON
-
TXG
)

littermates
received
weekly
DOX
injections
for
5
weeks
(
25
mg
/
kg
cumulative
dose
)
.

One
week
after
the
last
DOX
treatment
(
acute
stage
)
,
MHC
-
CB7
mice
exhibited
improved
cardiac
function
and
lower
levels
of
cardiomyocyte
apoptosis
when
compared
with
the
NON
-
TXG
mice
.

Surprisingly
,
by
13
weeks
following
the
last
DOX
treatment
(
late
stage
)
,
MHC
-
CB7
exhibited
a
progressive
decrease
in
cardiac
function
and
higher
rates
of
cardiomyocyte
apoptosis
when
compared
with
NON
-
TXG
mice
.

p53
inhibition
blocked
transient

DOX
-induced

STAT3
activation
in
MHC
-
CB7
mice
,
which
was
associated
with
enhanced
induction
of
the
DNA
repair
proteins
Ku70
and
Ku80
.

Mice
with
cardiomyocyte
-
restricted
deletion
of
STAT3
exhibited
worse
cardiac
function
,
higher
levels
of
cardiomyocyte
apoptosis
,
and
a
greater
induction
of
Ku70
and
Ku80
in
response
to
DOX
treatment
during
the
acute
stage
when
compared
with
control
animals
.

CONCLUSION
:

These
data
support
a
model
wherein
a
p53-dependent
cardioprotective
pathway
,
mediated
via
STAT3
activation
,
mitigates
DOX

-induced
myocardial
stress
during
drug
delivery
.

Furthermore
,
these
data
suggest
an
explanation
as
to
how
p53
inhibition
can
result
in
cardioprotection
during
drug
treatment
and
,
paradoxically
,
enhanced
cardiotoxicity
long
after
the
cessation
of
drug
treatment
.

Metronidazole
-induced
encephalopathy
:
an
uncommon
scenario
.

Metronidazole
can
produce
neurological
complications
although
it
is
not
a
common
scenario
.

We
present
a
case
where
a
patient
developed
features
of
encephalopathy
following
prolonged
metronidazole
intake
.

Magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
MRI
)
brain
showed
abnormal
signal
intensity
involving
both
dentate
nuclei
of
cerebellum
and
splenium
of
corpus
callosum
.

The
diagnosis
of
metronidazole
toxicity
was
made
by
the
MRI
findings
and
supported
clinically
.

Aconitine
-induced

Ca
2
+
overload
causes

arrhythmia
and
triggers
apoptosis
through
p38

MAPK
signaling
pathway
in
rats
.

Aconitine
is
a
major
bioactive
diterpenoid
alkaloid
with
high
content
derived
from
herbal
aconitum
plants
.

Emerging
evidence
indicates
that
voltage
-
dependent
Na
(
+
)
channels
have
pivotal
roles
in
the
cardiotoxicity
of
aconitine
.

However
,
no
reports
are
available
on
the
role
of
Ca

(
2
+
)
in
aconitine

poisoning
.

In
this
study
,
we
explored
the
importance
of
pathological
Ca
(
2
+
)
signaling
in
aconitine
poisoning
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

We
found
that
Ca
(
2
+
)
overload
lead
to
accelerated
beating
rhythm
in
adult
rat
ventricular
myocytes
and
caused
arrhythmia
in
conscious
freely
moving
rats
.

To
investigate
effects
of
aconitine
on
myocardial
injury
,
we
performed
cytotoxicity
assay
in
neonatal
rat
ventricular
myocytes
(
NRVMs
)
,
as
well
as
measured
lactate
dehydrogenase
level
in
the
culture
medium
of
NRVMs
and
activities
of
serum
cardiac
enzymes
in
rats
.

The
results
showed
that
aconitine
resulted
in
myocardial
injury
and
reduced
NRVMs
viability
dose
-
dependently
.

To
confirm
the
pro
-
apoptotic
effects
,
we
performed
flow
cytometric
detection
,
cardiac
histology
,
transmission
electron
microscopy
and
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase
-
mediated
dUTP
-
biotin
nick
end
labeling
assay
.

The
results
showed
that
aconitine
stimulated
apoptosis
time
-
dependently
.

The
expression
analysis
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
handling
proteins
demonstrated
that
aconitine
promoted
Ca
(
2
+
)
overload
through
the
expression
regulation
of
Ca
(
2
+
)
handling
proteins
.

The
expression
analysis
of
apoptosis
-
related
proteins
revealed
that
pro
-
apoptotic
protein
expression
was
upregulated
,
and
anti
-
apoptotic
protein
BCL-2
expression
was
downregulated
.

Furthermore
,
increased
phosphorylation
of
MAPK
family
members
,
especially
the
P
-
P38/P38
ratio
was
found
in
cardiac
tissues
.

Hence
,
our
results
suggest
that
aconitine
significantly
aggravates
Ca
(
2
+
)
overload
and
causes
arrhythmia
and
finally
promotes
apoptotic
development
via
phosphorylation
of
P38
mitogen
-
activated
protein
kinase
.

Chronic
treatment
with
metformin
suppresses
toll
-
like
receptor
4
signaling
and
attenuates
left
ventricular
dysfunction
following
myocardial
infarction
.

Acute
treatment
with
metformin
has
a
protective
effect
in
myocardial
infarction
by
suppression
of
inflammatory
responses
due
to
activation
of
AMP

-activated
protein
kinase
(
AMPK
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
effect
of
chronic
pre
-
treatment
with
metformin
on
cardiac
dysfunction
and
toll
-
like
receptor
4
(
TLR4
)
activities
following
myocardial
infarction
and
their
relation
with
AMPK
were
assessed
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
randomly
assigned
to
one
of
5
groups
(
n=6
)
:
normal
control
and
groups
were
injected

isoproterenol
after
chronic
pre
-
treatment
with
0
,
25
,
50
,
or
100mg
/
kg
of

metformin
twice
daily
for
14
days
.

Isoproterenol
(
100mg
/
kg
)
was
injected
subcutaneously
on
the
13th
and
14th
days
to
induce
acute
myocardial
infarction
.

Isoproterenol
alone
decreased
left
ventricular
systolic
pressure
and
myocardial
contractility
indexed
as
LVdp
/
dtmax
and
LVdp
/
dtmin
.

The
left
ventricular
dysfunction
was
significantly
lower
in
the
groups
treated
with
25
and
50mg
/
kg
of
metformin
.

Metfromin
markedly
lowered
isoproterenol
-induced
elevation
in
the
levels
of
TLR4
mRNA
,
myeloid
differentiation
protein
88
(
MyD88
)
,
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
(
TNF
-
a
)
,
and
interleukin
6
(
IL-6
)
in
the
heart
tissues
.

Similar
changes
were
also
seen
in
the
serum
levels
of
TNF
-
a
and
IL-6
.

However
,
the
lower
doses
of
25
and
50mg
/
kg
were
more
effective
than
100mg
/
kg
.

Phosphorylated
AMPKa
(
p
-
AMPK
)
in
the
myocardium
was
significantly
elevated
by
25mg
/
kg
of
metformin
,
slightly
by
50mg
/
kg
,
but
not
by
100mg
/
kg
.

Chronic
pre
-
treatment
with
metformin
reduces
post-
myocardial
infarction
cardiac
dysfunction
and
suppresses
inflammatory
responses
,
possibly
through
inhibition
of
TLR4
activities
.

This
mechanism
can
be
considered
as
a
target
to
protect
infarcted
myocardium
.

Neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
induced
by
combination
therapy
with
tetrabenazine
and
tiapride
in
a
Japanese
patient
with
Huntington
's
disease
at
the
terminal
stage
of
recurrent
breast
cancer
.

We
herein
describe
the
case
of
an
81-year
-
old
Japanese
woman
with
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
that
occurred
36
days
after
the
initiation
of
combination
therapy
with
tiapride

(
75
mg
/
day
)
and
tetrabenazine
(
12.5
mg
/
day
)
for
Huntington
's
disease
.

The
patient
had
been
treated
with
tiapride
or
tetrabenazine
alone
without
any
adverse
effects
before
the
administration
of
the
combination
therapy
.

She
also
had
advanced

breast
cancer
when
the
combination
therapy
was
initiated
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
the
occurrence
of
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
due
to
combination
therapy
with
tetrabenazine
and
tiapride
has
not
been
previously
reported
.

Tetrabenazine
should
be
administered
very
carefully
in
combination
with
other
neuroleptic
drugs
,
particularly
in
patients
with
a
worsening
general
condition
.

A
metoprolol
-
terbinafine
combination
induced
bradycardia
.

To
report
a
sinus
bradycardia
induced
by
metoprolol
and
terbinafine
drug
-
drug
interaction
and
its
management
.

A
63
year
-
old
Caucasian
man
on
metoprolol
200
mg
/
day
for
stable
coronary
artery
disease
was
prescribed
a
90-day
course
of
oral
terbinafine
250
mg
/
day
for
onychomycosis
.

On
the
49th
day
of
terbinafine
therapy
,
he
was
brought
to
the
emergency
room
for
a
decrease
of
his
global
health
status
,
confusion
and
falls
.

The
electrocardiogram
revealed
a
37
beats
/
min
sinus
bradycardia
.

A
score
of
7
on
the
Naranjo
adverse
drug
reaction
probability
scale
indicates
a
probable
relationship
between
the
patient
's
sinus
bradycardia
and
the
drug
interaction
between
metoprolol
and
terbinafine
.

The
heart
rate
ameliorated
first
with
a
decrease
in
the
dose
of
metoprolol
.

It
was
subsequently
changed
to
bisoprolol
and
the
heart
rate
remained
normal
.

By
inhibiting
the
cytochrome
P450
2D6
,
terbinafine
had
decreased
metoprolol
's
clearance
,
leading
in
metoprolol
accumulation
which
has
resulted
in
clinically
significant
sinus
bradycardia
.

Optochiasmatic
and
peripheral
neuropathy
due
to
ethambutol
overtreatment
.

Ethambutol
is
known
to
cause
optic
neuropathy
and
,
more
rarely
,
axonal
polyneuropathy
.

We
characterize
the
clinical
,
neurophysiological
,
and
neuroimaging
findings
in
a
72-year
-
old
man
who
developed
visual
loss
and
paresthesias
after
11
weeks
of
exposure
to
a
supratherapeutic
dose
of
ethambutol
.

This
case
demonstrates
the
selective
vulnerability
of
the
anterior
visual
pathways
and
peripheral
nerves
to
ethambutol
toxicity
.

Testosterone
ameliorates

streptozotocin
-induced

memory
impairment
in
male
rats
.

AIM
:
To
study
the
effects
of
testosterone
on
streptozotocin

(
STZ
)
-induced

memory
impairment
in
male
rats
.

METHODS
:

Adult
male
Wistar
rats
were
intracerebroventricularly
(
icv
)
infused
with
STZ
(
750
ug
)
on
d
1
and
d
3
,
and
a
passive
avoidance
task
was
assessed
2
weeks
after
the
first
injection
of
STZ
.

Castration
surgery
was
performed
in
another
group
of
rats
,
and
the
passive
avoidance
task
was
assessed
4
weeks
after
the
operation
.

Testosterone

(
1
mg.kg(-1).d(-1
)
,
sc
)
,
the
androgen
receptor
antagonist
flutamide

(
10
mg.kg(-1).d(-1
)
,
ip
)
,
the
estrogen
receptor
antagonist
tamoxifen

(
1
mg.kg(-1).d(-1
)
,
ip
)
or
the
aromatase
inhibitor
letrozole

(
4
mg.kg(-1).d(-1
)
,
ip
)
were
administered
for
6
d
after
the
first
injection
of
STZ
.

RESULTS
:

STZ
administration
and
castration
markedly
decreased
both
STL1
(
the
short
memory
)
and
STL2
(
the
long
memory
)
in
passive
avoidance
tests
.

Testosterone
replacement
almost
restored
the
STL1
and
STL2
in
castrated
rats
,
and
significantly
prolonged
the
STL1
and
STL2
in
STZ
-treated
rats
.

Administration
of
flutamide
,
letrozole
or
tamoxifen
significantly
impaired
the
memory
in
intact
rats
,
and
significantly
attenuated
the
testosterone
replacement
in
improving
STZ
-
and
castration
-
induced
memory
impairment
.

CONCLUSION
:

Testosterone
administration
ameliorates
STZ
-
and
castration
-
induced
memory
impairment
in
male
Wistar
rats
.

Behavioral

Mart
.

It
is
widely
used
in

However
,
there
is
no

Hippocampus
mice
treated
with
GFC75
plus
P400
showed
an
increase
in
AChE
activity
(
63.30
%
)
when
compared
with
seized
mice
.

The
results
indicate
that
GFC
can
exert
anticonvulsant
activity
and
reduce
the
frequency
of
installation
of
pilocarpine
-induced
status
epilepticus
,
as
demonstrated
by
increase
in
latency
to
first
seizure
and
decrease
in
mortality
rate
of
animals
.

In
conclusion
,
our
data
suggest
that
GFC
may
influence
in
epileptogenesis
and
promote
anticonvulsant
actions
in
pilocarpine
model
by
modulating
the
GABA
and
glutamate
contents
and
of
AChE
activity
in
seized
mice
hippocampus
.

This
compound
may
be
useful
to
produce
neuronal
protection
and
it
can
be
considered
as
an
anticonvulsant
agent
.

Standard

observational
study
.

INTRODUCTION
:

Acute
kidney
injury

(
AKI
)
occurs
in
7
%
of
hospitalized
and
66
%
of
Intensive
Care
Unit
(
ICU
)
patients
.

It
increases
mortality
,
hospital
length
of
stay
,
and
costs
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
,
whether
there
is
an
association
between
adherence
to
guidelines
(
standard
operating
procedures
(
SOP
)
)
for
potentially
nephrotoxic
antibiotics
and
the
occurrence
of
AKI
.

METHODS
:

This
study
was
carried
out
as
a
prospective
,
clinical
,
non
-
interventional
,
observational
study
.

Data
collection
was
performed
over
a
total
of
170
days
in
three
ICUs
at
Charite
-
Universitaetsmedizin
Berlin
.

A
total
of
675
patients
were
included
;
163
of
these
had
therapy
with
vancomycin
,
gentamicin
,
or
tobramycin
;
were
>
18
years
;
and
treated
in
the
ICU
for
>
24
hours
.

Patients
with
an
adherence
to
SOP
>
70
%
were
classified
into
the
high
adherence
group
(
HAG
)
and
patients
with
an
adherence
of
70
%
into
the
low
adherence
group
(
LAG
)
.

AKI
was
defined
according
to
RIFLE
criteria
.

Adherence
to
SOPs
was
evaluated
by
retrospective
expert
audit
.

Development
of
AKI
was
compared
between
groups
with
exact
Chi2-test
and
multivariate
logistic
regression
analysis
(
two
-
sided
P
0.05
)
.

RESULTS
:

LAG
consisted
of
75
patients
(
46
%
)
versus
88
HAG
patients
(
54
%
)
.

AKI
occurred
significantly
more
often
in
LAG
with
36
%
versus
21
%
in
HAG
(
P
=
0.035
)
.

Basic
characteristics
were
comparable
,
except
an
increased
rate
of
soft
tissue
infections
in
LAG
.

Multivariate
analysis
revealed
an
odds
ratio
of
2.5-fold
for
LAG
to
develop
AKI
compared
with
HAG
(
95
%
confidence
interval
1.195
to
5.124
,
P
=
0.039
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

Low
adherence
to
SOPs
for
potentially
nephrotoxic
antibiotics
was
associated
with
a
higher
occurrence
of
AKI
.

Rhabdomyolysis
in
a
hepatitis
C
virus
infected
patient
treated
with
telaprevir
and
simvastatin
.

A
46-year
old
man
with
a
chronic
hepatitis
C
virus
infection
received
triple
therapy
with
ribavirin
,
pegylated
interferon
and
telaprevir
.

The
patient
also
received
simvastatin
.

One
month
after
starting
the
antiviral
therapy
,
the
patient
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
because
he
developed
rhabdomyolysis
.

At
admission
simvastatin
and
all
antiviral
drugs
were
discontinued
because
toxicity
due
to
a
drug
-
drug
interaction
was
suspected
.

The
creatine
kinase
peaked
at
62,246
IU
/
L
and
the
patient
was
treated
with
intravenous
normal
saline
.

The
patient
's
renal
function
remained
unaffected
.

Fourteen
days
after
hospitalization
,
creatine
kinase
level
had
returned
to
230
IU
/
L
and
the
patient
was
discharged
.

Telaprevir
was
considered
the
probable
causative
agent
of
an
interaction
with
simvastatin
according
to
the
Drug
Interaction
Probability
Scale
.

The
interaction
is
due
to
inhibition
of
CYP3A4-mediated
simvastatin
clearance
.

Simvastatin
plasma
concentration
increased
30
times
in
this
patient
and
statin
induced

muscle
toxicity
is
related
to
the
concentration
of
the
statin
in
blood
.

In
conclusion
,
with
this
case
we
illustrate
that
telaprevir
as
well
as
statins
are
susceptible
to
clinical
relevant
drug
-
drug
interactions
.

Combination

in
Japanese
patients
.

Consolidation
therapy
for
patients
with
multiple
myeloma

(
MM
)
has
been
widely
adopted
to
improve
treatment
response
following
autologous
stem
cell
transplantation
.

In
this
study
,
we
retrospectively
analyzed
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
combination
regimen
of
bortezomib
,
thalidomide
,
and
dexamethasone
(
VTD
)
as
consolidation
therapy
in
24
Japanese
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
MM
.

VTD
consisted
of
bortezomib
at
a
dose
of
1.3
mg
/
m(2
)
and
dexamethasone
at
a
dose
of
40
mg
/
day
on
days
1
,
8
,
15
,
and
22
of
a
35-day
cycle
,
with
daily
oral
thalidomide
at
a
dose
of
100
mg
/
day
.

Grade
3
-
4
neutropenia
and
thrombocytopenia
were
documented
in
four
and
three
patients
(
17
and
13
%
)
,
respectively
,
but
drug
dose
reduction
due
to
cytopenia
was
not
required
in
any
case
.

Peripheral
neuropathy
was
common
(
63
%
)
,
but
severe
grade
3
-
4
peripheral
neuropathy
was
not
observed
.

Very
good
partial
response
or
better
response
(
>
VGPR
)
rates
before
and
after
consolidation
therapy
were
54
and
79
%
,
respectively
.

Patients
had
a
significant
probability
of
improving
from
VGPR
before
consolidation
therapy
to
>
VGPR
after
consolidation
therapy
(
p
=
0.041
)
.

The
VTD
regimen
may
be
safe
and
effective
as
a
consolidation
therapy
in
the
treatment
of
MM
in
Japanese
population
.

Conversion
to
sirolimus
ameliorates

cyclosporine
-induced

nephropathy
in
the
rat
:
focus

biomarkers
.

Protocols
of
conversion
from
cyclosporin
A

(
CsA
)
to
sirolimus

(
SRL
)
have
been
widely
used
in
immunotherapy
after
transplantation
to
prevent
CsA

-induced

nephropathy
,
but
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
these
protocols
remain
nuclear
.

This
study
aimed
to
identify
the
molecular
pathways
and
putative
biomarkers
of

CsA
-to-
SRL
conversion
in
a
rat
model
.

Four
animal
groups
(
n
=
6
)
were
tested
during
9
weeks
:
control
,
CsA
,
SRL
,
and
conversion
(
CsA
for
3
weeks
followed
by
SRL
for
6
weeks
)
.

Classical
and
emergent
serum
,
urinary
,
and
kidney
tissue
(
gene
and
protein
expression
)

markers
were
assessed
.

Renal
lesions
were
analyzed
in
hematoxylin
and
eosin
,
periodic
acid
-
Schiff
,
and
Masson
's
trichrome
stains
.

SRL

-treated
rats
presented
proteinuria
and
NGAL
(
serum
and
urinary
)
as
the
best
markers
of
renal
impairment
.

Short
CsA
treatment
presented
slight
or
even
absent
kidney
lesions
and
TGF
-
b
,
NF-
kb
,
mTOR
,
PCNA
,
TP53
,
KIM-1
,
and
CTGF
as
relevant
gene
and
protein
changes
.

Prolonged
CsA
exposure
aggravated
renal
damage
,
without
clear
changes
on
the
traditional
markers
,
but
with
changes
in
serums
TGF-
b
and
IL-7
,
TBARs
clearance
,
and

.
Conversion
to
SRL
prevented
CsA

-induced

renal
damage
evolution
(
absent
/
mild
grade

)
,
while
NGAL
(
serum
versus

)
seems
to
be
a
feasible
biomarker
of
CsA
replacement
to
SRL
.

Kinin
B2
receptor
deletion
and
blockage
ameliorates

cisplatin
-induced

acute
renal
injury
.

Cisplatin
treatment
has
been
adopted
in
some
chemotherapies
;
however
,
this
drug
can
induce
acute
kidney
injury
due
its
ability
to
negatively
affect
renal
function
,
augment
serum
levels
of
creatinine
and
urea
,
increase
the
acute
tubular
necrosis
score
and
up
-
regulate
cytokines
(
e.g.
,
IL-1b
and
TNF
-
a
)
.

The
kinin
B2
receptor
has
been
associated
with
the
inflammation
process
,
as
well
as
the
regulation
of
cytokine
expression
,
and
its
deletion
resulted
in
an
improvement
in
the
diabetic
nephropathy
status
.

To
examine
the
role
of
the
kinin
B2
receptor
in
cisplatin

-induced

acute
kidney
injury
,
kinin
B2
receptor
knockout
mice
were
challenged
with
cisplatin
.

Additionally
,
WT
mice
were
treated
with
a
B2
receptor
antagonist
after
cisplatin
administration
.

B2
receptor
-
deficient
mice
were
less
sensitive
to
this
drug
than
the
WT
mice
,
as
shown
by
reduced
weight
loss
,
better
preservation
of
kidney
function
,
down
regulation
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
less
acute
tubular
necrosis
.

Moreover
,
treatment
with
the
kinin
B2
receptor
antagonist
effectively
reduced
the
levels
of
serum
creatinine
and
blood
urea
after
cisplatin
administration
.

Thus
,
our
data
suggest
that
the
kinin
B2
receptor
is
involved
in
cisplatin
-induced
acute
kidney
injury
by
mediating
the
necrotic
process
and
the
expression
of
inflammatory
cytokines
,
thus
resulting
in
declined
renal
function
.

These
results
highlight
the
kinin
B2
receptor
antagonist
treatment
in
amelioration
of
nephrotoxicity
induced
by
cisplatin
therapy
.

.

PURPOSE
:

To
report
the
treatment
outcomes
of
the
fluocinolone
acetonide
intravitreal
implant
(
0.59
mg
)
in
patients
with
birdshot
retinochoroidopathy
whose
disease
is
refractory
or
intolerant
to
conventional
immunomodulatory
therapy
.

METHODS
:

A
retrospective
case
series
involving
11
birdshot
retinochoroidopathy
patients
(
11
eyes
)
.

Eleven
patients
(
11
eyes
)
underwent
surgery
for
fluocinolone
acetonide
implant
(
0.59
mg
)
.

Treatment
outcomes
of
interest
were
noted
at

,
before
fluocinolone
acetonide
implant
,
and
then
at
6
months
,
1
year
,
2
years
,
3
years
,
and
beyond
3
years
.

were
recorded
.

Data
on
occurrence
of
cataract
and
raised
intraocular
pressure
were
collected
in
all
eyes
.

RESULTS
:

Intraocular
inflammation
was
present
in
54.5
,
9.9
,
11.1
,
and
0
%
of
patients
at

,
2
years
,
3
years
,
and
beyond
3
years
after
receiving
the
implant
,
respectively
.

Active
vasculitis
was
noted
in
36.3
%
patients
at
baseline
and
0
%
at
3
years
of
follow
-
up
.

More
than
20
%
(
47.61
-
67.2
%
)
reduction
in
central

was
noted
in
all
patients
with
cystoid
macular
edema
at
6
months
,
1
year
,
2
years
,
and
3
years
postimplant
.

At
baseline
,
54.5
%
patients
were
on
immunomodulatory
agents
.

This
percentage
decreased
to
45.45
,
44.4
,
and
14.28
%
at
1
year
,
2
years
,
and
3
years

,
respectively
.

Adverse
events
included
increased
intraocular
pressure
(
54.5
%
)
and
cataract
formation
(
100
%
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
data
suggest
that
fluocinolone
acetonide
implant
(
0.59
mg
)
helps
to
control
inflammation
in
otherwise
treatment
-
refractory
cases
of
birdshot
retinochoroidopathy
.

It
is
associated
with
significant
side
effects
of

Optimal
precurarizing
dose
of
rocuronium
to
decrease

fasciculation
and
myalgia
following
succinylcholine
administration
.

BACKGROUND
:

Succinylcholine
commonly
produces
frequent
adverse
effects
,
including
muscle
fasciculation
and
myalgia
.

The
current
study
identified
the
optimal
dose
of
rocuronium
to
prevent
succinylcholine
-induced
fasciculation
and
myalgia
and
evaluated
the
influence
of
rocuronium
on
the
speed
of
onset
produced
by
succinylcholine
.

METHODS
:

This
randomized
,
double
-
blinded
study
was
conducted
in
100
patients
randomly
allocated
into
five
groups
of
20
patients
each
.

Patients
were
randomized
to
receive
0.02
,
0.03
,
0.04
,
0.05
and
0.06
mg
/
kg

rocuronium
as
a
precurarizing
dose
.

Neuromuscular
monitoring
after
each
precurarizing
dose
was
recorded
from
the
adductor
pollicis
muscle
using
acceleromyography
with
train
-
of
-
four
stimulation
of
the
ulnar
nerve
.

All
patients
received

succinylcholine
1.5
mg
/
kg
at
2
minutes
after
the
precurarization
,
and
were
assessed
the
incidence
and
severity
of
fasciculations
,
while
myalgia
was
assessed
at
24
hours
after
surgery
.

RESULTS
:

The
incidence
and
severity
of
visible
muscle
fasciculation
was
significantly
less
with
increasing
the
amount
of
precurarizing
dose
of
rocuronium

(
P
0.001
)
.

Those
of
myalgia
tend
to
decrease
according
to
increasing
the
amount
of
precurarizing
dose
of
rocuronium
,
but
there
was
no
significance
(
P
=
0.072
)
.

The
onset
time
of
succinylcholine
was
significantly
longer
with
increasing
the
amount
of
precurarizing
dose
of
rocuronium

(
P
0.001
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Precurarization
with
0.04
mg
/
kg

rocuronium
was
the
optimal
dose
considering
the
reduction
in
the
incidence
and
severity
of
fasciculation
and
myalgia
with
acceptable
onset
time
,
and
the
safe
and
effective
precurarization
.

Absence
of
PKC
-
alpha
attenuates
lithium
-induced
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
.

Lithium
,
an
effective
antipsychotic
,
induces
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus

(
NDI
)
in
40
%
of
patients
.

The
decreased
capacity
to
concentrate
urine
is
likely
due
to
lithium
acutely
disrupting
the
cAMP
pathway
and
chronically
reducing
urea
transporter
(
UT
-
A1
)
and
water
channel
(
AQP2
)
expression
in
the
inner
medulla
.

Targeting
an
alternative
signaling
pathway
,
such
as
PKC
-
mediated
signaling
,
may
be
an
effective
method
of
treating
lithium
-induced

polyuria
.

PKC
-
alpha
null
mice
(
PKCa

)
and
strain
-
matched
wild
type
(
WT
)
controls
were
treated
with
lithium
for
0
,
3
or
5
days
.

WT
mice
had
increased
urine
output
and
lowered
urine
osmolality
after
3
and
5
days
of
treatment
whereas
PKCa
KO
mice
had
no
change
in
urine
output
or
concentration
.

Western
blot
analysis
revealed
that
AQP2
expression
in
medullary
tissues
was
lowered
after
3
and
5
days
in
WT
mice
;
however
,
AQP2
was
unchanged
in
PKCa
KO
.

Similar
results
were
observed
with
UT
-
A1
expression
.

Animals
were
also
treated
with
lithium
for
6
weeks
.

Lithium

WT
mice
had
19-fold
increased
urine
output
whereas
treated
PKCa
KO
animals
had
a
4-fold
increase
in
output
.

AQP2
and
UT
-
A1
expression
was
lowered
in
6
week
lithium

WT
animals
whereas
in
treated
PKCa
KO
mice
,
AQP2
was
only
reduced
by
2-fold
and
UT

A1
expression
was
unaffected
.

Is
Dysguesia

Going
to
be
a
Rare
or
a
Common
Side
-
effect
of
Amlodipine
?

A
very
rare
side
-
effect
of
amlodipine
is
dysguesia
.

A
review
of
the
literature
produced
only
one
case
.

We
report
a
case
about
a
female
with
essential
hypertension
on
drug
treatment
with
amlodipine
developed
loss
of
taste
sensation
.

Condition
moderately
improved
on
stoppage
of
the
drug
for
25
days
.

We
conclude
that
amlodipine
can
cause
dysguesia
.

Here
,
we
describe
the
clinical
presentation
and
review
the
relevant
literature
on
amlodipine
and
dysguesia
.

Rhabdomyolysis
in
association
with
simvastatin
and
dosage
increment
in
clarithromycin
.

Clarithromycin
is
the
most
documented
cytochrome
P450
3A4
(
CYP3A4
)
inhibitor
to
cause
an
adverse
interaction
with
simvastatin
.

This
particular
case
is
of
interest
as
rhabdomyolysis
only
occurred
after
an
increase
in
the
dose
of
clarithromycin
.

The
patient
developed
raised
cardiac
biomarkers
without
any
obvious
cardiac
issues
,
a
phenomenon
that
has
been
linked
to
rhabdomyolysis
previously
.

To
date
,
there
has
been
no
reported
effect
of
rhabdomyolysis
on
the
structure
and
function
of
cardiac
muscle
.

Clinicians
need
to
be
aware
of
prescribing
concomitant
medications
that
increase
the
risk
of
myopathy
or
inhibit
the
CYP3A4
enzyme
.

Our
case
suggests
that
troponin
elevation
could
be
associated
with
statin
induced
rhabdomyolysis
,
which
may
warrant
further
studies
.

Characterization

is
characterized
by

after
the
use
of
muscle
relaxants
(
suxamethonium
or
mivacurium
)
in
patients
who
have

in
the
BCHE
gene
.

Here
,
we
report
a
case
of
prolonged
neuromuscular

leading
to
the
discovery
of
a
novel
BCHE
variant
(

)
.

Inhibition
studies
,
kinetic

and
molecular

were
undertaken
to
understand
how
this

disrupts
the
catalytic

and
determines
a

.

Low

fit
with

.

Electrophoretic

BChE
of
the

showed
that

and
that

and
a

are
consistent
with
the
absence
of

.

Molecular

showed
that
the
overall
effect
of
the

Val204Asp
is
disruption
of

artesunate
,
the
current
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO)-recommended
first

line
drug
for
the
treatment
of
severe
malaria
.

A
total
of
350
patients
(
215
[
61.4
%
]
5
years
of
age
and
135
[

in
hospitals
and
health
centers
of
the
Democratic

Regulation
of
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
3
and
apoptotic
pathways
by
betaine
attenuates

isoproterenol
-induced
acute
myocardial
injury
in
rats
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
cardioprotective
effects
of
betaine
on
acute
myocardial
ischemia
induced
experimentally
in
rats
focusing
on
regulation
of
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
3
(
STAT3
)
and
apoptotic
pathways
as
the
potential
mechanism
underlying
the
drug
effect
.

Male
Sprague
Dawley
rats
were
treated
with
betaine

(
100
,
200
,
and
400
mg
/
kg
)
orally
for
40
days
.

Acute
myocardial
ischemic
injury
was
induced
in
rats
by
subcutaneous
injection
of
isoproterenol

(
85
mg
/
kg
)
,
for
two
consecutive
days
.

Serum
cardiac
marker
enzyme
,
histopathological
variables
and
expression
of
protein
levels
were
analyzed
.

Oral
administration
of
betaine

(
200
and
400
mg
/
kg
)
significantly
reduced
the
level
of
cardiac
marker
enzyme
in
the
serum
and
prevented
left
ventricular
remodeling
.

Western
blot
analysis
showed
that
isoproterenol
-induced
phosphorylation
of
STAT3
was
maintained
or
further
enhanced
by
betaine
treatment
in
myocardium
.

Furthermore
,
betaine
(
200
and
400
mg
/
kg
)
treatment
increased
the
ventricular
expression
of
Bcl-2
and
reduced
the
level
of
Bax
,
therefore
causing
a
significant
increase
in
the
ratio
of
Bcl-2/Bax
.

The
protective
role
of
betaine
on
myocardial
damage
was
further
confirmed
by
histopathological
examination
.

In
summary
,
our
results
showed
that
betaine
pretreatment
attenuated

isoproterenol
-induced
acute
myocardial
ischemia
via
the
regulation
of
STAT3
and
apoptotic

Quetiapine
-induced
neutropenia
in
a
bipolar
patient
with
hepatocellular
carcinoma
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Quetiapine
is
a
dibenzothiazepine
derivative
,
similar
to
clozapine
,
which
has
the
highest
risk
of
causing
blood
dyscrasias
,
especially
neutropenia
.

There
are
some
case
reports
about
this
side
effect
of
quetiapine
,
but
possible
risk
factors
are
seldom
discussed
and
identified
.

A
case
of
a
patient
with
hepatocellular
carcinoma
that
developed
neutropenia
after
treatment
with
quetiapine
is
described
here
.

CASE
REPORT
:

A
62-year
-
old
Taiwanese
widow
with
bipolar
disorder
was
diagnosed
with
hepatocellular
carcinoma
at
age
60
.

She
developed
leucopenia
after
being
treated
with
quetiapine
.

After
quetiapine
was
discontinued
,
her
white
blood
cell
count
returned
to
normal
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Although
neutropenia
is
not
a
common
side
effect
of
quetiapine
,
physicians
should
be
cautious
about
its
presentation
and
associated
risk
factors
.

Hepatic
dysfunction
may
be
one
of
the
possible
risk
factors
,
and
concomitant
fever
may
be
a
diagnostic
marker
for
adverse
reaction
to
quetiapine
.

Lateral
antebrachial
cutaneous
neuropathy
after
steroid
injection
at
lateral
epicondyle
.

BACKGROUND
AND
OBJECTIVES
:

This
report
aimed
to
present
a
case
of
lateral
antebrachial
cutaneous
neuropathy

(
LACNP
)
that
occurred
after
a
steroid
injection
in
the
lateral
epicondyle
to
treat
lateral
epicondylitis
in
a
40-year
-
old
woman
.

MATERIAL
AND
METHOD
:

A
40-year
-
old
woman
presented
with
decreased
sensation
and
paresthesia
over
her
right
lateral
forearm
;
the
paresthesia
had
occurred
after
a
steroid
injection
in
the
right
lateral
epicondyle
3
months
before
.

Her
sensation
of
light
touch
and
pain
was
diminished
over
the
lateral
side
of
the
right
forearm
and
wrist
area
.

RESULTS
:

The
sensory
action
potential
amplitude
of
the
right
lateral
antebrachial
cutaneous
nerve
(
LACN
)
(
6.2
uV
)
was
lower
than
that
of
the
left
(
13.1
uV
)
.

The
difference
of
amplitude
between
both
sides
was
significant
because
there
was
more
than
a
50
%
reduction
.

She
was
diagnosed
with
right
LACNP
(
mainly
axonal
involvement
)
on
the
basis
of
the
clinical
manifestation
and
the
electrodiagnostic
findings
.

Her
symptoms
improved
through
physical
therapy
but
persisted
to
some
degree
.

CONCLUSION
:

This
report
describes
the
case
of
a
woman
with
LACNP
that
developed
after
a
steroid
injection
for
the
treatment
of
lateral
epicondylitis
.

An
electrodiagnostic
study
,
including
a
nerve
conduction
study
of
the
LACN
,
was
helpful
to
diagnose
right
LACNP
and
to
find
the
passage
of
the
LACN
on
the
lateral
epicondyle
.

Curcumin
prevents
maleate

-induced

nephrotoxicity
:
relation
to
hemodynamic
alterations
,
oxidative
stress
,
mitochondrial
oxygen
consumption
and
activity
of
respiratory
complex
I.

The
potential
protective
effect
of
the
dietary
antioxidant
curcumin

(
120
mg
/
Kg
/
day
for
6
days
)
against
the
renal
injury
induced
by
maleate
was
evaluated
.

Tubular
proteinuria
and

oxidative
stress
were
induced
by
a
single
injection
of
maleate

(
400
mg
/
kg
)
in
rats
.

Maleate
-induced

renal
injury
included
increase
in
renal
vascular
resistance
and
in
the
urinary
excretion
of
total
protein
,
glucose
,
sodium
,
neutrophil
gelatinase
-
associated
lipocalin
(
NGAL
)
and
N
-
acetyl
b
-
D
-
glucosaminidase
(
NAG
)
,
upregulation
of
kidney
injury
molecule
(
KIM)-1
,
decrease
in
renal
blood
flow
and
claudin-2
expression
besides
of
necrosis
and
apoptosis
of
tubular
cells
on
24
h.
Oxidative
stress
was
determined
by
measuring
the
oxidation
of
lipids
and
proteins
and
diminution
in
renal
Nrf2
levels
.

Studies
were
also
conducted
in
renal
epithelial
LLC
-
PK1
cells
and
in
mitochondria
isolated
from
kidneys
of
all
the
experimental
groups
.

Maleate
induced
cell
damage
and
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
production
in
LLC
-
PK1
cells
in
culture
.

In
addition
,
maleate
treatment
reduced
oxygen
consumption
in
ADP

-stimulated
mitochondria
and
diminished
respiratory
control
index
when
using
malate
/
glutamate
as
substrate
.

The
activities
of
both
complex
I
and
aconitase
were
also
diminished
.

All
the
above
-
described
alterations
were
prevented
by
curcumin
.

It
is
concluded
that
curcumin
is
able
to
attenuate
in
vivo
maleate

-induced

nephropathy
and
in
vitro
cell
damage
.

The
in
vivo
protection
was
associated
to
the
prevention
of
oxidative
stress
and
preservation
of
mitochondrial
oxygen
consumption
and
activity
of
respiratory
complex
I
,
and
the
in
vitro
protection
was
associated
to
the
prevention
of
ROS
production
.

Incidence
of

among
pesticide
applicators
exposed
to
the
organophosphate
insecticide
diazinon
in
the
Agricultural
Health
Study
:
an
updated
analysis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Diazinon
,
a
common
organophosphate
insecticide
with
genotoxic
properties
,
was
previously
associated
with
lung
cancer
in
the
Agricultural
Health
Study
(
AHS
)
cohort
,
but
few
other
epidemiological
studies
have
examined
diazinon
-associated
cancer
risk
.

We
used
updated
diazinon
exposure
and
cancer
incidence
information
to
evaluate
solid
tumour
risk
in
the
AHS
.

METHODS
:

Male
pesticide
applicators
in
Iowa
and
North
Carolina
reported
lifetime
diazinon
use
at
enrolment
(
1993
-
1997
)
and
follow
-
up
(
1998
-
2005
)
;

cancer
incidence
was
assessed
through
2010(North
Carolina)/2011(Iowa
)
.

Among
applicators
with
usage
information
sufficient
to
evaluate
exposure
-
response
patterns
,
we
used
Poisson
regression
to
estimate
adjusted
rate
ratios
(
RRs
)
and
95
%
CI
for
cancer

sites
with
>
10
exposed
cases
for
both
lifetime
(
LT
)
exposure
days
and
intensity
-
weighted
(
IW
)
lifetime
exposure
days
(
accounting
for
factors
impacting
exposure
)
.

RESULTS
:

We
observed
elevated
lung
cancer
risks
(
N=283
)
among
applicators
with
the
greatest
number
of
LT
(
RR=1.60
;
95
%
CI
1.11
to
2.31
;
Ptrend=0.02
)
and
IW
days
of
diazinon
use
(
RR=1.41
;
95
%
CI
0.98
to
2.04
;
Ptrend=0.08
)
.

Kidney

(
N=94
)
risks
were
non

significantly
elevated
(
RRLT
days=1.77
;
95

to
2.92
;
Ptrend=0.50
)
,
as
were
risks
for
aggressive
prostate
cancer
(
N=656
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Our
updated
evaluation
of
diazinon
provides
additional
evidence
of
an
association
with
lung
cancer
risk
.

Newly
identified
links
to
kidney

Associations
of
Ozone
and
PM2.5
Concentrations
With
Parkinson
's
Disease

Among
Participants
in
the
Agricultural
Health
Study
.

OBJECTIVE
:

This
study
describes
associations
of
ozone
and
fine
particulate
matter
with
Parkinson
's
disease
observed
among
farmers
in
North
Carolina
and
Iowa
.

METHODS
:

We
used
logistic
regression
to
determine
the
associations
of
these
pollutants
with
self
-
reported
,
doctor
-
diagnosed
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Daily
predicted
pollutant
concentrations
were
used
to
derive
surrogates
of
long
-
term
exposure
and
link
them
to
study
participants
'
geocoded
addresses
.

RESULTS
:

We
observed
positive
associations
of
Parkinson
's
disease
with
ozone

(
odds
ratio
=
1.39
;
95
%
CI
:
0.98
to
1.98
)
and
fine
particulate
matter

(
odds
ratio
=
1.34
;
95
%
CI
:
0.93
to
1.93
)
in
North
Carolina
but
not
in
Iowa
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
plausibility
of
an
effect
of
ambient
concentrations
of
these
pollutants
on
Parkinson
's
disease
risk
is
supported
by
experimental
data
demonstrating
damage
to
dopaminergic
neurons
at
relevant
concentrations
.

Additional
studies
are
needed
to
address
uncertainties
related
to
confounding
and
to
examine
temporal
aspects
of
the
associations
we
observed
.

Low
functional
programming
of
renal
AT2R
mediates
the
developmental
origin
of
glomerulosclerosis
in
adult
offspring
induced
by
prenatal
caffeine
exposure
.

UNASSIGNED
:

Our
previous
study
has
indicated
that
prenatal

caffeine
exposure
(
PCE
)
could
induce
intrauterine
growth
retardation

(
IUGR
)
of
offspring
.

Recent
research
suggested
that
IUGR
is
a
risk
factor
for
glomerulosclerosis
.

However
,
whether
PCE
could
induce

glomerulosclerosis
and
its
underlying
mechanisms
remain
unknown
.

This
study
aimed
to
demonstrate
the
induction
to
glomerulosclerosis
in
adult
offspring
by
PCE
and
its
intrauterine
programming
mechanisms
.

A
rat
model
of
IUGR
was
established
by
PCE
,
male
fetuses
and
adult
offspring
at
the
age
of
postnatal
week
24
were
euthanized
.

The
results
revealed
that
the
adult
offspring
kidneys
in
the
PCE
group
exhibited
glomerulosclerosis
as
well
as
interstitial
fibrosis
,
accompanied
by
elevated
levels
of
serum
creatinine
and
urine
protein
.

Renal
angiotensin
II

receptor
type
2
(
AT2R
)
gene
expression
in
adult
offspring
was
reduced
by
PCE
,
whereas
the
renal
angiotensin
II
receptor
type

AT1aR)/AT2R
expression
ratio
was
increased
.

The
fetal
kidneys
in
the
PCE
group
displayed
an
enlarged
Bowman
's
space
and
a
shrunken
glomerular
tuft
,
accompanied
by
a
reduced
cortex
width
and
an
increase
in
the
nephrogenic
zone
/
cortical
zone
ratio
.

Observation
by
electronic
microscope
revealed
structural
damage
of
podocytes
;
the
reduced
expression
level
of
podocyte
marker
genes
,
nephrin
and
podocin
,
was
also
detected
by
q
-
PCR
.

Moreover
,
AT2R
gene
and
protein
expressions
in
fetal
kidneys
were
inhibited
by
PCE
,
associated
with
the
repression
of
the
gene
expression
of
glial

cell
-
line
-
derived
neurotrophic
factor
(
GDNF)/
tyrosine
kinase

.

These
results
demonstrated
that
PCE
could
induce
dysplasia
of
fetal
kidneys
as
well
as
glomerulosclerosis
of
adult
offspring
,
and
the
low
functional
programming
of
renal
AT2R
might
mediate
the
developmental
origin
of

1,3-Butadiene
,
CML
and
the
t(9:22
)

translocation
:

A
reality
check
.

UNASSIGNED
:

Epidemiological
studies
of
1,3-butadiene
have
suggest
that
exposures
to
humans
are
associated
with
chronic
myeloid
leukemia

(
CML
)
.

CML
has
a
well
-
documented
association
with
ionizing
radiation
,
but
reports
of
associations
with
chemical
exposures
have
been
questioned
.

Ionizing
radiation
is
capable
of
inducing
the
requisite
CML
-associated
t(9:22
)

translocation
(
Philadelphia
chromosome
)
in
appropriate
cells
in
vitro
but
,
thus
far
,
chemicals
have
not
shown
this
capacity
.

We
have
proposed
that
1,3-butadiene

metabolites
be
so
tested
as
a
reality
check
on
the
epidemiological
reports
.

In
order
to
conduct
reliable
testing
in
this
regard
,
it
is
essential
that
a
positive
control
for
induction
be
available
.

We
have
used
ionizing
radiation
to
develop
such
a
control
.

Results
described
here
demonstrate
that
this
agent
does
in
fact
induce
pathogenic
t(9:22
)

translocations
in
a
human
myeloid
cell
line
in
vitro
,
but
does
so
at
low
frequencies
.

Conditions
that
will
be
required
for
studies
of
1,3-butadiene
are

Cancer
incidence
and
metolachlor
use
in
the
Agricultural
Health
Study
:
An
update
.

UNASSIGNED
:

Metolachlor
,
a
widely
used
herbicide
,
is
classified
as
a
Group
C
carcinogen
by
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
based
on
increased
liver
neoplasms
in
female
rats
.

Epidemiologic
studies
of
the
health
effects
of
metolachlor
have
been
limited
.

The
Agricultural
Health
Study
(
AHS
)
is
a
prospective
cohort
study
including
licensed
private
and
commercial
pesticide
applicators
in
Iowa
and
North
Carolina
enrolled
1993
-
1997
.

We
evaluated
cancer
incidence
through
2010/2011
(
NC
/
IA
)
for
49,616
applicators
,
53
%
of
whom
reported
ever
using
metolachlor
.

We
used
Poisson
regression
to
evaluate
relations
between
two
metrics
of
metolachlor
use
(
lifetime
days
,
intensity
-
weighted
lifetime
days
)
and
cancer
incidence
.

We
saw
no
association
between
metolachlor
use
and
incidence
of
all
cancers
combined
(
n
=
5,701
with
a
5-year
lag
)
or
most
site
-
specific
cancers
.

For
liver
cancer
,
in
analyses
restricted
to
exposed
workers
,
elevations
observed
at
higher
categories
of
use
were
not
statistically
significant
.

However
,
trends
for
both
lifetime
and
intensity
-
weighted
lifetime
days
of
metolachor
use
were
positive
and
statistically
significant
with
an
unexposed
reference
group
.

A
similar
pattern
was
observed
for
follicular
cell
lymphoma
,
but
no
other
lymphoma
subtypes
.

An
earlier
suggestion
of
increased
lung
cancer
risk
at
high
levels
of
metolachlor
use
in
this
cohort
was
not
confirmed
in
this
update
.

This
suggestion
of
an
association
between
metolachlor
and
liver
cancer
among
pesticide
applicators
is
a
novel
finding
and
echoes
observation
of
increased
liver
neoplasms
in
some
animal
studies
.

However
,
our
findings
for
both
liver
cancer
and
follicular
cell
lymphoma
warrant
follow
-
up
to
better
differentiate
effects
of
metolachlor
use
from
other
factors
.

Mechanisms
Underlying
Latent
Disease
Risk
Associated
with
Early
-
Life

Arsenic
Exposure
:
Current
Research
Trends
and
Scientific
Gaps
.

BACKGROUND
:

Millions
of
individuals
worldwide
,
particularly
those
living
in
rural
and
developing
areas
,
are
exposed
to
harmful
levels
of
inorganic
arsenic

(
iAs
)
in
their
drinking
water
.

Inorganic
As
exposure
during
key
developmental
periods
is
associated
with
a
variety
of
adverse
health
effects
including
those
that
are
evident
in
adulthood
.

There
is
considerable
interest
in
identifying
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
relate
early
-
life
iAs
exposure
to
the
development
of
these
latent
diseases
,
particularly
in
relationship
to
cancer
.

OBJECTIVES
:

This
work
summarizes
research
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
underlie
the
increased
risk
of
cancer
development
in
adulthood
that
is
associated
with
early
-
life
iAs
exposure
.

DISCUSSION
:

Epigenetic
reprogramming
that
imparts
functional
changes
in
gene
expression
,
the
development
of
cancer
stem
cells
,
and
immunomodulation
are
plausible
underlying
mechanisms
by
which
early
-
life
iAs
exposure
elicits
latent
carcinogenic
effects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Evidence
is
mounting
that
relates
early
-
life
iAs
exposure
and
cancer
development
later
in
life
.

Future
research
should
include
animal
studies
that
address
mechanistic
hypotheses
and
studies
of
human
populations
that
integrate
early
-
life
exposure
,
molecular
alterations
,
and
latent
disease
outcomes
.

On
the
antiarrhythmic
activity
of
one
N
-
substituted
piperazine
derivative
of
trans-2-amino-3-hydroxy-1
,
2
,
3
,
4-tetrahydroanaphthalene
.

The
antiarrhythmic
activity
of
the
compound
N-(trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)-N-(3-oxo-3-phenyl-2-methylpropyl)-piperazine
hydrochloride
,
referred
to
as
P11
,
is
studied
on
anaesthesized
cats
and
Wistar
albino
rats
,
as
well
as
on
non
-
anaesthesized
rabbits
.

Four
types
of
experimental
arrhythmia
are
used
--
with
BaCl2
,
with
chloroform
-
adrenaline
,
with
strophantine
G
and
with
aconitine
.

The
compound
P11
is
introduced
in
doses
of
0.25
and
0.50
mg
/
kg
intravenously
and
10
mg
/
kg

orally
.

The
compound
manifests
antiarrhythmic
activity
in
all
models
of
experimental
arrhythmia
used
,
causing
greatest
inhibition
on
the
arrhythmia
induced
by
chloroform
-
adrenaline

(
in
90
per
cent
)
and
with
BaCl2
(
in
84
per
cent
)
.

The
results
obtained
are
associated
with
the
beta
-
adrenoblocking
and
with
the
membrane
-
stabilizing
action
of
the
compound
.

Experimental
progressive
muscular
dystrophy
and
its
treatment
with
high
doses
anabolizing
agents
.

We
are
still
a
long
way
from
discovering
an
unequivocal
pathogenetic
interpretation
of
progressive
muscular
dystrophy
in
man
.

Noteworthy
efforts
have
been
made
in
the
experimental
field
;
a
recessive
autosomic
form
found
in
the
mouse
seems
to
bear
the
closest
resemblance
to
the
human
form
from
the
genetic
point
of
view
.

Myopathy
due
to
lack
of
vitamin
E
and
myopathy
induced
by
certain
viruses
have
much
in
common
anatomically
and
pathologically
with
the
human
form
.

The
authors
induced
myodystrophy
in
the
rat
by
giving
it
a
diet
lacking
in
vitamin
E
.

The
pharmacological
characteristics
of
vitamin
E
and
the
degenerative
changes
brought
about
by
its
deficiency
,
especially
in
the
muscles
,
are
illustrated
.

It
is
thus
confirmed
that
the
histological
characteristics
of
myopathic
rat
muscle
induced
experimentally
are
extraordinarily
similar
to
those
of
human
myopathy
as
confirmed
during
biopsies
performed
at
the
Orthopaedic
Traumatological
Centre
,
Florence
.

The
encouraging
results
obtained
in
various
authoratative
departments
in
myopathic
patients
by
using
anabolizing
steroids
have
encouraged
the
authors
to
investigate
the
beneficial
effects
of
one
anabolizing
agent
(
Dianabol
,
CIBA
)
at
high
doses
in
rats
rendered
myopathic
by
a
diet
deficient
in
vitamin
E
.

In
this
way
they
obtained
appreciable
changes
in
body
weight
(
increased
from
50
to
70
g
after
forty
days
at
a
dose
of
5
mg
per
day
of
anabolizing
agent
)
,
but
most
of
all
they
found
histological
changes
due
to
"
regenerative
"
changes
in
the
muscle
tissue
,
which
however
maintained
its
myopathic
characteristics
in
the
control
animals
that
were
not
treated
with
the
anabolizing
agent
.

The
authors
conclude
by
affirming
the
undoubted
efficacy
of
the
anabolizing
steroids
in
experimental
myopathic
disease
,
but
they
have
reservations
as
to
the
transfer
of
the
results
into
the
human
field
,
where
high
dosage
can
not
be
carried
out
continuously
because
of
the
effects
of
the
drug
on
virility
;
because
the
tissue
injury
too
often
occurs
at
an
irreversible
stage
vis
-
a
-
vis
the
"
regeneration
"
of
the
muscle
tissue
;
and
finally
because
the
dystrophic
injurious
agent
is
certainly
not
the
lack
of
vitamin
E
but
something
as
yet
unknown
.

Fetal
risks
due
to
warfarin
therapy
during
pregnancy
.

Two
mothers
with
heart
valve
prosthesis
were
treated
with
warfarin
during
pregnancy
.

In
the
first
case
a
caesarean
section
was
done
one
week
after
replacement
of
warfarin
with
heparin
.

The
baby
died
of
cerebral
and
pulmonary
hemorrhage
.

The
second
mother
had
a
male
infant
by
caesarean
section
.

The
baby
showed
warfarin

-induced

embryopathy
with
nasal
hypoplasia
and
stippled
epiphyses

(
chondrodysplasia
punctata
)
.

Nasal
hypoplasia
with
or
without
stippled
epiphyses
has
now
been
reported
in
11
infants
born
to
mothers
treated
with
warfarin
during
the
first
trimester
,
and
a
causal
association
is
probable
.

In
view
of
the
risks
to
both
mother
and
fetus
in
women
with
prosthetic
cardiac
valves
it
is
recommended
that
therapeutic
abortion
be
advised
as
the
first
alternative
.

and
these
were
not

Tachyphylaxis

Increased
anxiogenic
effects
of
caffeine
in
panic
disorders
.

The
effects
of
oral
administration
of
caffeine

(
10
mg
/
kg
)
on
behavioral
ratings
,
somatic
symptoms
,
blood
pressure
and
plasma
levels
of
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol

(
MHPG
)
and
cortisol
were
determined
in
17
healthy
subjects
and
21
patients
meeting
DSM
-
III
criteria
for
agoraphobia
with
panic
attacks
or
panic
disorder
.

Caffeine
produced
significantly
greater
increases
in
subject
-
rated
anxiety
,
nervousness
,
fear
,
nausea
,
palpitations
,
restlessness
,
and
tremors
in
the
patients
compared
with
healthy
subjects
.

In
the
patients
,
but
not
the
healthy
subjects
,
these
symptoms
were
significantly
correlated
with
plasma
caffeine
levels
.

Seventy
-
one
percent
of
the
patients
reported
that
the
behavioral
effects
of
caffeine
were
similar
to
those
experienced
during
panic
attacks
.

Caffeine
did
not
alter
plasma
MHPG
levels
in
either
the
healthy
subjects
or
patients
.

Caffeine
increased
plasma
cortisol
levels
equally
in
the
patient
and
healthy
groups
.

Because
caffeine
is
an
adenosine
receptor
antagonist
,
these
results
suggest
that
some
panic
disorder
patients
may
have
abnormalities
in
neuronal
systems
involving
adenosine
.

Patients
with
anxiety
disorders
may
benefit
by
avoiding
caffeine

foods
and
beverages

Interstrain
variation
in
acute
toxic
response
to
caffeine
among
inbred
mice
.

Acute
toxic
dosage
-
dependent
behavioral
effects
of
caffeine
were
compared
in
adult
males
from
seven
inbred
mouse
strains
(

.

C57BL/6J
,
chosen
as
a
"
prototypic
"
mouse
strain
,
was
used
to
determine
behavioral
responses
to
a
broad
range
(
5
-
500
mg
/
kg
)
of
caffeine
doses
.

Five
phenotypic
characteristics
--
locomotor
activity
,
righting
ability
,
clonic
seizure
induction
,
stress
-
induced
lethality
,
death
without
external
stress
--
were
scored
at
various
caffeine
doses
in
drug
-
naive
animals
under
empirically
optimized
,
rigidly
constant
experimental
conditions
.

Mice
(
n
=
12
for
each
point
)
received
single
IP
injections
of
a
fixed
volume
/
g
body
weight
of
physiological
saline
carrier
with
or
without
caffeine
in
doses
ranging
from
125
-
500
mg
/
kg
.

Loss
of
righting
ability
was
scored
at
1
,
3
,
5
min
post
dosing
and
at
5
min
intervals
thereafter
for
20
min
.

In
the
same
animals
the
occurrence
of
clonic
seizures
was
scored
as
to
time
of
onset
and
severity
for
20
min
after
drug
administration
.

When
these
proceeded
to
tonic
seizures
,
death
occurred
in
less
than
20
min
.

Animals
surviving
for
20
min
were
immediately
stressed
by
a
swim
test
in
25
degrees
C
water
,
and
death
-
producing
tonic
seizures
were
scored
for
2
min
.

In
other
animals
locomotor
activity
was
measured
15
or
60
min
after
caffeine
administration
.

By
any
single
behavioral
criterion
or
a
combination
of
these
criteria
,
marked
differences
in
response
to
toxic
caffeine
doses
were
observed
between
strains
.

These
results
indicate
that
behavioral
toxicity
testing
of
alkylxanthines
in
a
single
mouse
strain
may
be
misleading
and
suggest
that
toxic
responses
of
the
central
nervous
system
to
this
class
of
compounds
are
genetically
influenced
in
mammals
.

Invasive
carcinoma
of
the
renal
pelvis
following
cyclophosphamide
therapy
for
nonmalignant
disease
.

A
47-year
-
old
woman
with
right
hydroureteronephrosis
due
to
ureterovesical
junction
obstruction
had
gross
hematuria
after
being
treated
for
five
years
wtih
cyclophosphamide
for
cerebral
vasculitis
.

A
right
nephroureterectomy
was
required
for
control
of
bleeding
.

The
pathology
specimen
contained
clinically
occult
invasive
carcinoma
of
the
renal
pelvis
.

Although
the
ability
of
cyclophosphamide
to
cause
hemorrhagic
cystitis
and
urine
cytologic
abnormalities
indistinguishable
from
high
grade

carcinoma
is
well
known
,
it
is
less
widely
appreciated
that
it
is
also
associated
with
carcinoma
of
the
urinary
tract
.

Twenty
carcinomas
of
the
urinary
bladder
and
one
carcinoma
of
the
prostate
have
been
reported
in
association
with
its
use
.

The
present
case
is
the
first
carcinoma
of
the
renal
pelvis
reported
in
association
with
cyclophosphamide
treatment
.

It
is
the
third
urinary
tract
cancer
reported
in
association
with
cyclophosphamide
treatment
for
nonmalignant
disease
.

The
association
of
the
tumor
with
preexisting
hydroureteronephrosis
suggests
that
stasis
prolonged
and
intensified
exposure
of
upper
urinary
tract
epithelium
to
cyclophosphamide
.

Patients
who
are
candidates
for
long
-
term
cyclophosphamide
treatment
should
be
routinely
evaluated
for
obstructive
uropathy
.

Ascending
dose
tolerance
study
of
intramuscular
carbetocin
administered
after
normal
vaginal
birth
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
determine
the
maximum
tolerated
dose
(
MTD
)
of
carbetocin

(
a
long
-
acting
synthetic
analogue
of
oxytocin
)
,
when
administered
immediately
after
vaginal
delivery
at
term
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

Carbetocin
was
given
as
an
intramuscular
injection
immediately
after
the
birth
of
the
infant
in
45
healthy
women
with
normal
singleton
pregnancies
who
delivered
vaginally
at
term
.

Dosage
groups
of
15
,
30

,
75
,
100
,
125
,
150

microg

carbetocin
were
assigned
to
blocks
of
three
women
according
to
the
continual
reassessment
method
(
CRM
)
.

RESULTS
:

All
dosage
groups
consisted
of
three
women
,
except
those
with
100
microg
(
n=6
)
and
200
microg
(
n=18
)
.

Recorded
were
dose
-
limiting
adverse
events
:

hyper-
or
hypotension
(
three
)
,
severe
abdominal
pain
(
0
)
,
vomiting
(
0
)
and
retained
placenta
(
four
)
.

Serious
adverse
events
occurred
in
seven
women
:
six
cases
with
blood
loss

>
or
=
1000
ml
,
four
cases
of
manual
placenta
removal
,
five
cases
of
additional
oxytocics
administration
and
five
cases
of
blood
transfusion
.

Maximum
blood
loss
was
greatest
at
the
upper
and
lower
dose
levels
,
and
lowest
in
the
70
-
125
microg
dose
range
.

Four
out
of
six
cases
with
blood
loss

>
or
=
1000
ml
occurred
in
the
200
microg
group
.

The
majority
of
additional
administration
of
oxytocics
(
4/5
)
and
blood
transfusion
(
3/5
)
occurred
in
the
dose
groups
of
200
microg
.

All
retained
placentae
were
found
in
the
group
of
200
microg
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
MTD
was
calculated
to
be
at
200

A
pilot
study
to
assess
the
safety
of

dobutamine
stress
echocardiography
in
the
emergency
department
evaluation
of
cocaine
-associated
chest
pain
.

STUDY
OBJECTIVE
:

Chest
pain
in
the
setting
of
cocaine
use
poses
a
diagnostic
dilemma
.

Dobutamine
stress
echocardiography
(
DSE
)
is
a
widely
available
and
sensitive
test
for
evaluating
cardiac
ischemia
.

Because
of
the
theoretical
concern
regarding
administration
of
dobutamine
in
the
setting
of
cocaine
use
,
we
conducted
a
pilot
study
to
assess
the
safety
of
DSE
in
emergency
department
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

chest
pain
.

METHODS
:

A
prospective
case
series
was
conducted
in
the
intensive
diagnostic
and
treatment
unit
in
the
ED
of
an
urban
tertiary
-
care
teaching
hospital
.

Patients
were
eligible
for
DSE
if
they
had
used
cocaine
within
24
hours
preceding
the
onset
of
chest
pain
and
had
a
normal
ECG
and
tropinin

I
level
.

Patients
exhibiting
signs
of
continuing
cocaine
toxicity
were
excluded
from
the
study
.

All
patients
were
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
serial
testing
after
the
DSE
testing
in
the
intensive
diagnostic
and
treatment
unit
.

RESULTS
:

Twenty
-
four
patients
were
enrolled
.

Two
patients
had
inadequate
resting
images
,
one
DSE
was
terminated
because
of
inferior
hypokinesis
,
another
DSE
was
terminated
because
of
a
rate
-
related
atrial
conduction
deficit
,
and
1
patient
did
not
reach
the
target
heart
rate
.

Thus
,
19
patients
completed
a
DSE
and
reached
their
target
heart
rates
.

None
of
the
patients
experienced
signs
of
exaggerated
adrenergic
response
,
which
was
defined
as
a
systolic
blood
pressure
of
greater
than
200
mm
Hg
or
the
occurrence
of
tachydysrhythmias
(
excluding
sinus
tachycardia
)
.

Further
suggesting
lack
of
exaggerated
adrenergic
response
,
13
(
65
%
)
of
20
patients
required
supplemental
atropine
to
reach
their
target
heart
rates
.

CONCLUSION
:

No
exaggerated
adrenergic
response
was
detected
when
dobutamine
was
administered
to
patients
with
cocaine

-related

chest
pain
.

Amiodarone
-induced
torsade
de
pointes
during
bladder
irrigation
:
an
unusual
presentation
--
a
case
report
.

The
authors
present
a
case
of
early
(
within
4
days
)
development
of
torsade
de
pointes

(
TdP
)
associated
with
oral
amiodarone
therapy
.

Consistent
with
other
reports
this
case
of
TdP
occurred
in
the
context
of
multiple
exacerbating
factors
including
hypokalemia
and
digoxin
excess
.

Transient
prolongation
of
the
QT
during
bladder
irrigation
prompted
the
episode
of
TdP
.

It
is
well
known
that
bradycardia
exacerbates
acquired
TdP
.

The
authors
speculate
that
the
increased
vagal
tone
during
bladder
irrigation
,
a
vagal
maneuver
,
in
the
context
of
amiodarone
therapy
resulted
in
amiodarone
-induced
proarrhythmia
.

In
the
absence
of
amiodarone
therapy
,
a
second
bladder
irrigation
did
not
induce
TdP
despite
hypokalemia
and
hypomagnesemia
.

Acute
renal
insufficiency
after
high
-
dose
melphalan
in
patients
with
primary
systemic
amyloidosis
during
stem
cell
transplantation
.

BACKGROUND
:

Patients
with
primary
systemic
amyloidosis

(
AL
)
have
a
poor
prognosis
.

Median
survival
time
from
standard
treatments
is
only
17
months
.

High
-
dose
intravenous
melphalan
followed
by
peripheral
blood
stem
cell
transplant
(
PBSCT
)
appears
to
be
the
most
promising
therapy
,
but
treatment
mortality
can
be
high
.

The
authors
have
noted
the
development
of
acute
renal
insufficiency
immediately
after
melphalan
conditioning
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
further
examine
its
risk
factors
and
impact
on
posttransplant
mortality
.

METHODS
:
Consecutive
AL
patients
who
underwent
PBSCT
were
studied
retrospectively
.

Acute
renal
insufficiency

(
ARI
)
after
high
-
dose
melphalan
was
defined
by
a
minimum
increase
of
0.5
mg
/
dL
(
44
micromol
/
L
)
in
the
serum
creatinine
level
that
is
greater
than
50
%
of
baseline
immediately
after
conditioning
.

Urine
sediment
score
was
the
sum
of
the
individual
types
of
sediment
identified
on
urine
microscopy
.

RESULTS
:

Of
the
80
patients
studied
,
ARI
developed
in
18.8
%
of
the
patients
after
high
-
dose
melphalan
.

Univariate
analysis
identified
age
,
hypoalbuminemia
,
heavy
proteinuria
,
diuretic
use
,
and
urine
sediment
score
(
>
3
)
as
risk
factors
.

Age
and
urine
sediment
score
remained
independently
significant
risk
factors
in
the
multivariate
analysis
.

Patients
who
had
ARI
after
high
-
dose
melphalan
underwent
dialysis
more
often
(
P
=
0.007
)
,
and
had
a
worse
1-year
survival
(
P
=
0.03
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
timing
of
renal
injury
strongly
suggests
melphalan
as
the
causative
agent
.

Ongoing

tubular
injury
may
be
a
prerequisite
for
renal
injury
by
melphalan
as
evidenced
by
the
active
urinary
sediment
.

Development
of
ARI
adversely
affected
the
outcome
after
PBSCT
.

Effective
preventive
measures
may
help
decrease
the
treatment
mortality
of
PBSCT
in
AL
patients
.

Impaired
fear
recognition
in
regular
recreational
cocaine
users
.

INTRODUCTION
:

The
ability
to
read
facial
expressions
is
essential
for
normal
human
social
interaction
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
conduct
the
first
investigation
of
facial
expression
recognition
performance
in
recreational
cocaine
users
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:

Three
groups
,
comprised
of
21
cocaine
naive
participants
(
CN
)
,
30
occasional
cocaine

(
OC
)
,
and
48
regular
recreational
cocaine

(
RC
)
users
,
were
compared
.

An
emotional
facial
expression
(
EFE
)
task
consisting
of
a
male
and
female
face
expressing
six
basic
emotions
(
happiness
,
surprise
,
sadness
,
anger
,
fear
,
and
disgust
)
was
administered
.

Mean
percent
accuracy
and
latencies
for
correct
responses
across
eight
presentations
of
each
basic
emotion
were
derived
.

Participants
were
also
assessed
with
the
"
Eyes
task
"
to
investigate
their
ability
to
recognize
more
complex
emotional
states
and
the
Symptom
CheckList-90-Revised
to
measure
psychopathology
.

RESULTS
:

There
were
no
group
differences
in
psychopathology
or
"
eyes
task
"
performance
,
but
the
RC
group
,
who
otherwise
had
similar
illicit
substance
use
histories
to
the
OC
group
,
exhibited
impaired
fear
recognition
accuracy
compared
to
the
OC
and
CN
groups
.

The
RC
group
also
correctly
identified
anger
,
fear
,
happiness
,
and
surprise
,
more
slowly
than
CN
,
but
not
OC
participants
.

The
OC
group
was
slower
than
CN
when
correctly
identifying
disgust
.

The
selective
deficit
in
fear
recognition
accuracy
manifested
by
the
RC
group
can
not
be
explained
by
the
subacute
effects
of
cocaine
,
or
ecstasy
,
because
recent
and
less
recent
users
of
these
drugs
within
this
group
were
similarly
impaired
.

Possible
parallels
between
RC
users
and
psychopaths
with
respect
to
impaired
fear
recognition
,
amygdala
dysfunction
,
and
etiology
are
discussed
.

Corneal
ulcers
associated
with
aerosolized
crack
cocaine
use
.

PURPOSE
:

We
report
4
cases
of
corneal
ulcers
associated
with
drug
abuse
.

The
pathogenesis
of
these
ulcers
and
management
of
these
patients
are
also
reviewed
.

METHODS
:
Review
of
all
cases
of
corneal
ulcers
associated
with
drug
abuse

seen
at
our
institution
from
July
2006
to
December
2006
.

RESULTS
:

Four
patients
with
corneal
ulcers
associated
with
crack
cocaine
use
were
reviewed
.

All
corneal
ulcers
were
cultured
,
and
the
patients
were
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
intensive
topical
antibiotic
treatment
.

Each
patient
received
comprehensive
health
care
,
including
medical
and
substance
abuse
consultations
.

Streptococcal
organisms
were
found
in
3
cases
and
Capnocytophaga
and
Brevibacterium
casei
in
1
patient
.

The
infections
responded
to
antibiotic
treatment
.

Two
patients
needed
a
lateral
tarsorrhaphy
for
persistent
epithelial
defects
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Aerosolized
crack
cocaine
use
can
be
associated
with
the
development
of
corneal
ulcers
.

Drug
abuse
provides
additional
challenges
for
management
.

Not
only
treatment
of
their
infections
but
also
the
overall
poor
health
of
the
patients
and
increased
risk
of
noncompliance
need
to
be
addressed
.

Comprehensive
care
may
provide
the
patient
the
opportunity
to
discontinue
their
substance
abuse
,
improve
their
overall
health
,
and
prevent
future
corneal
complications
.

,
and
tolerability
of
oral
levetiracetam
administered
as
an
adjunct
to
phenobarbital
treatment
in
cats

with
phenobarbital
or
that
had
unacceptable
adverse
effects
when
treated
with

prior
to
treatment
with
levetiracetam
(
2.1
seizures
/mo
)
was
significantly
higher
than
median
seizure
frequency
after
initiation
of
levetiracetam
treatment
(
0.42
seizures
/mo
)
,
and
7
of
10
cats
were
classified
as
having
responded
to
levetiracetam
treatment
(
ie
,
reduction
in
seizure
frequency
of
>
or=50
%
)
.

Two
cats
had
transient

lethargy
and
inappetence
.

CONCLUSIONS
AND
CLINICAL
RELEVANCE
:

Results
suggested
that
levetiracetam
is
well
tolerated
in
cats
and
may
be
useful
as
an
adjunct
to
phenobarbital
treatment
in
cats
with
idiopathic
epilepsy
.

Bilateral
haemorrhagic
infarction
of
the
globus
pallidus
after
cocaine
and
alcohol
intoxication
.

Cocaine
is
a
risk
factor
for
both
ischemic
and
haemorrhagic
stroke
.

We
present
the
case
of
a
31-year
-
old
man
with
bilateral
ischemia
of
the
globus
pallidus
after
excessive
alcohol
and
intranasal
cocaine
use
.

Drug
-
related

globus
pallidus
infarctions
are
most
often
associated
with
heroin
.

Bilateral
basal
ganglia
infarcts
after
the
use
of
cocaine
,
without
concurrent
heroin
use
,
have
never
been
reported
.

In
our
patient
,
transient
cardiac
arrhythmia
or
respiratory
dysfunction
related
to
cocaine
and/or
ethanol
use
were
the
most
likely
causes
of
cerebral
hypoperfusion
.

Acute
renal
failure
after
high
-
dose
methotrexate
therapy
in
a
patient
with
ileostomy
.

High
-
dose
methotrexate

(
HD-
MTX
)
is
an
important
treatment
for
Burkitt
lymphoma
,
but
can
cause
hepatic
and
renal
toxicity
when
its
clearance
is
delayed
.

We
report
a
case
of
acute
renal
failure

after
HD-
MTX
therapy
in
a
patient
with
ileostomy
,
The
patient
was
a
3-year
-
old
boy
who
had
received
a
living
-
related
liver
transplantation
for
congenital
biliary
atresia
.

At
day
833
after
the
transplantation
,
he
was
diagnosed
with
PTLD

(
post
-
transplantation
lymphoproliferative
disorder
,
Burkitt
-
type
malignant
lymphoma
)
.

During
induction
therapy
,
he
suffered
ileal
perforation
and
ileostomy
was
performed
.

Subsequent
HD-
MTX
therapy
caused
acute
renal
failure
that
required
continuous
hemodialysis
.

We
supposed
that
intravascular
hypovolemia
due
to
substantial
drainage
from
the
ileostoma
caused
acute
prerenal
failure
.

After
recovery
of
his
renal
function
,
we
could
safely
treat
the
patient
with
HD-
MTX
therapy
by
controlling
drainage
from
ileostoma
with
total
parenteral
nutrition
.

Antithrombotic
drug
use
,
cerebral
microbleeds
,
and
intracerebral
hemorrhage
:
a
systematic
review
of
published
and
unpublished
studies
.

BACKGROUND
AND
PURPOSE
:

Cerebral
microbleeds

(
MB
)
are
potential
risk
factors
for
intracerebral
hemorrhage

(
ICH
)
,
but
it
is
unclear
if
they
are
a
contraindication
to
using
antithrombotic
drugs
.

Insights
could
be
gained
by
pooling
data
on
MB
frequency
stratified
by
antithrombotic
use
in
cohorts
with
ICH
and
ischemic
stroke

(
IS
)
/

transient
ischemic
attack

(
TIA
)
.

METHODS
:
We
performed
a
systematic
review
of
published
and
unpublished
data
from
cohorts
with
stroke
or
TIA
to
compare
the
presence
of
MB
in
:
(
1
)
antithrombotic
users
vs
nonantithrombotic
users
with
ICH
;
(
2
)
antithrombotic
users
vs
nonusers
with
IS
/
TIA
;
and
(
3
)
ICH
vs
ischemic
events
stratified
by
antithrombotic
use
.

We
also
analyzed
published
and
unpublished
follow
-
up
data
to
determine
the
risk
of
ICH
in
antithrombotic
users
with
MB
.

RESULTS
:

In
a
pooled
analysis
of
1460
ICH
and
3817

IS
/
TIA
,

MB
were
more
frequent
in
ICH
vs
IS
/
TIA
in
all
treatment
groups
,
but
the
excess
increased
from
2.8
(
odds
ratio
;
range
,
2.3
-
3.5
)
in
nonantithrombotic
users
to
5.7
(
range
,
3.4
-
9.7
)
in
antiplatelet
users
and
8.0
(
range
,
3.5
-
17.8
)
in
warfarin
users
(
P
difference=0.01
)
.

There
was
also
an
excess
of
MB
in
warfarin
users
vs
nonusers
with
ICH

(
OR
,
2.7
;
95
%
CI
,
1.6
-
4.4
;
P<0.001
)
but
none
in
warfarin
users
with
IS
/
TIA

(
OR
,
1.3
;
95
%
CI
,
0.9
-
1.7
;
P=0.33
;
P
difference=0.01
)
.

There
was
a
smaller
excess
of
MB
in
antiplatelet
users
vs
nonusers
with
ICH

(
OR
,
1.7
;
95
%
CI
,
1.3
-
2.3
;
P<0.001
)
,
but

findings
were
similar
for
antiplatelet
users
with
IS
/
TIA

(
OR
,
1.4
;
95
%
CI
,
1.2
-
1.7
;
P<0.001
;
P
difference=0.25
)
.

In
pooled
follow
-
up
data
for
768
antithrombotic
users
,
presence
of
MB
at
baseline
was
associated
with
a
substantially
increased
risk
of
subsequent
ICH

(
OR
,
12.1
;
95
%
CI
,
3.4
-
42.5
;
P<0.001
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
excess
of
MB
in
warfarin
users
with
ICH
compared
to
other
groups
suggests
that
MB
increase
the
risk
of
warfarin

-associated

ICH
.

Limited
prospective
data
corroborate
these
findings
,
but
larger
prospective
studies
are
urgently
required
.

Verapamil
stimulation
test
in
hyperprolactinemia
:
loss
of
prolactin
response
in
anatomic
or
functional
stalk
effect
.

AIM
:
Verapamil
stimulation
test
was
previously
investigated
as
a
tool
for
differential
diagnosis
of
hyperprolactinemia
,
but
with
conflicting
results
.

Macroprolactinemia
was
never
considered
in
those
previous
studies
.

Here
,
we
aimed
to
re
-
investigate
the
diagnostic
value
of
verapamil
in
a
population
who
were
all
screened
for
macroprolactinemia
.

Prolactin
responses
to
verapamil
in
65
female
patients
(
age
:
29.9
+
/-

8.1
years
)
with
hyperprolactinemia
were
tested
in
a
descriptive
,
matched
case
-
control
study
.

METHODS
:
Verapamil

80
mg
,
p.o
.

was
administered
,
and
then
PRL
levels
were
measured
at
8th
and
16th
hours
,
by
immunometric
chemiluminescence
.

Verapamil
responsiveness
was
determined
by
peak
percent
change
in
basal
prolactin
levels
(
PRL
)
.

RESULTS
:

Verapamil
significantly
increased
PRL
levels
in
healthy
controls
(
N.
8
,
PRL
:
183
%
)
,
macroprolactinoma

(
N.
8
,
PRL
:
7
%
)
,
microprolactinoma

(
N.
19
,
PRL
:
21
%
)
,
macroprolactinemia

(
N.
23
,
PRL
:
126
%
)
,
but
not
in
pseudoprolactinoma

(
N.
8
,
PRL
:
0.8
%
)
,
and
risperidone
-induced
hyperprolactinemia
(
N.
7
,
PRL
:
3
%
)
.

ROC
curve
analysis
revealed
that
unresponsiveness
to
verapamil
defined
as
PRL
7
%
,
discriminated
anatomical
or
functional
stalk
effect
(
sensitivity
:
74
%
,
specificity
:
73
%
,
AUC
:
0.855+/-0.04
,
P
0.001
,
CI
:
0.768
-
0.942
)
associated
with
pseudoprolactinoma
or
risperidone

-induced

hyperprolactinemia
,
respectively
.

CONCLUSION
:

Verapamil
responsiveness
is
not
a
reliable
finding
for
the
differential
diagnosis
of
hyperprolactinemia
.

However
,
verapamil
unresponsiveness
discriminates
stalk
effect
(
i.e.
,
anatomically
or
functionally
inhibited
dopaminergic
tonus
)
from
other
causes
of
hyperprolactinemia
with
varying
degrees
of
responsiveness
.

Central
action
of
narcotic
analgesics
.

Part
IV
.

Noradrenergic
influences
on
the
activity
of
analgesics
in
rats
.

The
effect
of
clonidine
,
naphazoline
and
xylometazoline
on
analgesia
induced
by
morphine
,
codeine
,
fentanyl
and
pentazocine
,
and
on
cataleptic
effect
of
morphine
,
codine
and
fentanyl
was
studied
in
rats
.

The
biochemical
assays
on
the
influence
of
four
analgesics
on
the
brain
concentration
and
turnover
of
noradrenaline

(
NA
)
were
also
performed
.

It
was
found
that
three
drugs
stimulating
central
NA
receptors
failed
to
affect
the
analgesic
ED50
of
all
antinociceptive
agents
and
they
enhanced
catalepsy
induced
by
morphine
and
fentanyl
.

Codeine

catalepsy
was
increased
by
clonidine
and
decreased
by
naphazoline
and
xylometazoline
.

The
brain
concentration
of
NA
was
not
changed
by
morphine
and
fentanyl
,
but
one
of
the
doses
of
codeine

(
45
mg
/
kg
)
slightly
enhanced
it
.

Pentazocine

dose
-
dependently
decreased
the
brain
level
of
NA
.

The
rate
of
NA
turnover
was
not
altered
by
analgesics
except
for
the
higher
dose
of
fentanyl

(
0.2
mg
/
kg
)
following
which
the
disappearance
of
NA
from
the
brain
was
diminished
.

The
results
are
discussed
in
the
light
of
various
and
non
-
uniform
data
from
the
literature
.

It
is
suggested
that
in
rats
the
brain

NA
plays
a
less
important
function
than
the
other
monoamines
in
the
behavioural
activity
of
potent
analgesics
.

Modification
by
propranolol
of
cardiovascular
effects
of
induced
hypoglycaemia
.

The
cardiovascular
effects
of
hypoglycaemia
,
with
and
without
beta
-
blockade
,
were
compared
in
fourteen
healthy
men
.

Eight
received
insulin
alone
,
and
eight
,
including
two
of
the
original
insulin
-
only
group
,
were
given
propranolol
and
insulin
.

In
the
insulin
-
group
the
period
of
hypoglycaemia
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
heart
-
rate
and
a
fall
in
diastolic
blood
-
pressure
.

In
the
propranolol
-insulin
group
there
was
a
significant
fall
in
heart
-
rate
in
most
subjects
and
an
increase
in
diastolic
pressure
.

Typical
S
-
T
/
T
changes
occurred
in
the
insulin
-
group
but
in
none
of
the
propranolol
-insulin
group
.

Hypertension
in
diabetics
prone
to
hypoglycaemia
attacks
should
not
be
treated
with
beta
-
blockers
because
these
drugs
may
cause
a
sharp
rise
in
blood
-
pressure
in
such
patients
.

Prevention
and
treatment
of
endometrial
disease
in
climacteric
women
receiving
oestrogen
therapy
.

The
treatment
regimens
are
described
in
74
patients
with
endometrial
disease
among
850
climacteric
women
receiving
oestrogen
therapy
.

Cystic
hyperplasia
was
associated
with
unopposed
oestrogen
therapy
without
progestagen
.

Two
courses
of
21
days
of
5
mg
norethisterone
daily
caused
reversion
to
normal
in
all
57
cases
of
cystic
hyperplasia
and
6
of
the
8
cases
of
atypical
hyperplasia
.

4
cases
of
endometrial
carcinoma
referred
from
elsewhere
demonstrated
the
problems
of
inappropriate
and
unsupervised
unopposed

oestrogen
therapy
and
the
difficulty
in
distinguishing
severe
hyperplasia
from
malignancy
.

Cyclical
low
-
dose

oestrogen
therapy
with
7
-
-13
days
of
progestagen
does
not
seem
to
increase
the
risk
of
endometrial
hyperplasia
or
carcinoma
.

Pure
red
cell
aplasia
,
toxic
dermatitis
and
lymphadenopathy
in
a
patient
taking
diphenylhydantoin
.

A
patient
taking
diphenylhydantoin
for
3
weeks
developed
a
generalized
skin
rash
,
lymphadenopathy
and
pure
red
cell
aplasia
.

After
withdrawal
of
the
pharmacon
all
symptoms
disappeared
spontaneously
.

Skin
rash
is
a
well
-
known
complication
of
diphenylhydantoin
treatment
as
is
benign
and
malignant
lymphadenopathy
.

Pure
red
cell
aplasia
associated
with
diphenylhydantoin
medication
has
been
reported
in
3
patients
.

The
exact
mechanism
by
which
diphenylhydantoin
exerts
its
toxic
effects
is
not
known
.

In
this
patient
the
time
relation
between
the
ingestion
of
diphenylhydantoin
and
the
occurrence
of
the
skin
rash
,
lymphadenopathy
and
pure
red
cell
aplasia
is
very
suggestive
of
a
direct
connection
.

Continuous
infusion

tobramycin
combined
with
carbenicillin
for
infections
in
cancer
patients
.

The
cure
rate
of
infections
in
cancer

patients
is
adversely
affected
by
neutropenia

(
less
than
1,000/mm3
)
.

In
particular
,
patients
with
severe
neutropenia

(
less
than
100/mm3
)
have
shown
a
poor
response
to
antibiotics
.

To
overcome
the
adverse
effects
of
neutropenia
,
tobramycin
was
given
by
continuous
infusion
and
combined
with
intermittent
carbenicillin
.

Tobramycin
was
given
to
a
total
daily
dose
of
300
mg
/
m2
and
carbenicillin
was
given
at
a
dose
of
5
gm
every
four
hours
.

There
were
125
infectious
episodes
in
116
cancer
patients
receiving
myelosuppressive
chemotherapy
.

The
overall
cure
rate
was
70
%
.

Pneumonia
was
the
most
common
infection
and
61
%
of
59
episodes
were
cured
.

Gram
-
negative
bacilli
were
the
most
common
causative
organisms
and
69
%
of
these
infections
were
cured
.

The
most
common
pathogen
was
Klebsiella
pneumoniae
and
this
,
together
with
Escherichia
coli
and
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
,
accounted
for
74
%
of
all
gram
-
negative
bacillary
infections
.

Response
was
not
influenced
by
the
initial
neutrophil
count
,
with
a
62
%
cure
rate
for
39
episodes
associated
with
severe
neutropenia
.

However
,
failure
of
the
neutrophil
count
to
increase
during
therapy
adversely
affected
response
.

Azotemia
was
the
major
side
effect
recognized
,
and
it
occurred
in
11
%
of
episodes
.

Major
azotemia

(
serum

creatinine
greater
than
2.5
mg
/
dl
or
BUN
greater
than
50
mg
/
dl
)
occurred
in
only
2
%
.

Azotemia
was
not
related
to
duration
of
therapy
or
serum
tobramycin
concentration
.

This
antibiotic
regimen
showed
both
therapeutic
efficacy
and
acceptable
renal
toxicity
for
these
patients
.

Recurrent
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
associated
with
aminocaproic
acid
therapy
and
acute
renal
artery
thrombosis
.

Case
report
.

Epsilon
aminocaproic
acid

(
EACA
)
has
been
used
to
prevent
rebleeding
in
patients
with
subarachnoid
hemorrhage

(
SAH
)
.

Although
this
agent
does
decrease
the
frequency
of
rebleeding
,
several
reports
have
described
thrombotic
complications
of
EACA
therapy
.

These
complications
have
included
clinical
deterioration
and
intracranial
vascular
thrombosis
in
patients
with
SAH
,
arteriolar
and
capillary
fibrin
thrombi
in
patients
with
fibrinolytic
syndromes
treated
with
EACA
,
or
other
thromboembolic
phenomena
.

Since
intravascular
fibrin
thrombi
are
often
observed
in
patients
with
fibrinolytic
disorders
,
EACA
should
not
be
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
fibrin
thrombi
in
patients
with
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
or
other
"
consumption
coagulopathies
.

"

This
report
describes
subtotal
infarction
of
the
kidney
due
to
thrombosis
of
a
normal
renal
artery
.

This
occlusion
occurred
after
EACA
therapy
in
a
patient
with
SAH
and
histopathological
documentation
of
recurrent
SAH
.

The
corresponding
clinical
event
was
characterized
by
marked
hypertension
and
abrupt
neurological
deterioration
.

Long
-
term
propranolol
therapy
in
pregnancy
:
maternal
and
fetal
outcome
.

Propranolol
,
a
beta
-
adrenergic
blocking
agent
,
has
found
an
important
position
in
the
practice
of
medicine
.

Its
use
in
pregnancy
,
however
,
is
an
open
question
as
a
number
of
detrimental
side
effects
have
been
reported
in
the
fetus
and
neonate
.

Ten
patients
and
12
pregnancies
are
reported
where
chronic
propranolol
has
been
administered
.

Five
patients
with
serial
pregnancies
with
and
without

propranolol
therapy
are
also
examined
.

Maternal
,
fetal
,
and
neonatal
complications
are
examined
.

An
attempt
is
made
to
differentiate
drug
-
related
complications
from
maternal
disease
--
related
complications
.

We
conclude
that
previously
reported
hypoglycemia
,
hyperbilirubinemia
,
polycythemia
,
neonatal
apnea
,
and
bradycardia
are
not
invariable
and
can
not
be
statistically
correlated
with
chronic
propranolol
therapy
.

Growth
retardation
,
however
,
appears
to
be
significant
in
both
of
our
series
.

Use
of
propranolol
in
the
treatment
of
idiopathic
orthostatic
hypotension
.

Five
patients
with
idiopathic
orthostatic
hypotension
who
had
physiologic
and
biochemical
evidence
of
severe
autonomic
dysfunction
were
included
in
the
study
.

They
all
exhibited
markedly
reduced
plasma
catecholamines
and
plasma
renin
activity
in
both
recumbent
and
upright
positions
and
had
marked
hypersensitivity
to
the
pressor
effects
of
infused
norepinephrine
.

Treatment
with
propanolol

administered
intravenously
(
1
-
5
mg
)
produced
increases
in
supine
and
upright
blood
pressure
in
4
of
the
5
individuals
with
rises
ranging
from
11/6
to
22/11
mmHg
.

Chronic
oral
administration
of
propranolol

(
40
-
160
mg
/
day
)
also
elevated
the
blood
pressures
of
these
individuals
with
increases
in
the
order
of
20
-
35/15
-
25
mmg
being
observed
.

In
1
patient
,
marked
hypertension
was
induced
by
propranolol
and
the
drug
had
to
be
withdrawn
.

It
otherwise
was
well
tolerated
and
no
important
side
effects
were
observed
.

Treatment
has
been
continued
in
3
individuals
for
6
-
13
months
with
persistence
of
the
pressor
effect
,
although
there
appears
to
have
been
some
decrease
in
the
degree
of
response
with
time
.

Hemodynamic
measurements
in
1
of
the
patients
demonstrated
an
increase
in
total
peripheral
resistance
and
essentially
no
change
in
cardiac
output
following
propranolol
therapy
.

The
studies
suggest
that
propranolol
is
a
useful
drug
in
selected
patients
with
severe
idiopathic
orthostatic
hypotension
.

Total
intravenous
anesthesia
with
etomidate
.

III
.

Some
observations
in
adults
.

An
investigation
was
undertaken
to
determine
the
dosage
of
etomidate
required
to
maintain
sleep
in
adults
undergoing
surgery
under
regional
local
anesthesia
.

Premedication
of

diazepam
10
mg
and
atropine
0.5
mg
was
given
,
and
sleep
was
induced
and
maintained
by
intermittent
intravenous
injections
of
etomidate

0.1/mg
/
kg
,
given
whenever
the
patient
would
open
his
eyes
on
request
.

A
mean
overall
dose
of

etomidate
17.4
microgram
/
kg
/
min
.
was
required
to
maintain
sleep
,
but
great
individual
variation
occurred
,
with
older
patients
requiring
less
drug
.

The
investigation
was
discontinued
after
18
patients
because
of
the
frequency
and
intensity
of
side
-
effects
,
particularly
pain
and
myoclonia
,
which
caused
the
technique
to
be
abandoned
in
two
cases
.

It
is
considered
unlikely
that
etomidate
will
prove
to
be
the
hypnotic
of
choice
for
a
totally
intravenous
anesthetic
technique
in
adults
because
of
the
high
incidence
of
myoclonia
after
prolonged
administration
.

In
several
patients
uncontrollable
muscle
movements
persisted
for
many
minutes
after
complete
recovery
of
consciousness
.

A
method
for
the
measurement
of
tremor
,
and
a
comparison
of
the
effects
of
tocolytic
beta
-
mimetics
.

A
method
permitting
measurement
of
finger
tremor
as
a
displacement
-
time
curve
is
described
,
using
a
test
system
with
simple
amplitude
calibration
.

The
coordinates
of
the
inversion
points
of
the
displacement
-
time
curves
were
transferred
through
graphical
input
equipment
to
punched
tape
.

By
means
of
a
computer
program
,
periods
and
amplitudes
of
tremor
oscillations
were
calculated
and
classified
.

The
event
frequency
for
each
class
of
periods
and
amplitudes
was
determined
.

The
actions
of
fenoterol
-
hydrobromide
,
ritodrin
-
HCl
and
placebo
given
to
10
healthy
subjects
by
intravenous
infusion
in
a
double
-
blind
crossover
study
were
tested
by
this
method
.

At
therapeutic
doses
both
substances
raised
the
mean
tremor
amplitude
to
about
three
times
the
control
level
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
mean
period
within
each
class
of
amplitudes
shortened
by
10
-
-20
ms
,
whereas
the
mean
periods
calculated
from
all
oscillations
together
did
not
change
significantly
.

After
the
end
of
fenoterol
-
hydrobromide
infusion
,
tremor
amplitudes
decreased
significantly
faster
than
those
following
ritodrin
-
HCl
infusion
.

Cephalothin
-induced
immune
hemolytic
anemia
.

A
patient
with
renal
disease
developed
Coombs
-
positive
hemolytic
anemia
while
receiving
cephalothin
therapy
.

An
anti-
cephalothin
IgG
antibody
was
detected
in
the
patient
's
serum
and
in
the
eluates
from
her
erythrocytes
.

In
addition
,
nonimmunologic
binding
of
normal
and
patient
's
serum
proteins
to
her
own
and
cephalothin
-coated
normal
red
cells
was
demonstrated
.

Skin
tests
and
in
vitro
lymphocyte
stimulation
revealed
that
the
patient
was
sensitized
to
cephalothin
and
also
to
ampicillin
.

Careful
investigation
of
drug
-
induced
hemolytic
anemias
reveals
the
complexity
of
the
immune
mechanisms
involved
.

Kaliuretic
effect
of
L
-
dopa
treatment
in
parkinsonian
patients
.

Hypokalemia
,
sometimes
severe
,
was
observed
in
some
L
-
dopa
-treated

parkinsonian
patients
.

The
influence
of
L
-
dopa
on
the
renal
excretion
of
potassium
was
studied
in
3
patients
with
hypokalemia
and
in
5
normokalemic
patients
by
determination
of
renal
plasma
flow
,
glomerular
filtration
rate
,
plasma
concentration
of
potassium
and
sodium
as
well
as
urinary
excretion
of
potassium
,
sodium
and
aldosterone
.

L
-
Dopa
intake
was
found
to
cause
an
increased
excretion
of
potassium
,
and
sometimes
also
of
sodium
,
in
the
hypokalemic
but
not
in
the
normokalemic
patients
.

This
effect
on
the
renal
function
could
be
prohibited
by
the
administration
of
a
peripheral
dopa
decarbodylase
inhibitor
.

It
is
not
known
why
this
effect
occurred
in
some
individuals
but
not
in
others
,
but
our
results
indicate
a
correlation
between
aldosterone
production
and
this
renal
effect
of
L
-
dopa
.

Phenytoin

encephalopathy
as
probable
idiosyncratic
reaction
:
case
report
.

A
case
of
phenytoin

(
DPH
)
encephalopathy
with
increasing
seizures
and
EEG
and
mental
changes
is
described
.

Despite
adequate
oral
dosage
of
DPH

(
5
mg
/
kg
/
daily
)

the
plasma
level
was
very
low
(
2.8
microgramg
/
ml
)
.

The
encephalopathy
was
probably
an
idiosyncratic
and
not
toxic
or
allergic
reaction
.

In
fact
the
concentration
of
free
DPH
was
normal
,
the
patient
presented
a
retarded
morbilliform
rash
during
DPH
treatment
,
the
protidogram
was
normal
,
and
an
intradermic
DPH
injection
had
no
local
effect
.

The
authors
conclude
that
in
a
patient
starting
DPH
treatment
an
unexpected
increase
in
seizures
,
with
EEG
and
mental
changes
occurring
simultaneously
,
should
alert
the
physician
to
the
possible
need
for
eliminating
DPH
from
the
therapeutic
regimen
,
even
if
plasma
concentrations
are
low
.

Effects
of
exercise
on
the
severity
of
isoproterenol

-induced

myocardial
infarction
.

The
effect
of
exercise
on
the
severity
of

isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
infarction
was
studied
in
male
rats
.

Ninety
-
three
rats
were
randomly
divided
into
three
groups
.

The
exercise-

isoproterenol
(
E-1
)
and
exercise
control
(
EC
)
groups
exercised
daily
for
thirty
days
on
a
treadmill
at
1
mph
,
2
%
grade
while
animals
of
the
sedentary-
isoproterenol
(
S
-
I
)
group
remained
sedentary
.

Eight
animals
were
assigned
to
the
sedentary
control
(
SC
)
group
which
remained
sedentary
throughout
the
experimental
period
.

Forty
-
eight
hours
after
the
final
exercise
period
,
S
-
I
and
E
-
I
animals
received
a
single
subcutaneous
injection
of
isoproterenol

(
250
mg
/
kg
body
weight
)
.

Animals
of
the
S
-
I
group
exhibited
significantly
(
Pp
less
than
0.05
)
greater
mortality
from
the
effects
of
isoproterenol
than
animals
of
the
E
-
I
group
.

Serum
CPK
activity
for
E
-
I
animals
was
significantly
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
greater
than
for
animals
in
the
S
-
I
and
EC
groups
twenty
hours
following
isoproterenol
injection
.

No
statistically
significant
differences
were
observed
between
the
two
isoproterenol
treated
groups
for
severity
of
the
induced
lesions
,
changes
in
heart
weight
,
or
heart
weight
to
body
weight
ratios
.

The
results
indicated
that
exercise
reduced
the
mortality
associated
with
the
effects
of
large
dosages
of
isoproterenol
but
had
little
on
the
severity
of
the
infarction
.

Effect
of
D
-
Glucarates
on
basic
antibiotic
-
induced
renal
damage
in
rats
.

Dehydrated
rats
regularly
develop

acute
renal
failure
following
single
injection
of
aminoglycoside
antibiotics
combined
with
dextran
or
of
antibiotics
only
.

Oral
administration
of
2,5-di
-
O
-
acetyl
-
D
-
glucaro-1,4
-
6,3-dilactone
protected
rats
against
renal
failure
induced
by

kanamycin
-dextran
.

The
protective
effect
was
prevalent
among
D
-
glucarates
,
and
also
to
other
saccharic
acid
,
hexauronic
acids
and
hexaaldonic
acids
,
although
to
a
lesser
degree
,
but
not
to
a
hexaaldose
,
sugar
alcohols
,
substances
inthe
TCA
cycle
and
other
acidic
compounds
.

D
-
Glucarates
were
effective
against
renal
damage
induced
by
peptide
antibiotics
as
well
as
various
aminoglycoside
antibitocis
.

Dose
-
responses
were
observed
in
the
protective
effect
of
D
-
Glucarates
.

With
a
D
-
glucarate
of
a
fixed
size
of
dose
,
approximately
the
same
degree
of
protection
was
obtained
against
renal
damages
induced
by
different
basic
antibiotics
despite
large
disparities
in
administration
doses
of
different
antibiotics
.

D
-
Glucarates
had
the
ability
to
prevent
renal
damage
but
not
to
cure
it
.

Rats
excreted
acidic
urine
when
they
were
spared
from
renal
lesions
by
monosaccharides
.

The
reduction
effect
of
D
-
glucarates
against
nephrotoxicity
of
basic
antibiotics
was
discussed
.

Paraplegia
following
intrathecal
methotrexate
:
report
of
a
case
and
review
of
the
literature
.

A
patient
who
developed
paraplegia
following
the
intrathecal
instillation
of
methotrexate
is
discribed
.

The
ten
previously
reported
cases
of
this
unusual
complication
are
reviewed
.

The
following
factors
appear
to
predispose
to
the
development
of
this
complication
:
abnormal
cerebrospinal
dynamics
related
to
the
presence
of
central
nervous
system
leukemia
,
and
epidural
cerebrospinal
leakage
;
elevated
cerebrospinal
fluid
methothexate
concentration
related
to
abnormal
cerebrospinal
fluid
dynamics
and
to
inappropriately
high
methotrexate
doses
based
on
body
surface
area
calculations
in
older
children
and
adults
;
the
presence
of
neurotoxic
preservatives
in
commercially
available
methotrexate
preparations
and
diluents
;
and
the
use
of
methotrexate
diluents
of
unphysiologic
pH
,
ionic
content
and
osmolarity
.

The
role
of
methotrexate
contaminants
,
local
folate
deficiency
,
and
cranial
irradiation
in
the
pathogenesis
of
intrathecal
methotrexate

toxicity
is
unclear
.

The
incidence
of
neurotoxicity
may
be
reduced
by
employing
lower
doses
of
methotrexate
in
the
presence
of
central
nervous
system
leukemia
,
in
older
children
and
adults
,
and
in
the
presence
of
epidural
leakage
.

Only
preservative
-
free
methotrexate
in
Elliott
's
B
Solution
at
a
concentration
of
not
more
than
1
mg
/
ml
should
be
used
for
intrathecal
administration
.

Periodic
monitoring
of
cerebruspinal
fluid
methotrexate
levels
may
be
predictive
of
the
development
of
serious
neurotoxicity
.

Centrally
mediated
cardiovascular
effects
of
intracisternal
application
of
carbachol
in
anesthetized
rats
.

The
pressor
response
to
the
intracisternal
(
i.c
.
)

injection
of
carbachol

(
1
mug
)
in
anesthetized
rats
was
analyzed
.

This
response
was
significantly
reduced
by
the
intravenous
(
i.v
.
)

injection
of
guanethidine

(
5
mg
)
,
hexamethonium

(
10
mg
)
or
phentolamine
(
5
mg
)
,
and
conversely
,
potentiated
by
i.v
.

desmethylimipramine
(
0.3
mg
)
,

while
propranolol
(
0.5
mg
)
i.v
.

selectively
inhibited
the
enlargement
of
pulse
pressure
and
the
tachycardia
following
i.c
.

carbachol
(
1
mug
)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
pressor
response
to
i.c
.

carbachol
(
1
mug
)
was
almost
completely
blocked
by
i.c
.

atropine
(
3
mug
)
or
hexamethonium
(
500
mug
)
,
and
significantly
reduced
by
i.c
.

chlorpromazine
(
50
mug
)
but
significantly
potentiated
by
i.c
.

desmethylimipramine
(
30
mug
)
.

The
pressor
response
to
i.c
.

carbachol
(
1
mug
)
remained
unchanged
after
sectioning
of
the
bilateral
cervical
vagal
nerves
but
disappeared
after
sectioning
of
the
spinal
cord
(
C7-C8
)
.

From
the
above
result
it
is
suggested
that
the
pressor
response
to
i.c
.

carbachol
ortral
and
peripheral
adrenergic
mechanisms
,
and
that
the
sympathetic
trunk
is
the
main
pathway
.

Hyperglycemic
effect
of
amino
compounds
structurally
related
to
caproate
in
rats
.

The
chronic
feeding
of
small
amounts
(
0.3
-
3
%
of
diet
weight
)
of
certain
amino
derivatives
of
caproate
resulted
in
hyperglycemia
,
an
elevated
glucose
tolerance
curve
and
,
occasionally
,
glucosuria
.

Effective
compounds
included
norleucine
,
norvaline
,
glutamate
,
epsilon
-
aminocaproate
,
methionine
,
and
leucine
.

Fatty
liver
induced
by
tetracycline
in
the
rat
.

Dose
-
response
relationships
and
effect
of
sex
.

Dose
-
response
relationships
,
biochemical
mechanisms
,
and
sex
differences
in
the
experimental
fatty
liver
induced
by
tetracycline
were
studied
in
the
intact
rat
and
with
the
isolated
perfused
rat
liver
in
vitro
.

In
the
intact
male
and
female
rat
,
no
direct
relationship
was
observed
between
dose
of
tetracycline
and
hepatic
accumulation
of
triglyceride
.

With
provision
of
adequate
oleic
acid
as
a
substrate
for
the
isolated
perfused
liver
,
a
direct
relationship
was
observed
between
dose
of
tetracycline
and
both
accumulation
of
triglyceride
in
the
liver
and
depression
of
output
of
triglyceride
by
livers
from
male
and
female
rats
.

Marked
differences
were
observed
between
female
and
male
rats
with
regard
to
base
line
(
control
)
hepatic
concentration
of
triglyceride
and
output
of
triglyceride
.

Accumulation
of
hepatic
triglyceride
,
as
a
per
cent
of
control
values
,
in
response
to
graded
doses
of
tetracycline
,
did
not
differ
significantly
between
male
,
female
and
pregnant
rat
livers
.

However
,
livers
from
female
,
and
especially
pregnant
female
rats
,
were
strikingly
resistant
to
the
effects
of
tetracycline
on
depression
of
output
of
triglyceride
under
these
experimental
conditions
.

These
differences
between
the
sexes
could
not
be
related
to
altered
disposition
of
tetracycline
or
altered
uptake
of
oleic
acid
.

Depressed
hepatic
secretion
of
triglyceride
accounted
only
for
30
to
50
%
of
accumulated
hepatic
triglyceride
,
indicating
that
additional
mechanisms
must
be
involved
in
the
production
of
the
triglyceride
-rich
fatty
liver
in
response
to
tetracycline
.

Fatal
myeloencephalopathy
due
to
intrathecal
vincristine
administration
.

Vincristine
was
accidentally
given
intrathecally
to
a
child
with
leukaemia
,
producing
sensory
and
motor
dysfunction
followed
by
encephalopathy
and
death
.

Separate
times
for
administering
vincristine
and
intrathecal
therapy
is
recommended
.

Progesterone

,
we
determined
the
effect
of
1-hour
progesterone
HCl
exposure
on
myocyte
contractile
rhythm
.

Each
concentration
of
progesterone
(
6.25
,
12.5
,
25
,
and
50
micrograms
/
ml
)
caused
a
significant
and
concentration
-
dependent
reduction
in
the
AD50
for
bupivacaine
.

Estradiol
treatment
also
increased
the
arrhythmogenicity
of
bupivacaine
in
myocyte
cultures
,
but
was
only
one
fourth
as
potent
as
progesterone
.

Neither
progesterone
nor
estradiol
effects
on
bupivacaine
arrhythmogenicity
were
potentiated
by
epinephrine
.

Chronic
progesterone
pretreatment
(
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
for
21
days
)
caused
a
significant
increase
in
bupivacaine
arrhythmogenicity
in
intact
pentobarbital
-anesthetized
rats
.

There
was
a
significant
decrease
in
the
time
to
onset
of
arrhythmia
as
compared
with
control
nonprogesterone
-
treated
rats
(
6.2
+
/-
1.3
vs.
30.8
+
/-

2.5
min
,
mean

+
/-
SE
)
.

The
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
progesterone
can
potentiate
bupivacaine
arrhythmogenicity
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

Potentiation
of
bupivacaine
arrhythmia
in
myocyte
cultures
suggests
that
this
effect
is
at
least
partly
mediated
at
the
myocyte
level
.

Acute
renal
failure
occurring
during
intravenous
desferrioxamine
therapy
:
recovery
after
haemodialysis
.

A
patient
with
transfusion
-
dependent
thalassemia
was
undergoing
home
intravenous
desferrioxamine

(
DFX
)
treatment
by
means
of
a
totally
implanted
system
because
of
his
poor
compliance
with
the
nightly
subcutaneous
therapy
.

Due
to
an
accidental
malfunctioning
of
the
infusion
pump
,
the
patient
was
inadvertently
administered
a
toxic
dosage
of
the
drug
which
caused
renal
insufficiency
.

Given
the
progressive
deterioration
of
the
symptoms
and
of
the
laboratory
values
,
despite
adequate
medical
treatment
,
a
decision
was
made
to
introduce
haemodialytical
therapy
in
order
to
remove
the
drug
and
therapy
reduce
the
nephrotoxicity
.

From
the
results
obtained
,
haemodialysis
can
therefore
be
suggested
as
a
useful
therapy
in
rare
cases
of
progressive
acute
renal
failure
caused
by
desferrioxamine
.

Neuroleptic
-associated
hyperprolactinemia
.

Can
it
be
treated
with
bromocriptine
?

Six
stable
psychiatric
outpatients
with
hyperprolactinemia
and
amenorrhea
/
oligomenorrhea
associated
with
their
neuroleptic
medications
were
treated
with
bromocriptine
.

Daily
dosages
of
5
-
10
mg
corrected
the
hyperprolactinemia
and
restored
menstruation
in
four
of
the
six
patients
.

One
woman
,
however
,
developed
worsened
psychiatric
symptoms
while
taking
bromocriptine
,
and
it
was
discontinued
.

Thus
,
three
of
six
patients
had
their
menstrual
irregularity
successfully
corrected
with
bromocriptine
.

This
suggests
that
bromocriptine
should
be
further
evaluated
as
potential
therapy
for
neuroleptic

-associated

hyperprolactinemia
and
amenorrhea
/
galactorrhea

Ethacrynic
acid

.

Intracerebroventricular
injection
of
ethacrynic
acid

(
50
%

convulsive
dose
;
50
micrograms
/

)
accelerated
the
synthesis
/
turnover
of
5-hydroxytryptamine

(
5-HT
)
but
suppressed
the
synthesis
of
gamma

aminobutyric
acid
and
acetylcholine
in

These
effects
were
completely
antagonized
by
pretreatment
with
a
glutamate
/
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate
antagonist
,
aminophosphonovaleric
acid
.

In
ethacrynic
acid

-induced

convulsions
,
these
neurotransmitter
systems
may
be
differentially
modulated
,
probably
through
activation
of
glutaminergic
neurons
in
the

To

Recurrent
myocardial
infarction
in
a
postpartum
patient
receiving
bromocriptine
.

Myocardial
infarction
in
puerperium
is
infrequently
reported
.

Spasm
,
coronary
dissection
,
or
atheromatous
etiology
has
been
described
.

Bromocriptine
has
been
implicated
in
several
previous
case
reports
of
myocardial
infarction
in
the
puerperium
.

Our
case
(
including
an
inadvertent
rechallenge
)
suggests
such
a
relationship
.

Although
generally
regarded
as
"
safe
,
"
possible
serious
cardiac
effects
of
bromocriptine
should
be
acknowledged
.

Asterixis
induced
by
carbamazepine
therapy
.

There
are
very
few
reports
about
asterixis
as
a
side
effect
of
treatment
with
psychopharmacologic
agents
.

In
this
report
we
present
four
patients
treated
with
a
combination
of
different
psychotropic
drugs
,
in
whom
asterixis
was
triggered
either
by
adding
carbamazepine

(
CBZ
)
to
a
treatment
regimen
,
or
by
increasing
its
dosage
.

Neither
dosage
nor
serum
levels
of
CBZ
were
in
a
higher
range
.

We
consider
asterixis
to
be
an
easily
overlooked
sign
of
neurotoxicity
,
which
may
occur
even
at
low
or
moderate
dosage
levels
,
if
certain
drugs
as
lithium
or
clozapine
are
used
in
combination
with
CBZ
.

Pharmacodynamics
of
the
hypotensive
effect
of
levodopa
in
parkinsonian
patients
.

Blood
pressure
effects
of
i.v
.

levodopa
were
examined
in
parkinsonian
patients
with
stable
and
fluctuating
responses
to
levodopa
.

The
magnitude
of
the
hypotensive
effect
of
levodopa
was
concentration
dependent
and
was
fit
to
an
Emax
model
in
fluctuating
responders
.

Stable
responders
demonstrated
a
small
hypotensive
response
.

Baseline
blood
pressures
were
higher
in
fluctuating
patients
;
a
higher
baseline
blood
pressure
correlated
with
greater
hypotensive
effects
.

Antiparkinsonian
effects
of
levodopa
temporally
correlated
with
blood
pressure
changes
.

Phenylalanine
,
a
large
neutral
amino
acid

(
LNAA
)
competing
with
levodopa
for
transport
across
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
,
reduced
the
hypotensive
and
antiparkinsonian
effects
of
levodopa
.

We
conclude
that
levodopa
has
a
central
hypotensive
action
that
parallels
the
motor
effects
in
fluctuating
patients
.

The
hypotensive
effect
appears
to
be
related
to
the
higher
baseline
blood
pressure
we
observed
in
fluctuating
patients
relative
to
stable
patients
.

Syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone
after
infusional
vincristine
.

A
77-year
-
old
woman
with
refractory
multiple
myeloma
was
treated
with
a
4-day
continuous
intravenous
infusion
of
vincristine
and
doxorubicin
and
4
days
of
oral
dexamethasone
.

Nine
days
after
her
second
cycle
she
presented
with
lethargy
and
weakness
associated
with
hyponatremia
.

Evaluation
revealed
the
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
antidiuretic
hormone
,
which
was
attributed
to
the
vincristine
infusion
.

After
normal
serum
sodium
levels
returned
,
further
doxorubicin
and
dexamethasone
chemotherapy
without
vincristine
did
not
produce
this
complication
.

Heart
failure
:
to
digitalise
or
not
?

The
view
against
.

Despite
extensive
clinical
experience
the
role
of
digoxin
is
still
not
well
defined
.

In
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation

digoxin
is
beneficial
for
ventricular
rate
control
.

For
patients
in
sinus
rhythm
and
heart
failure

the
situation
is
less
clear
.

Digoxin
has
a
narrow
therapeutic
:

toxic
ratio
and
concentrations
are
affected
by
a
number
of
drugs
.

Also
,
digoxin
has
undesirable
effects
such
as
increasing
peripheral
resistance
and
myocardial
demands
,
and
causing
arrhythmias
.

There
is
a
paucity
of
data
from
well
-
designed
trials
.

The
trials
that
are
available
are
generally
small
with
limitations
in
design
and
these
show
variation
in
patient
benefit
.

More
convincing
evidence
is
required
showing
that
digoxin
improves
symptoms
or
exercise
capacity
.

Furthermore
,
no
trial
has
had
sufficient
power
to
evaluate
mortality
.

Pooled
analysis
of
the
effects
of
other
inotropic
drugs
shows
an
excess
mortality
and
there
is
a
possibility
that
digoxin
may
increase
mortality
after
myocardial
infarction

(
MI
)
.

Angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
should
be
used
first
as
they
are
safer
,
do
not
require
blood
level
monitoring
,
modify
progression
of
disease
,
relieve
symptoms
,
improve
exercise
tolerance
and
reduce
mortality
.

Caution
should
be
exercised
in
using
digoxin
until
large
mortality
trials
are
completed
showing
either
benefit
or
harm
.

Until
then
digoxin
should
be
considered
a
third
-
line
therapy
.

Mania
associated
with
fluoxetine
treatment
in
adolescents
.

Fluoxetine
,
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
,
is
gaining
increased
acceptance
in
the
treatment
of
adolescent
depression
.

Generally
safe
and
well
tolerated
by
adults
,
fluoxetine
has
been
reported
to
induce
mania
.

The
cases
of
five
depressed
adolescents
,
14
-
16
years
of
age
,
who
developed
mania
during
pharmacotherapy
with
fluoxetine
,
are
reported
here
.

Apparent
risk
factors
for
the
development
of
mania
or
hypomania
during
fluoxetine
pharmacotherapy
in
this
population
were
the
combination
of
attention

and
affective
instability
;
major
depression
with
psychotic
features
;
a
family
history
of
affective
disorder
,
especially
bipolar
disorder
;
and
a
diagnosis
of
bipolar
disorder
.

Further
study
is
needed
to
determine
the
optimal
dosage
and
to
identify
risk
factors
that
increase
individual
vulnerability
to
fluoxetine
induced
mania
in
adolescents

postlesion
failed
to
produce
a
pressor
response
.

One
day
postlesion
,
the
resting
mean
arterial
pressure
was
significantly
decreased
in
lesioned
rats
when
compared
with
sham
rats
(
100
+
/-
7
versus
173
+
/-
4
mm
Hg
,
p
less
than
0.05
)
.

Fifteen
days
later
,
the
lesioned
group
still
showed
values
significantly
lower
than
the
sham
group
(
150
+
/-
6
versus
167
+
/-
5
mm
Hg
,

p
less
than
0.05
)
.

No
significant
heart
rate
differences
were
observed
between
the
sham
and
lesioned
groups
.

The
ganglionic
blocker
trimethaphan

(
5
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)
caused
similar
reductions
in
mean
arterial
pressure
in
both
lesioned
and
sham
groups
.

The
trimethaphan
-induced
hypotension
was
accompanied
by
a
significant
bradycardia
in
lesioned
rats
(
-32
+

/-
13
beats
per
minute
)
but
a
tachycardia
in
sham
rats
(
+
33
+
/-

12
beats
per
minute
)
1
day
postlesion
.

Therefore
,
rostral
ventrolateral
medulla
neurons
appear
to
play
a
significant
role
in
maintaining
hypertension
in
conscious
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
.

Spinal
or
suprabulbar
structures
could
be
responsible
for
the
gradual
recovery
of
the
hypertension
in
the
lesioned
rats
.

Damage
of
substantia
nigra
pars
reticulata
during
pilocarpine
-induced

status
epilepticus
in
the
rat
:
immunohistochemical
study
of
neurons
,
astrocytes
and
serum
-
protein
extravasation
.

The
substantia
nigra
has
a
gating
function
controlling
the
spread
of
epileptic
seizure
activity
.

Additionally
,
in
models
of
prolonged
status
epilepticus

the
pars
reticulata
of
substantia
nigra
(
SNR
)
suffers
from
a
massive
lesion
which
may
arise
from
a
massive
metabolic
derangement
and
hyperexcitation
developing
in
the
activated
SNR
.

In
this
study
,
status
epilepticus
was
induced
by
systemic
injection
of
pilocarpine
in
rats
.

The
neuropathology
of
SNR
was
investigated
using
immunohistochemical
techniques
with
the
major
emphasis
on
the
time
-
course
of
changes
in
neurons
and
astrocytes
.

Animals
surviving
20
,
30
,
40
,
60
min
,
2
,
3
,
6
hours
,
1
,
2
,
and
3
days
after
induction
of
status
epilepticus
were
perfusion
-
fixed
,
and
brains
processed
for
immunohistochemical
staining
of
SNR
.

Nissl
-
staining
and
antibodies
against
the
neuron
-
specific
calcium
-binding
protein
,
parvalbumin
,
served
to
detect
neuronal
damage
in
SNR
.

Antibodies
against
the
astroglia
-
specific
cytoskeletal
protein
,
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
(
GFAP
)
,
and
against
the
glial
calcium
-binding
protein
,
S-100
protein
,
were
used
to
assess
the
status
of
astrocytes
.

Immunohistochemical
staining
for
serum
-
albumin
and
immunoglobulins
in
brain
tissue
was
taken
as
indicator
of
blood
-
brain
barrier
disturbances
and
vasogenic
edema
formation
.

Immunohistochemical
staining
indicated
loss
of
GFAP
-
staining
already
at
30
min
after
induction
of
seizures
in
an
oval
focus
situated
in
the
center
of
SNR
while
sparing
medial
and
lateral
aspects
.

At
1
h
there
was
additional
vacuolation
in
S-100
protein
staining
.

By
2
hours
,
parvalbumin
-
staining
changed
in
the
central
SNR
indicating
neuronal
damage
,
and
Nissl
-
staining
visualized
some
neuronal
distortion
.

Staining
for
serum
-
proteins
occurred
in
a
patchy
manner
throughout
the
forebrain
during
the
first
hours
.

By
6
h
,
vasogenic
edema
covered
the
lesioned
SNR
.

By
24
h
,
glial
and
neuronal
markers
indicated
a
massive
lesion
in
the
center
of
SNR
.

By
48
-
72
h
,
astrocytes
surrounding
the
lesion
increased
in
size
,
and
polymorphic
phagocytotic
cells
invaded
the
damaged
area
.

In
a
further
group
of
animals
surviving
1
to
5
days
,
conventional
paraffin
-
sections
confirmed
the
neuronal
and
glial
damage
of
SNR
.

Additional
pathology
of
similar
quality
was
found
in
the
globus
pallidus
.

Since
astrocytes
were
always
damaged
in
parallel
with
neurons
in
SNR
it
is
proposed
that
the
anatomical
and
functional
interrelationship
between
neurons
and
astrocytes
is
particularly
tight
in
SNR
.

Both
cell
elements
may
suffer
in
common
from
metabolic
disturbance
and
neurotransmitter
dysfunction
as
occur
during
massive
status
epilepticus
.

Reduced

of

doxorubicin
given
in
the
form
of
N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide

In
these

,
DOX
was
covalently

.

In
addition
,
one
biodegradable

used
;
this

Over
the
first
3
weeks
after
the
i.v

administration
of
free

,
all

However
,
the
maximal
reduction
in

seen
in
animals
that
received
polymer

DOX

(
4

was

Throughout
the

(
20

,
deaths
related
to
cardiotoxicity
were
observed
only
in
animals
that
received
either
free
DOX
or
the
mixture
of
HPMA

;
in
these
cases
,
histological

revealed
marked
changes
in
the
heart
that
were
consistent
with
DOX
-induced

.

Sequential

of
cardiac
output
in
surviving
animals
that
received
either
free
DOX
or
the

DOX
showed
a
reduction
of
approximately
30
%
in

beginning
at
the
4th

.

The
heart

was
approximately
12
%
lower
than
that
measured
in

(

.

Animals
that
were
given
the
HPMA

containing
DOX
exhibited
no
significant
change
in
cardiac
output
throughout
the
study
(

39

,
were
treated
with
0.025

capsaicin
cream
for
8
weeks
.

During
therapy
the
patients
rated
their
pain
on
a
visual
analogue
scale
(
VAS
)
and
a
verbal

.

A

was
performed
10

12
months
after
study
onset
on
the
patients
who
had
improved

Nineteen
patients
(
48.7
%
)
substantially
improved
after
the
8-week
trial
;
5
(
12.8
%
)
discontinued

due
to
side

such
as

(

)
or

(

;
15
(

reported
no

.

The
decrease
in

was
significant
after
2
weeks
of

.

Of
the

72.2
%
were
still

at
the

.

If
confirmed
in
controlled
trials
,
the
long

term
results
of
this
open
,
non
-
randomized
study
might
indicate
that
the
analgesic
effect
of
capsaicin
in
PHN
is
mediated
by
both
interference
with
neuropeptide
metabolism
and
morphological
changes
(
perhaps
degeneration
)
of

afferents
.

Serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
,
paranoia
,
and
the
ventral
basal
ganglia
.

Antidepressants
have
previously
been
associated
with
paranoid
reactions
in
psychiatric
patients
.

Five
cases
of
paranoid
exacerbation
with
the
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
fluoxetine
and
amitriptyline
are
reported
here
.

Elements
common
to
these
cases
included
a
history
of
paranoid
symptomatology
and
the
concomitant
occurrence
of
depressive
and
psychotic
symptoms
.

Complicated
depressive
disorders
(
including
atypicality
of
course
and
symptomatology
,
chronicity
,
psychosis
,
bipolarity
,
and
secondary
onset
in
the
course
of
a
primary
psychosis
)

may
present
particular
vulnerability
to
paranoid
exacerbations
associated
with
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
.

Although
the
pharmacology
and
neurobiology
of
paranoia
remain
cryptic
,
several
mechanisms
,
including
5HT3
receptor
-
mediated
dopamine
release
,
beta
-
noradrenergic
receptor
downregulation
,
or
GABAB
receptor
upregulation
acting
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ventral
basal
ganglia
(
possibly
in
lateral
orbitofrontal
or
anterior
cingulate
circuits
)
,
might
apply
to
this
phenomenon
.

These
cases
call
attention
to
possible
paranoid
exacerbations
with
serotonin
reuptake
blockers
in
select
patients
and
raise
neurobiological
considerations
regarding
paranoia
.

Five
cases
of
encephalitis
during
treatment
of
loiasis
with
diethylcarbamazine
.

Five
cases
of
encephalitis
following
treatment
with
diethylcarbamazine

(
DEC
)
were
observed
in
Congolese
patients
with
Loa
loa
filariasis
.

Two
cases
had
a
fatal
outcome
and
one
resulted
in
severe
sequelae
.

The
notable
fact
was
that
this
complication
occurred
in
three
patients
hospitalized
before
treatment
began
,
with
whom
particularly
strict
therapeutic
precautions
were
taken
,
i.e.
,
initial
dose
less
than
10
mg
of
DEC
,
very
gradual
dose
increases
,
and
associated
anti
-
allergic
treatment
.

This
type
of
drug
-
induced
complication
may
not
be
that
uncommon
in
highly
endemic
regions
.

It
occurs
primarily
,
but
not
exclusively
,
in
subjects
presenting
with
a
high
microfilarial
load
.

The
relationship
between
the
occurrence
of
encephalitis
and
the
decrease
in
microfilaremia
is
evident
.

The
pathophysiological
mechanisms
are
discussed
in
the
light
of
these
observations
and
the
few
other
comments
on
this
subject
published
in
the
literature

Delirium
in
an
elderly
woman
possibly
associated
with
administration
of
misoprostol
.

Misoprostol
has
been
associated
with
adverse
reactions
,
including
gastrointestinal
symptoms
,
gynecologic
problems
,
and
headache
.

Changes
in
mental
status
,
however
,
have
not
been
reported
.

We
present
a
case
in
which
an
89-year
-
old
woman
in
a
long
-
term
care
facility
became
confused
after
the
initiation
of
misoprostol
therapy
.

The
patient
's
change
in
mental
status
was
first
reported
nine
days
after
the
initiation
of
therapy
.

Her
delirium
significantly
improved
after
misoprostol
was
discontinued
and
her
mental
status
returned
to
normal
within
a
week
.

Because
no
other
factors
related
to
this
patient
changed
significantly
,
the
delirium

experienced
by
this
patient
possibly
resulted
from
misoprostol
therapy
.

Hepatocellular
oxidant
stress
following
intestinal
ischemia
-
reperfusion
injury
.

Reperfusion
of
ischemic

intestine
results
in
acute
liver
dysfunction
characterized
by
hepatocellular
enzyme
release
into
plasma
,
reduction
in
bile
flow
rate
,
and
neutrophil
sequestration
within
the
liver
.

The
pathophysiology
underlying
this
acute
hepatic
injury
is
unknown
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
whether
oxidants
are
associated
with
the
hepatic
injury
and
to
determine
the
relative
value
of
several
indirect
methods
of
assessing
oxidant
exposure
in
vivo
.

Rats
were
subjected
to
a
standardized
intestinal
ischemia
-
reperfusion
injury
.

Hepatic
tissue
was
assayed
for
lipid
peroxidation
products
and
oxidized
and
reduced
glutathione
.

There
was
no
change
in
hepatic
tissue
total
glutathione
following
intestinal
ischemia
-
reperfusion
injury
.

Oxidized
glutathione

(
GSSG
)
increased
significantly
following
30
and
60
min
of
reperfusion
.

There
was
no
increase
in
any
of
the
products
of
lipid
peroxidation
associated
with
this
injury
.

An
increase
in
GSSG
within
hepatic
tissue
during
intestinal
reperfusion
suggests
exposure
of
hepatocytes
to
an
oxidant
stress
.

The
lack
of
a
significant
increase
in
products
of
lipid
peroxidation
suggests
that
the
oxidant
stress
is
of
insufficient
magnitude
to
result
in
irreversible
injury
to
hepatocyte
cell
membranes
.

These
data
also
suggest
that
the
measurement
of
tissue
GSSG
may
be
a
more
sensitive
indicator
of
oxidant
stress
than
measurement
of
products
of
lipid
peroxidation
.

Diphenhydramine
prevents
the
haemodynamic
changes
of
cimetidine
in
ICU
patients
.

Cimetidine
,
a
histamine
2
(
H2
)
antagonist
,
produces
a
decrease
in
arterial
pressure
due
to
vasodilatation
,
especially
in
critically
ill
patients
.

This
may
be
because
cimetidine
acts
as
a
histamine
agonist
.

We
,
therefore
,
investigated
the
effects
of
the
histamine

1(H1
)
receptor
antagonist
,
diphenhydramine
,
on
the
haemodynamic
changes
observed
after
cimetidine
in
ICU
patients
.

Each
patient
was
studied
on
two
separate
days
.

In
a
random
fashion
,
they
received

cimetidine
200
mg
iv
on
one
day
,
and
on
the
other
,
a
pretreatment
of
diphenhydramine

40
mg
iv
with
cimetidine

200
mg
iv
.

In
the
non
-
pretreatment
group
,
mean
arterial
pressure
(
MAP
)
decreased
from
107.4
+
/-

8.4
mmHg
to
86.7
+
/-

11.4
mmHg
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
two
minutes
after
cimetidine
.

Also
,
systemic
vascular
resistance
(
SVR
)
decreased
during
the
eight
-
minute
observation
period
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
.

In
contrast
,
in
the
pretreatment
group
,
little
haemodynamic
change
was
seen
.

We
conclude
that
an
H1
antagonist
may
be
useful
in
preventing
hypotension
caused
by
iv
cimetidine
,
since
the
vasodilating
activity
of
cimetidine
is
mediated
,
in
part
,
through
the
H1
receptor
.

Acute
renal
failure
due
to
rifampicin
.

A
23-year
-
old
male
patient
with
bacteriologically
proven
pulmonary
tuberculosis
was
treated
with
the
various
regimens
of
antituberculosis
drugs
for
nearly
15
months
.

Rifampicin
was
administered
thrice
as
one
of
the
3

4
drug
regimen
and
each
time
he
developed
untoward
side
effects
like
nausea
,
vomiting
and

was
of

have
been
described
with

To

,
however
,
axonal

In

of
the
fact
that
TSPA
is
a
useful
IT
agent
,
its
combination
with
MTX
,
ara
-
C
and
radiotherapy
could
cause
severe
neurotoxicity
.

This
unexpected
complication
indicates
the
need
for
further
toxicology
research
on
IT-
TSPA
.

Effects
of
cromakalim
and
pinacidil
on
large
epicardial
and
small
coronary
arteries
in
conscious
dogs
.

The
effects
of
i.v
.

bolus
administration
of
cromakalim

(
1
-
10
micrograms
/
kg
)
and
pinacidil

(
3
-
100
micrograms
/
kg
)
on
large
(
circumflex
artery
)
and
small
coronary
arteries
and
on
systemic
hemodynamics
were
investigated
in
chronically
instrumented
conscious
dogs
and
compared
to
those
of
nitroglycerin
(
0.03
-
10
micrograms
/
kg
)
.

Nitroglycerin
,
up
to
0.3
micrograms
/
kg
,
selectively
increased
circumflex
artery
diameter
(
CxAD
)
without
simultaneously
affecting
any
other
cardiac
or
systemic
hemodynamic
parameter
.

In
contrast
,
cromakalim
and
pinacidil
at
all
doses
and
nitroglycerin
at
doses
higher
than
0.3
micrograms
/
kg
simultaneously
and
dose
-
dependently
increased
CxAD
,
coronary
blood
flow
and
heart
rate
and
decreased
coronary
vascular
resistance
and
aortic
pressure
.

Cromakalim
was
approximately

8-
to
9.5-fold
more
potent
than
pinacidil
in
increasing
CxAD
.

Vasodilation
of
large
and
small
coronary
vessels
and
hypotension
induced
by
cromakalim
and
pinacidil
were
not
affected
by
prior
combined
beta
adrenergic
and
muscarinic
receptors
blockade
but
drug
-
induced
tachycardia
was
abolished
.

When
circumflex
artery
blood
flow
was
maintained
constant
,
the
increases
in
CxAD
induced
by
cromakalim

(
10
micrograms
/
kg
)
,
pinacidil

(
30
micrograms
/
kg
)
and
nitroglycerin

(
10
micrograms
/
kg
)
were
reduced
by
68
+
/-
7
,
54
+
/-

9
and
1
+
/-
1
%
,
respectively
.

Thus
,
whereas
nitroglycerin
preferentially
and
flow
-
independently
dilates
large
coronary
arteries
,
cromakalim
and
pinacidil
dilate
both
large
and
small
coronary
arteries
and
this
effect
is
not
dependent
upon
the
simultaneous
beta
adrenoceptors
-
mediated
rise
in
myocardial
metabolic
demand
.

Finally
,
two
mechanisms
at
least
,
direct
vasodilation
and
flow
dependency
,
are
involved
in
the
cromakalim
-
and
pinacidil
-induced
increase
in
CxAD
.

Mefenamic
acid
-induced
neutropenia
and
renal
failure
in
elderly
females
with
hypothyroidism
.

We
report

mefenamic
acid
-induced
non
-
oliguric
renal
failure
and
severe
neutropenia
occurring
simultaneously
in
two
elderly
females
.

The
neutropenia
was
due
to
maturation
arrest
of
the
myeloid
series
in
one
patient
.

Both
patients
were
also
hypothyroid
,
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
this
was
a
predisposing
factor
to
the
development
of
these
adverse
reactions
.

However
,
it
would
seem
prudent
not
to
use
mefenamic
acid
in
hypothyroid
patients
until
the
hypothyroidism
has
been
corrected

Methyldopa
-induced
hemolytic
anemia
in
a
15
year
old
presenting
as
near-
syncope
.

Methyldopa
is
an
antihypertensive
medication
which
is
available
generically
and
under
the
trade
name
Aldomet
that
is
widely
prescribed
in
the
adult
population
and
infrequently
used
in
children
.

Methyldopa
causes
an
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
in
a
small
percentage
of
patients
who
take
the
drug
.

We
report
a
case
of
methyldopa
-induced
hemolytic
anemia
in
a
15-year
-
old
boy
who
presented
to
the
emergency
department
with
near-
syncope
.

The
boy
had
been
treated
with
intravenous
methyldopa
during
a
trauma
admission
seven
weeks
prior
to
presentation
.

Evaluation
revealed
a
hemoglobin
of
three
grams
,
3
+
Coombs
'
test
with
polyspecific
anti
-
human
globulin
and
monospecific
IgG
reagents
,
and
a
warm
reacting
autoantibody
.

Transfusion
and
corticosteroid
therapy
resulted
in
a
complete
recovery
of
the
patient
.

Emergency
physicians
treating
children
must
be
aware
of
this
syndrome
in
order
to
diagnose
and
treat
it
correctly
.

A
brief
review
of
autoimmune
and
drug
-
induced
hemolytic
anemias
is
provided
.

The
long
-
term
safety
of
danazol
in
women
with
hereditary
angioedema
.

Although
the
short
-
term
safety
(
less
than
or
equal
to
6
months
)
of
danazol
has
been
established
in
a
variety
of
settings
,
no
information
exists
as
to
its
long
-
term
safety
.

We
therefore
investigated
the
long
-
term
safety
of
danazol
by
performing
a
retrospective
chart
review
of
60
female
patients
with
hereditary
angioedema
treated
with
danazol
for
a
continuous
period
of
6
months
or
longer
.

The
mean
age
of
the
patients
was
35.2
years
and
the
mean
duration
of
therapy
was
59.7
months
.

Virtually
all
patients
experienced
one
or
more
adverse
reactions
.

Menstrual
abnormalities
(
79
%
)
,
weight
gain

(
60
%
)
,
muscle
cramps
/
myalgias
(
40
%
)
,
and
transaminase
elevations
(
40
%
)
were
the
most
common
adverse
reactions
.

The
drug
was
discontinued
due
to
adverse
reactions
in
8
patients
.

No
patient
has
died
or
suffered
any
apparent
long
-
term
sequelae
that
were
directly
attributable
to
the
drug
.

We
conclude
that
,
despite
a
relatively
high
incidence
of
adverse
reactions
,
danazol
has
proven
to
be
remarkably
safe
over
the
long
-
term
in
this
group
of
patients
.

Patient
tolerance
study
of
topical
chlorhexidine
diphosphanilate
:
a
new
topical
agent
for
burns
.

Effective
topical
antimicrobial
agents
decrease
infection
and
mortality
in
burn
patients
.

Chlorhexidine
phosphanilate

(
CHP
)
,
a
new
broad
-
spectrum
antimicrobial
agent
,
has
been
evaluated
as
a
topical
burn
wound
dressing
in
cream
form
,
but
preliminary
clinical
trials
reported
that
it
was
painful
upon
application
.

This
study
compared
various
concentrations
of
CHP
to
determine
if
a
tolerable
concentration
could
be
identified
with
retention
of
antimicrobial
efficacy
.

Twenty
-
nine

burn
patients
,
each
with
two
similar
burns
which
could
be
separately
treated
,
were
given
pairs
of
treatments
at
successive
12-h
intervals
over
a
3-day
period
.

One
burn
site
was
treated
with
each
of
four
different
CHP
concentrations
,
from
0.25
per
cent
to
2
per
cent
,
their
vehicle
,
and
1
per
cent
silver
sulphadiazine

(
AgSD
)
cream
,
an
antimicrobial
agent
frequently
used
for
topical
treatment
of
burn
wounds
.

The
other
site
was
always
treated
with
AgSD
cream
.

There
was
a
direct
relationship
between
CHP
concentration
and
patients
'
ratings
of
pain
on
an
analogue
scale
.

The
0.25
per
cent
CHP
cream
was
closest
to
AgSD
in
pain
tolerance
;
however
,
none
of
the
treatments
differed
statistically
from
AgSD
or
from
each
other
.

In
addition
,
ease
of
application
of
CHP
creams
was
less
satisfactory
than
that
of
AgSD
.

It
was
concluded
that
formulations
at
or
below
0.5
per
cent

CHP
may
prove
acceptable
for
wound
care
,
but
the
vehicle
system
needs
pharmaceutical
improvement
to
render
it
more
tolerable
and
easier
to
use
.

Dose
-
dependent
neurotoxicity
of
high
-
dose
busulfan
in
children
:
a
clinical
and
pharmacological
study
.

Busulfan
is
known
to
be
neurotoxic
in
animals
and
humans
,
but
its
acute
neurotoxicity
remains
poorly
characterized
in
children
.

We
report
here
a
retrospective
study
of
123
children
(
median
age
,
6.5
years
)
receiving
high
-
dose
busulfan
in
combined
chemotherapy
before
bone
marrow
transplantation
for
malignant
solid
tumors
,

brain
tumors
excluded
.

Busulfan
was
given
p.o
.

,
every
6
hours
for
16
doses
over
4
days
.

Two
total
doses
were
consecutively
used
:
16
mg
/
kg
,
then
600
mg
/
m2
.

The
dose
calculation
on
the
basis
of
body
surface
area
results
in
higher
doses
in
young
children
than
in
older
patients
(
16
to
28
mg
/
kg
)
.

Ninety
-
six
patients
were
not
given
anticonvulsive
prophylaxis
;
7
(
7.5
%
)
developed

seizures
during
the
4
days
of
the
busulfan
course
or
within
24
h

after
the
last
dosing
.

When
the
total
busulfan
dose
was
taken
into
account
,
there
was
a
significant
difference
in
terms
of
neurotoxicity
incidence
among
patients
under
16
mg
/
kg
(
1
of
57
,
1.7
%
)
and
patients
under
600
mg
/
m2
(
6
of
39
,
15.4
%
)

(
P
less
than
0.02
)
.

Twenty
-
seven
patients
were
given
a
600-mg
/
m2
busulfan
total
dose
with
continuous
i.v
.

infusion
of
clonazepam
;
none
had
any
neurological
symptoms
.

Busulfan
levels
were
measured
by
a
gas
chromatographic
-
mass
spectrometry
assay
in
the
plasma
and
cerebrospinal
fluid
of
9
children
without
central
nervous
system
disease

under
600
mg
/
m2
busulfan
with

clonazepam
:
busulfan
cerebrospinal
fluid
:

plasma
ratio
was
1.39
.

This
was
significantly
different
(
P
less
than
0.02
)
from
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
:
plasma
ratio
previously
defined
in
children
receiving
a
16-mg
/
kg
total
dose
of
busulfan
.

This
study
shows
that
busulfan

neurotoxicity
is
dose
-
dependent
in
children
and
efficiently
prevented
by
clonazepam
.

A
busulfan
dose
calculated
on
the
basis
of
body
surface
area
,
resulting
in
higher
doses
in
young
children
,
was
followed
by
increased
neurotoxicity
,
close
to
neurotoxicity
incidence
observed
in
adults
.

Since
plasma
pharmacokinetic
studies
showed
a
faster
busulfan
clearance
in
children
than
in
adults
,
this
new
dose
may
approximate
more
closely
the
adult
systemic
exposure
obtained
after
the
usual
16-mg
/
kg
total
dose
,
with
potential
inferences
in
terms
of
anticancer
or
myeloablative
effects
.

The
busulfan
dose
in
children
and
infants
undergoing
bone
marrow
transplantation
should
be
reconsidered
on
the
basis
of
pharmacokinetic
studies
.

Histamine
antagonists
and
d
-
tubocurarine
-induced

hypotension
in
cardiac
surgical
patients
.

Hemodynamic
effects
and
histamine
release
by
bolus
injection
of
0.35
mg
/
kg
of
d
-
tubocurarine
were
studied
in
24
patients
.

H1-
and
H2-
histamine
antagonists
or
placebo
were
given
before
dosing
with
d
-
tubocurarine
in
a
randomized
double
-
blind
fashion
to
four
groups
:
group
1
-
-placebo
;
group
2
-
-
cimetidine
,
4
mg
/
kg
,
plus
placebo
;
group
3
-
-
chlorpheniramine
,
0.1
mg
/
kg
,
plus
placebo
;
and
group
4
-
-
cimetidine
plus
chlorpheniramine
.

Histamine
release
occurred
in
most
patients
,
the
highest
level
2
minutes
after
d
-
tubocurarine
dosing
.

Group
1
had
a
moderate
negative
correlation
between
plasma
histamine
change
and
systemic
vascular
resistance
(
r
=
0.58
;
P
less
than
0.05
)
not
present
in
group
4
.

Prior
dosing
with
antagonists
partially
prevented
the
fall
in
systemic
vascular
resistance
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
the
hemodynamic
changes
associated
with
d
-
tubocurarine
dosing
are
only
partially
explained
by
histamine
release
.

Thus
prior
dosing
with
H1-

and
H2-antagonists
provides
only
partial
protection
.

Convulsant
effect
of
lindane
and
regional
brain
concentration
of
GABA
and
dopamine
.

Lindane

(
gamma
-
hexachlorocyclohexane
)
is
an
organochlorine
insecticide
with
known
neurotoxic
effects
.

Its
mechanism
of
action
is
not
well
understood
although
it
has
been
proposed
that
lindane
acts
as
a
non
-
competitive
antagonist
at
the
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid

(
GABA
)
-A
receptor
.

We
studied
the
effect
of
lindane

(
150
mg
/
kg
)
on
the
GABAergic
and
dopaminergic
systems
by
measuring
the
concentration
of
GABA
,

dopamine
and
its
metabolites
in
7
brain
areas
at
the
onset
of
seizures
.

All
animals
suffered
tonic
convulsions
at
18.3
+
/-

1.4
min
after
lindane
administration
.

The
concentration
of
GABA
was
only
slightly
but
significantly
decreased
in
the
colliculi
without
modifications
in
the
other
areas
.

The
concentration
of
dopamine
was
increased
in
the
mesencephalon
and
that
of
its
metabolite
DOPAC
was
also
increased
in
the
mesencephalon
and
the
striatum
.

Unusual
complications
of
antithyroid
drug
therapy
:
four
case
reports
and
review
of
literature
.

Two
cases
of
propylthiouracil

-associated
acute
hepatitis
,
one
case
of
fatal
methimazole
-associated
hepatocellular
necrosis
and
one
case
of
propylthiouracil
-associated
lupus
-
like
syndrome
are
described
.

The
literature
related
to
antithyroid
drug
side
effects
and
the
mechanisms
for
their
occurrence
are
reviewed
and
the
efficacy
and
complications
of
thyroidectomy
and
radioiodine
compared
to
those
of
antithyroid
drugs
.

It
is
concluded
that
in
most
circumstances
131I
is
the
therapy
of
choice
for
hyperthyroidism
.

Anticonvulsant
actions
of
MK-801
on
the
lithium
-
pilocarpine
model
of
status
epilepticus
in
rats
.

MK-801
,
a
noncompetitive
N
-
methyl
-
D
-
aspartate

(
NMDA
)
receptor
antagonist
,
was
tested
for
anticonvulsant
effects
in
rats
using
two
seizure
models
,
coadministration
of
lithium
and
pilocarpine
and
administration
of
a
high
dose
of
pilocarpine
alone
.

Three
major
results
are
reported
.

First
,
pretreatment
with
MK-801
produced
an
effective
and
dose
-
dependent
anticonvulsant
action
with
the
lithium
-
pilocarpine
model
but
not
with
rats
treated
with
pilocarpine
alone
,
suggesting
that
different
biochemical
mechanisms
control

seizures
in
these
two
models
.

Second
,
the
anticonvulsant
effect
of
MK-801
in
the
lithium
-
pilocarpine
model
only
occurred
after
initial
periods
of
seizure
activity
.

This
observation
is
suggested
to
be
an
in
vivo
demonstration
of
the
conclusion
derived
from
in
vitro
experiments
that
MK-801
binding
requires
agonist
-
induced
opening
of
the
channel
sites
of
the
NMDA
receptor
.

Third
,
although
it
is
relatively
easy
to
block
seizures
induced
by
lithium
and
pilocarpine
by
administration
of
anticonvulsants
prior
to
pilocarpine
,
it
is
more
difficult
to
terminate
ongoing
status
epilepticus
and
block
the
lethality
of
the
seizures
.

Administration
of

MK-801
30
or
60
min
after
pilocarpine
,
i.e.
,
during
status
epilepticus
,
gradually
reduced
electrical
and
behavioral
seizure
activity
and
greatly
enhanced
the
survival
rate
.

These
results
suggest
that
activation
of
NMDA
receptors
plays
an
important
role
in
status
epilepticus
and
brain
damage
in
the
lithium
-
pilocarpine
model
.

This
was
further
supported
by
results
showing
that
nonconvulsive
doses
of
NMDA
and
pilocarpine
were
synergistic
,
resulting
in
status
epilepticus
and
subsequent
mortality
.

Nifedipine
induced

bradycardia
in
a
patient
with
autonomic
neuropathy
.

An
80
year
old
diabetic

male
with
evidence
of
peripheral
and
autonomic
neuropathy
was
admitted
with
chest
pain
.

He
was
found
to
have
atrial
flutter
at
a
ventricular
rate
of
70/min
which
slowed
down
to
30
-
40/min
when
nifedipine
(
60
mg
)
in
3
divided
doses
,
during
which
he
was
paced
at
a
rate
of
70/min
.

This
is
inconsistent
with
the
well
-
established
finding
that
nifedipine
induces
tachycardia
in
normally
innervated
hearts
.

However
,
in
hearts
deprived
of
compensatory
sympathetic
drive
,
it
may
lead
to
bradycardia
.

The
effect
of
haloperidol
in
cocaine
and
amphetamine
intoxication
.

The
effectiveness
of
haloperidol
pretreatment
in
preventing
the
toxic
effects
of
high
doses
of
amphetamine
and
cocaine
was
studied
in
rats
.

In
this
model
,
toxic
effects
were
induced
by
intraperitoneal
(
i.p
.
)

injection
of
amphetamine
75
mg
/
kg
(
100
%
death
rate
)
or
cocaine
70
mg
/
kg
(
82
%
death
rate
)
.

Haloperidol
failed
to
prevent
amphetamine
-induced
seizures
,
but
did
lower
the
mortality
rate
at
most
doses
tested
.

Haloperidol
decreased
the
incidence
of
cocaine
-induced
seizures
at
the
two
highest
doses
,
but
the
lowering
of
the
mortality
rate
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
at
any
dose
.

These
data
suggest
a
protective
role
for
the
central
dopamine
blocker
haloperidol
against
death
from
high
-
dose
amphetamine
exposure
without
reducing
the
incidence
of
seizures
.

In
contrast
,
haloperidol
demonstrated
an
ability
to
reduce
cocaine
-induced

seizures
without
significantly
reducing
mortality
.

Autoradiographic
evidence
of
estrogen
binding
sites
in
nuclei
of

diethylstilbesterol
induced
hamster
renal
carcinomas
.

Estrogen
binding
sites
were
demonstrated
by
autoradiography
in
one
transplantable
and
five
primary
diethylstilbesterol
induced
renal
carcinomas
in
three
hamsters
.

Radiolabelling
,
following
the
in
vivo
injection
of
3H-17
beta
estradiol
,
was
increased
only
over
the
nuclei
of
tumor
cells
;
stereologic
analysis
revealed
a
4.5-
to
6.7-times
higher
concentration
of
reduced
silver
grains
over
nuclei
than
cytoplasm
of
these
cells
.

Despite
rapid
tubular
excretion
of
estradiol
which
peaked
in
less
than
1
h
,
the
normal
cells
did
not
appear
to
bind
the
ligand
.

This
is
the
first
published
report
documenting
the
preferential
in
vivo
binding
of
estrogen
to
nuclei
of
cells
in
estrogen
induced
hamster
renal
carcinomas
.

Bradycardia
due
to
biperiden
.

In
a
38-year
-
old
male
patient
suffering
from
a
severe
postzosteric

trigeminal
neuralgia
,
intravenous
application
of
10
mg
biperiden
lactate
led
to
a
long
-
lasting
paradoxical
reaction
characterized
by
considerable
bradycardia
,
dysarthria
,
and
dysphagia
.

The
heart
rate
was
back
to
normal
within
12
hours
upon
administration
of
orciprenaline
under
cardiac
monitoring
in
an
intensive
care
unit
.

Bradycardia
induced
by
biperiden
is
attributed
to
the
speed
of
injection
and
to
a
dose
-
related
dual
effect
of
atropine
-like
drugs
on
muscarine
receptors
.

Deliberate

as
a

In

,
the
patients
received
fentanyl

.

The
initial

of
labetalol
for
lowering
blood
pressure
was
similar
,
0.52

0.59
mg

,
in
all
the
groups
.

During
hypotension
,
the
heart

was
stable
without
tachy-
or
bradycardia
.

The
operating
conditions
regarding
bleeding
were
estimated
in
a
double

blind
manner
,
and
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
groups
.

During
hypotension
,
the
serum
creatinine
concentration
rose
significantly
in
all
groups
from
the
values
before
hypotension
and
returned
postoperatively
to
the
initial
level
in
the
other
groups
,
except
the
isoflurane
group
.

After
hypotension

there
was
no
rebound
phenomenon
in
either
blood
pressure
or
heart
rate
.

These
results
indicate
that
labetalol
induces
easily
adjustable
hypotension
without
compensatory
tachycardia
and
rebound
hypertension
.

Pharmacology
of
ACC-9653

(
phenytoin

)
.

ACC-9653
,
the
disodium
phosphate
ester
of
3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin
,
is
a
prodrug
of
phenytoin
with
advantageous
physicochemical
properties
.

ACC-9653
is
rapidly
converted
enzymatically
to
phenytoin
in

.

ACC-9653
and

ACC-9653
and

The

In

,
a
high

and
the

were
compared
to

Phenytoin
induced

.

A

.

A
typical
multisystem
clinical
pattern
precedes

The
hematologic

In

early
recognition
and
discontinuation
of

Support
for
adrenaline

hypertension

hypothesis
:
18
hour
pressor
effect
after
6
hours
adrenaline
infusion
.

In
a
double
blind
,
crossover
study
6
h
infusions
of
adrenaline

(
15
ng
/
kg
/
min
;
1
ng

)
,
noradrenaline

(
30
ng

;
1
ng

5.911
pmol
)
,
and
a
5
%
dextrose
solution
(
5.4
ml
/
h
)
,
were
given
to
ten
healthy
volunteers
in
random
order
2
weeks
apart
.

By
means
of
intra
-
arterial
ambulatory
monitoring
the
haemodynamic
effects
were
followed
for
18
h
after
the
infusions
were
stopped
.

Adrenaline
,
but
not
noradrenaline
,
caused
a
delayed
and
protracted
pressor
effect
.

Over
the
total
postinfusion
period
systolic
and
diastolic
arterial
pressure
were
6

(
2)%
,
respectively
,
higher
than
after

.

Thus
,
"

"
levels
of
adrenaline

(
230
pg

cause

a

Effect
of
alkylxanthines
on
gentamicin
-induced

acute
renal
failure
in
the
rat
.

Adenosine
antagonists
have
been
previously
shown
to
be
of
benefit
in
some
ischaemic
and
nephrotoxic
models
of
acute
renal
failure

(
ARF
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
effects
of
three
alkylxanthines
with
different
potencies
as
adenosine
antagonists
8-phenyltheophylline
,
theophylline
and
enprofylline
,
were
examined
in
rats
developing
acute
renal
failure
after
4
daily
injections
of
gentamicin

(
200
mg
kg-1
)
.

Renal
function
was
assessed
by
biochemical
(
plasma
urea
and
creatinine
)
,
functional
(
urine
analysis
and
[
3H]inulin
and
[
14C
]
p
-
aminohippuric
acid
clearances
)
and
morphological
(
degree
of
necrosis
)
indices
.

The
various
drug
treatments
produced
improvements
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
measurements
of
renal
function
.

However
,
any
improvement
produced
by
drug
treatment
was
largely
a
result
of
a
beneficial
effect
exerted
by
its
vehicle
(
polyethylene
glycol
and
NaOH
)
.

The
lack
of
any
consistent
protective
effect
noted
with
the
alkylxanthines
tested
in
the
present
study
indicates
that
adenosine
plays
little
,
if
any
,
pathophysiological
role
in
gentamicin

-induced

ARF
.

Adverse
ocular
reactions
possibly
associated
with
isotretinoin
.

A
total
of
261
adverse
ocular
reactions
occurred
in
237
patients
who
received
isotretinoin
,
a
commonly
used
drug
in
the
treatment
of
severe
cystic
acne
.

Blepharoconjunctivitis
,
subjective
complaints
of
dry
eyes
,
blurred
vision
,
contact
lens
intolerance
,
and
photodermatitis
are
reversible
side
effects
.

More
serious
ocular
adverse
reactions
include
papilledema
,
pseudotumor
cerebri
,
and
white
or
gray
subepithelial
corneal
opacities
;
all
of
these
are
reversible
if
the
drug
is
discontinued
.

Reported
cases
of
decreased
dark
adaptation
are
under
investigation
.

Isotretinoin
is
contraindicated
in
pregnancy
because
of
the
many
reported
congenital
abnormalities
after
maternal
use
(
including
microphthalmos
,

,
and
terbutaline

,
were
compared
when
given
randomly
in
1-week
treatment
periods
.

The
best
clinical
effect
was
found
with
terbutaline
.

Both
anti-
asthmatic
and
tremorgenic
effects
of
procaterol
were
dose
-
related
.

Procaterol
appeared
effective
in
the
doses
tested
,
and
a
twice
daily
regimen
would
appear
to
be
suitable
with
this
drug
.

Subacute
effects
of
propranolol
and
B
24/76
on
isoproterenol
-induced
rat
heart
hypertrophy
in
correlation
with
blood
pressure
.

We
compared
the
potential
beta
-
receptor
blocker
,
B
24/76
i.e.
1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2
-
3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-prop
an-2-ol
,
which
is
characterized
by
beta
1-adrenoceptor
blocking
and
beta
2-adrenoceptor
stimulating
properties
with
propranolol
.

The
studies
were
performed
using
an
experimental
model
of
isoproterenol
-induced
heart
hypertrophy
in
rats
.

A
correlation
of
the
blood
pressure
was
neither
found
in
the
development
nor
in
the
attempt
to
suppress
the
development
of
heart
hypertrophy
with
the
two
beta
-
receptor
blockers
.

Both
beta
-
blockers
influenced
the
development
of
hypertrophy
to
a
different
,
but
not
reproducible
extent
.

It
was
possible
to
suppress
the
increased
ornithine

decarboxylase
activity
with
both
beta
-
blockers
in
hypertrophied
hearts
,
but
there
was
no
effect
on
the
heart
mass
.

Neither
propranolol
nor
B
24/76
could
stop
the
changes
in
the
characteristic
myosin
isoenzyme
pattern
of
the
hypertrophied
rat
heart
.

Thus
,
the
investigations
did
not
provide
any
evidence
that
the
beta
-
receptor
blockers
propranolol
and
B
24/76
have
the
potency
to
prevent
isoproterenol
from
producing
heart
hypertrophy
.

,
was
significantly
reduced
in
the
periods
when
either
active
drug
was
taken
,
whereas
no
difference
was
noticed
during
the
placebo
administration
.

No
significant
difference
was
noticed
between
results
obtained
with
either
active
drug
,
as
well
as
with
either
dosage
of
oxitropium
.

No
subject
reported
side
effects
of
oxitropium
,
as
compared
to
three
subjects
reporting
nausea
,
vomiting
and
tremors
after
theophylline
.

Oxitropium
proves
to
be
a
valuable
alternative
to
theophylline
in
nocturnal
asthma
,
since
it
is
equally
potent
,
safer
and
does
not
require
the
titration
of
dosage
.

Penicillin

,
and
the
terminology
,
occurrence
,
clinical
manifestations
,

Emergency
physicians
should
be
aware
of
oral
penicillin

anaphylaxis
in
order
to
prevent
its
occurrence
by
prescribing
the

judiciously
and
knowledgeably
and

Reversible
valproic
acid

-induced

dementia
:
a
case
report
.

Reversible
valproic
acid

-induced

dementia
was
documented
in
a
21-year
-
old
man
with
epilepsy
who
had
a
3-year
history
of
insidious
progressive
decline
in
global
cognitive
abilities
documented
by
serial
neuropsychological
studies
.

Repeat
neuropsychological
testing
7
weeks
after
discontinuation
of
the
drug
revealed
dramatic
improvement
in
IQ
,
memory
,
naming
,
and
other
tasks
commensurate
with
clinical
recovery
in
his
intellectual
capacity
.

Possible
pathophysiological
mechanisms
which
may
have
been
operative
in
this
case
include
:
a
direct
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
toxic
effect
of
valproic
acid
;
a
paradoxical
epileptogenic
effect
secondary
to
the
drug
;
and
an
indirect
CNS
toxic
effect
mediated
through
valproic
acid

-induced

hyperammonemia
.

Reversal
of
scopolamine
-induced
amnesia
of
passive
avoidance
by
pre-
and
post
-
training
naloxone
.

In
a
series
of
five
experiments
,
the
modulating
role
of
naloxone
on
a
scopolamine
-induced

retention
deficit
in
a
passive
avoidance
paradigm
was
investigated
in
mice
.

Scopolamine
,
but
not

methyl
scopolamine
(
1
and
3
mg
/
kg
)
,
induced
an
amnesia
as
measured
by
latency
and
duration
parameters
.

Naloxone
(
0.3
,
1
,
3
,
and
10
mg
/
kg
)
injected
prior
to
training
attenuated
the
retention
deficit
with
a
peak
of
activity
at
3
mg
/
kg
.

The
effect
of
naloxone
could
be
antagonized
with
morphine

(
1
,
3
,
and
10
mg
/
kg
)
,
demonstrating
the
opioid
specificity
of
the
naloxone
effect
.

Post
-
training
administration
of
naloxone

(
3
mg
/
kg
)
as
a
single
or
as
a
split
dose
also
attenuated
the
scopolamine
-induced
amnesia
.

Control
experiments
indicated
that
neither
an
increase
in
pain
sensitivity
(
pre
-
training
naloxone
)
nor
an
induced
aversive
state
(
post
-
training
naloxone
)
appear
to
be
responsible
for
the
influence
of
naloxone
on
the
scopolamine
-induced
retention
deficit
.

These
results
extend
previous
findings
implicating
a
cholinergic
-
opioid
interaction
in
memory
processes
.

A
possible
mechanism
for
this
interaction
involving
the
septo
-
hippocampal
cholinergic
pathway
is
discussed
.

Electron
microscopic
investigations
of
the
cyclophosphamide
-induced

lesions
of
the
urinary
bladder
of
the
rat
and
their
prevention
by
mesna
.

Fully
developed

cyclophosphamide
-induced

cystitis
is
characterized
by
nearly
complete
detachment
of
the
urothelium
,
severe
submucosal

edema

owing
to
damage
to
the
microvascular
bed
and
focal
muscle
necroses
.

The
initial
response
to
the
primary
attack
by
the
cyclophosphamide
metabolites
seems
to
be
fragmentation
of
the
luminal
membrane
.

This
damages
the
cellular
barrier
against
the
hypertonic
urine
.

Subsequent
breaks
in
the
lateral
cell
membranes
of
the
superficial
cells
and
in
all
the
plasma
membranes
of
the
intermediate
and
basal
cells
,
intercellular
and
intracellular
edema
and
disintegration
of
the
desmosomes
and
hemidesmosomes
lead
to
progressive
degeneration
and
detachment
of
the
epithelial
cells
with
exposure
and
splitting
of
the
basal
membrane
.

The
morphological
changes
of
the
endothelial
cells
,
which
become
more
pronounced
in
the
later
stages
of
the
experiment
,
the
involvement
of
blood
vessels
regardless
of
their
diameter
and
the
location
-
dependent
extent
of
the
damage
indicate
a
direct
type
of
damage
which
is
preceded
by
a
mediator
-
induced
increase
in
permeability
,
the
morphological
correlate
of
which
is
the
formation
of
gaps
in
the
interendothelial
cell
connections
on
the
venules
.

These
changes
can
be
effectively
prevented
by
mesna
.

The
only
sign
of
a
possible
involvement
is
the
increase
in
the
number
of
specific
granules
with
a
presumed
lysosomal
function
in
the
superficial
cells
.

Increase
in
intragastric
pressure
during
suxamethonium
-induced
muscle
fasciculations
in
children
:
inhibition
by
alfentanil
.

Changes
in
intragastric
pressure
after
the
administration
of
suxamethonium

1.5
mg
kg-1
i.v
.
were
studied
in
32
children
(
mean
age
6.9
yr
)
pretreated
with
either
physiological
saline
or
alfentanil
50
micrograms
kg-1
.

Anaesthesia
was
induced
with
thiopentone

5
mg
kg-1
.

The
incidence
and
intensity
of
muscle
fasciculations
caused
by
suxamethonium
were
significantly
greater
in
the
control
than
in
the
alfentanil
group
.

The
intragastric
pressure
during
muscle
fasciculations
was
significantly
higher
in
the
control
group
(
16
+
/-

0.7
(
SEM
)
cm
H2O
)
than
in
the
alfentanil
group
(
7.7
+
/-
1.5
(
SEM
)
cm
H2O
)
.

The
increase
in
intragastric
pressure
was
directly
related
to
the
intensity
of
muscle
fasciculations

(
regression
line
:
y
=
0.5
+
4.78x
with
r
of
0.78
)
.

It
is
concluded
that
intragastric
pressure
increases
significantly
during
muscle
fasciculations
caused
by
suxamethonium
in
healthy
children
.

Alfentanil
50
micrograms
kg-1
effectively
inhibits
the
incidence
and
intensity
of
suxamethonium

-induced

muscle
fasciculations
;
moreover
,
intragastric
pressure
remains
at
its
control
value
.

Acute
insulin
treatment
normalizes
the
resistance
to
the
cardiotoxic
effect
of
isoproterenol
in
streptozotocin
diabetic
rats
.

A
morphometric
study
of
isoproterenol
induced
myocardial
fibrosis
.

The
acute
effect
of
insulin
treatment
on
the
earlier
reported
protective
effect
of
streptozotocin
diabetes
against
the
cardiotoxic
effect
of
high
doses
of
isoproterenol

(
ISO
)
was
investigated
in
rats
.

Thirty
to
135
min
after
the
injection
of
crystalline
insulin
,
ISO
was
given
subcutaneously
and
when
ISO
induced
fibrosis
in
the
myocardium
was
morphometrically
analyzed
7
days
later
,
a
highly
significant
correlation
(
r
=
0.83
,
2
p
=
0.006
)
to
the
slope
of
the
fall
in
blood

glucose
after
insulin
treatment
appeared
.

The
myocardial
content
of
catecholamines
was
estimated
in
these
8
day

diabetic
rats
.

The
norepinephrine
content
was
significantly
increased
while
epinephrine
remained
unchanged
.

An
enhanced
sympathetic
nervous
system
activity
with
a
consequent
down
regulation
of
the
myocardial
beta
-
adrenergic
receptors
could
,
therefore
,
explain
this
catecholamine
resistance
.

The
rapid
reversion
after
insulin
treatment
excludes
the
possibility
that
streptozotocin
in
itself
causes
the
ISO
resistance
and
points
towards
a
direct
insulin
effect
on
myocardial
catecholamine
sensitivity
in
diabetic
rats
.

The
phenomenon
described
might
elucidate
pathogenetic
mechanisms
behind
toxic
myocardial
cell
degeneration
and
may
possibly
have
relevance
for
acute
cardiovascular
complications
in
diabetic
patients
.

Differential
effects
of
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
on
seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
in
rats
.

The
muscarinic
cholinergic
agonist
pilocarpine
induces
in
rats
seizures
and
status
epilepticus
followed
by
widespread
damage
to
the
forebrain
.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
investigate
the
effect
of
5
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
,
sodium
salicylate
,
phenylbutazone
,
indomethacin
,
ibuprofen
and
mefenamic
acid
,
on
seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
.

Pretreatment
of
rats
with
sodium
salicylate
,
ED50
103
mg
/
kg
(
60
-
174
)
,
and
phenylbutazone
,
59
mg
/
kg
(
50
-
70
)
converted
the
non
-
convulsant
dose
of
pilocarpine
,
200
mg
/
kg
,
to
a
convulsant
one
.

Indomethacin
,
1
-
10
mg
/
kg
,
and
ibuprofen
,
10
-
100
mg
/
kg
,
failed
to
modulate

seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
.

Mefenamic
acid
,
26
(
22
-
30
)
mg
/
kg
,
prevented

seizures
and
protected
rats
from
seizure

-related

brain
damage
induced
by
pilocarpine
,
380
mg
/
kg
.

These
results
indicate
that
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
differentially
modulate
the
threshold
for
pilocarpine

-induced

seizures
.

Acute
neurologic
dysfunction
after
high
-
dose
etoposide
therapy
for
malignant
glioma
.

Etoposide

(
VP-16
-
213
)
has
been
used
in
the
treatment
of
many
solid
tumors
and
hematologic
malignancies
.

When
used
in
high
doses
and
in
conjunction
with
autologous
bone
marrow
transplantation
,
this
agent
has
activity
against
several
treatment
-
resistant
cancers
including
malignant
glioma
.

In
six
of
eight
patients
(
75
%
)
who
we
treated
for
recurrent
or
resistant
glioma
,
sudden
severe
neurologic
deterioration
occurred
.

This
developed
a
median
of
9
days
after
initiation
of
high
-
dose
etoposide
therapy
.

Significant
clinical
manifestations
have
included
confusion
,
papilledema
,
somnolence
,
exacerbation
of
motor
deficits
,
and
sharp
increase
in
seizure
activity
.

These
abnormalities
resolved
rapidly
after
initiation
of
high
-
dose
intravenous
dexamethasone
therapy
.

In
all
patients
,
computerized
tomographic
(
CT
)
brain
scans
demonstrated
stability
in
tumor
size
and
peritumor
edema
when
compared
with
pretransplant
scans
.

This
complication
appears
to
represent
a
significant
new
toxicity
of
high
-
dose
etoposide
therapy
for
malignant
glioma
.

Progressive
bile
duct
injury
after
thiabendazole
administration
.

A
27-yr
-
old
man
developed
jaundice

2
wk
after
exposure
to
thiabendazole
.

Cholestasis
persisted
for
3
yr
,
at
which
time
a
liver
transplant
was
performed
.

Two
liver
biopsy
specimens
and
the
hepatectomy
specimen
were
remarkable
for
almost
complete
disappearance
of
interlobular
bile
ducts
.

Prominent
fibrosis
and
hepatocellular
regeneration
were
also
present
;
however
,
the
lobular
architecture
was
preserved
.

This
case
represents
an
example
of
"
idiosyncratic
"
drug
-
induced
liver
damage
in
which
the
primary
target
of
injury
is
the
bile
duct
.

An
autoimmune
pathogenesis
of
the
bile
duct
destruction
is
suggested
.

Differential
effects
of
1,4-dihydropyridine

calcium
channel
blockers
:
therapeutic
implications
.

Increasing
recognition
of
the
importance
of
calcium
in
the
pathogenesis
of
cardiovascular
disease
has
stimulated
research
into
the
use
of
calcium
channel
blocking
agents
for
treatment
of
a
variety
of
cardiovascular
diseases
.

The
favorable
efficacy
and
tolerability
profiles
of
these
agents
make
them
attractive
therapeutic
modalities
.

Clinical
applications
of
calcium
channel
blockers
parallel
their
tissue
selectivity
.

In
contrast
to
verapamil
and
diltiazem
,
which
are
roughly
equipotent
in
their
actions
on
the
heart
and
vascular
smooth
muscle
,
the
dihydropyridine
calcium
channel
blockers
are
a
group
of
potent
peripheral
vasodilator
agents
that
exert
minimal
electrophysiologic
effects
on
cardiac
nodal
or
conduction
tissue
.

As
the
first
dihydropyridine
available
for
use
in
the
United
States
,
nifedipine
controls

angina
and
hypertension
with
minimal
depression
of
cardiac
function
.

Additional
members
of
this
group
of
calcium
channel
blockers
have
been
studied
for
a
variety
of
indications
for
which
they
may
offer
advantages
over
current
therapy
.

Once
or
twice
daily
dosage
possible
with
nitrendipine
and
nisoldipine
offers
a
convenient
administration
schedule
,
which
encourages
patient
compliance
in
long
-
term
therapy
of
hypertension
.

The
coronary
vasodilating
properties
of
nisoldipine
have
led
to
the
investigation
of
this
agent
for
use
in
angina
.

Selectivity
for
the
cerebrovascular
bed
makes
nimodipine
potentially
useful
in
the
treatment
of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
,
migraine
headache
,
dementia
,
and
stroke
.

In
general
,
the
dihydropyridine
calcium
channel
blockers
are
usually
well
tolerated
,
with
headache
,
facial
flushing
,
palpitations
,
edema
,
nausea
,
anorexia
,
and
dizziness
being
the
more
common
adverse
effects
.

The
enhancement
of
aminonucleoside
nephrosis
by
the
co
-
administration
of
protamine
.

An
experimental
model
of
focal
segmental
glomerular
sclerosis

(
FSGS
)
was
developed
in
rats
by
the
combined
administration
of
puromycin
-
aminonucleoside

(
AMNS
)
and
protamine
sulfate

(
PS
)
.

Male
Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
,
uninephrectomized
three
weeks
before
,
received
daily
injections
of
subcutaneous
AMNS
(
1
mg/100
g
body
wt
)
and
intravenous
PS

(
2
separated
doses
of
2.5
mg/100
g
body
wt
)
for
four
days
.

The
series
of
injections
were
repeated
another
three
times
at
10
day
intervals
.

The
animals
were
sacrificed
on
days
24
,
52
,
and
80
.

They
developed
nephrotic
syndrome
and
finally
renal
failure
.

The
time
-
course
curve
of
creatinine
clearance
dropped
and
showed
significant
difference
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
from
that
of
each
control
group
,
such
as
,
AMNS
alone
,
PS
alone
or
saline
injected
.

Their
glomeruli
showed
changes
of
progressive
FSGS
.

The
ultrastructural
studies
in
the
initial
stage
revealed
significant
lack
of
particles
of
perfused
ruthenium
red
on
the
lamina
rara
externa
and
marked
changes
in
epithelial
cell
cytoplasm
.

Therefore
,
it
is
suggested
that
the
administration
of
PS
enhances
the
toxicity
of
AMNS
on
the
glomerulus
and
readily
produces
progressive
FSGS
in
rats
resulting
in
the
end
-
stage
renal
disease
.

Theophylline
neurotoxicity
in
pregnant
rats
.

The
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
the
neurotoxicity
of
theophylline
is
altered
in
advanced
pregnancy
.

Sprague
-
Dawley
rats
that
were
20
days
pregnant
and
nonpregnant
rats
of
the
same
age
and
strain
received
infusions
of
aminophylline
until
onset
of
maximal
seizures
which
occurred
after
28
and
30
minutes
respectively
.

Theophylline
concentrations
at
this
endpoint
in
serum
(
total
)
and
CSF
were
similar
but
serum
(
free
)
and
brain
concentrations
were
slightly
different
in
pregnant
rats
.

Theophylline
serum
protein
binding
determined
by
equilibrium
dialysis
was
lower
in
pregnant
rats
.

Fetal
serum
concentrations
at
onset
of
seizures
in
the
mother
were
similar
to
maternal
brain
and
CSF
concentrations
and
correlated
significantly
with
the
former
.

It
is
concluded
that
advanced
pregnancy
has
a
negligible
effect
on
the
neurotoxic
response
to
theophylline
in
rats
.

Hyperkalemia
induced
by
indomethacin
and
naproxen
and
reversed
by
fludrocortisone
.

We
have
described
a
patient
with
severe
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
a
history
of
mefenamic
acid
nephropathy

in
whom
hyperkalemia
and
inappropriate
hypoaldosteronism
were
caused
by
both
indomethacin
and
naproxen
,
without
major
decline
in
renal
function
.

It
is
likely
that
preexisting
renal
disease
predisposed
this
patient
to
type
IV
renal
tubular
acidosis
with
prostaglandin
synthetase
inhibitors
.

Because
he
was
unable
to
discontinue
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
therapy
,
fludrocortisone
was
added
,
correcting
the
hyperkalemia
and
allowing
indomethacin
therapy
to
be
continued
safely
.

Hypotension
as
a
manifestation
of
cardiotoxicity
in
three
patients
receiving
cisplatin
and
5-fluorouracil
.

Cardiac
symptoms
,
including
hypotension
,
developed
in
three
patients
with
advanced
colorectal
carcinoma
while
being
treated
with
cisplatin

(
CDDP
)
and
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
.

In
two
patients
,
hypotension
was
associated
with
severe
left
ventricular
dysfunction
.

All
three
patients
required
therapy
discontinuation
.

Cardiac
enzymes
remained
normal
despite
transient
electrocardiographic
(
EKG
)
changes
.

The
presentation
and
cardiac
evaluation
(

of

Fatal
aplastic
anemia
in
a
patient
treated
with
carbamazepine
.

A
case
of
fatal
aplastic
anemia
due
to
carbamazepine
treatment
in
an
epileptic
woman
is
reported
.

Despite
concerns
of
fatal
bone
marrow
toxicity
due
to
carbamazepine
,
this
is
only
the
fourth
documented
and
published
report
.

Carbamazepine
is
a
safe
drug
,
but
physicians
and
patients
should
be
aware
of
the
exceedingly
rare
but
potentially
fatal
side
effects
,
better
prevented
by
clinical
than
by
laboratory
monitoring
.

Participation
of
a
bulbospinal
serotonergic
pathway
in
the
rat
brain
in
clonidine
-induced
hypotension
and
bradycardia
.

The
effects
of
microinjection
of
clonidine

(
1
-
10
micrograms
in
1
microliter
)
into
a
region
adjacent
to
the
ventrolateral
surface
of
the
medulla
oblongata
on
cardiovascular
function
were
assessed
in
urethane
-anesthetized
rats
.

Intramedullary
administration
of
clonidine
,
but
not
saline
vehicle
,
caused
a
dose
-
dependent
decrease
in
both
the
mean
arterial
pressure
and
the
heart
rate
.

The
clonidine
-induced
hypotension
was
antagonized
by
prior
spinal
transection
,
but
not
bilateral
vagotomy
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
clonidine
-induced
bradycardia
was
antagonized
by
prior
bilateral
vagotomy
,
but
not
spinal
transection
.

Furthermore
,
selective
destruction
of
the
spinal
5-HT
nerves
,
produced
by
bilateral
spinal
injection
of
5,7-dihydroxytryptamine
,
reduced
the
magnitude
of
the
vasodepressor
or
the
bradycardiac
responses
to
clonidine
microinjected
into
the
area
near
the
ventrolateral
surface
of
the
medulla
oblongata
in
rats
.

The
data
indicate
that
a
bulbospinal
serotonergic
pathway
is
involved
in
development
of
clonidine
-induced
hypotension
and
bradycardia
.

The
induced
hypotension
is
brought
about
by
a
decrease
in
sympathetic
efferent
activity
,
whereas
the
induced
bradycardia
was
due
to
an
increase
in
vagal
efferent
activity
.

Hypertension
in

neuroblastoma
induced
by
imipramine
.

Hypertension
is
a
well
-
known
finding
in
some
patients
with
neuroblastoma
.

However
,
it
has
not
previously
been
described
in
association
with
the
use
of
Imipramine
.

We
report
the
occurrence
of
severe
hypertension
(
blood
pressure
190/160
)
in
a
4-year
-
old
girl
with
neuroblastoma
who
was
given
Imipramine
to
control
a
behavior
disorder
.

It
was
determined
later
that
this
patient
's
tumor
was
recurring
at
the
time
of
her
hypertensive
episode
.

Since
she
had
no
blood
pressure
elevation
at
initial
diagnosis
and
none
following
discontinuation
of
the
Imipramine

(
when
she
was
in
florid
relapse
)
,
we
believe
that
this
drug
rather
than
her
underlying
disease
alone
caused
her
hypertension
.

The
mechanism
for
this
reaction
is
believed
to
be
increased
levels
of
vasoactive
catecholamines
due
to
interference
of
their
physiologic
inactivation
by
Imipramine
.

From
this
experience
,
we
urge
extreme
caution
in
the
use
of
tricyclic
antidepressants
in
children
with
active
neuroblastoma
.

Rechallenge
of
patients
who
developed
oral
candidiasis
or
hoarseness
with
beclomethasone
dipropionate
.

Of
158
asthmatic
patients
who
were
placed
on
inhaled

beclomethasone
,
15
(
9.5
%
)
developed
either
hoarseness

(
8)
,
oral
thrush
(
6
)
,
or
both
(
1
)
.

When
their
adverse
reactions
subsided
,
seven
of
these
15
patients
were
rechallenged
with
inhaled
beclomethasone
.

These
included
five
cases
who
developed
hoarseness
and
three
who
developed
Candidiasis
.

One
patient
had
both
.

Oral
thrush
did
not
recur
,
but
60
%
(
3/5
)
of
patients
with
hoarseness
had
recurrence
.

We
conclude
that
patients
may
be
restarted
on
inhaled

beclomethasone
when
clinically
indicated
;
however
,
because
of
the
high
recurrence
rate
,
patients
who
develop
hoarseness
should
not
be
re
-
challenged
.

Concomitant
use
of
oral
prednisone
and
topical
beclomethasone
may
increase
the
risk
of
developing
hoarseness
or
candidiasis
.

Cyclophosphamide

cardiotoxicity
:
an
analysis
of
dosing
as
a
risk
factor
.

Patients
who
undergo
bone
marrow
transplantation
are
generally
immunosuppressed
with
a
dose
of
cyclophosphamide

(
CYA
)
which
is
usually
calculated
based
on
the
patient
's
weight
.

At
these
high
doses
of
CYA
,
serious
cardiotoxicity
may
occur
,
but
definitive
risk
factors
for
the
development
of
such
cardiotoxicity
have
not
been
described
.

Since
chemotherapeutic
agent
toxicity
generally
correlates
with
dose
per
body
surface
area
,
we
retrospectively
calculated
the
dose
of
CYA
in
patients
transplanted
at
our
institution
to
determine
whether
the
incidence
of
CYA
cardiotoxicity
correlated
with
the
dose
per
body
surface
area
.

Eighty
patients
who
were
to
receive
CYA
50
mg
/
kg

/
d
for
four
days
as
preparation
for
marrow
grafting
underwent
a
total
of
84
transplants
for
aplastic
anemia
,
Wiskott
-
Aldrich
syndrome
,
or
severe
combined
immunodeficiency
syndrome
.

Fourteen
of
84
(
17
%
)

patients
had
symptoms
and
signs
consistent
with
CYA

cardiotoxicity
within
ten
days
of
receiving
1
to
4
doses
of
CYA
.

Six
of
the
14
patients
died
with
congestive
heart
failure
.

The
dose
of
CYA
per
body
surface
area
was
calculated
for
all
patients
and
the
patients
were
divided
into
two
groups
based
on
daily
CYA
dose
:
Group
1
,
CYA
less
than
or
equal
to
1.55
g
/
m2/d
;
Group
2
,
CYA
greater
than
1.55
g
/
m2/d
.

Cardiotoxicity

that
was
thought
to
be
related
to
CYA
occurred
in
1/32
(
3
%
)
of
patients
in
Group
1
and
in
13/52
(
25
%
)

patients
in
Group
2
(
P
less
than
0.025
)
.

Congestive
heart
failure
caused
or
contributed
to
death
in
0/32
patients
in
Group
1

v
6/52
(
12
%
)
of
patients
in
Group
2
(
P
less
than
0.25
)
.

There
was
no
difference
in
the
rate
of
engraftment
of
evaluable
patients
in
the
two
groups
(
P
greater
than
0.5
)
.

We
conclude
that
the
CYA
cardiotoxicity
correlates
with
CYA
dosage
as
calculated
by
body
surface
area
,
and
that
patients
with
aplastic
anemia
and
immunodeficiencies
can
be
effectively
prepared
for
bone
marrow
grafting
at
a
CYA
dose
of
1.55
g
/
m2/d
for
four
days
with
a
lower
incidence
of
cardiotoxicity
than
patients
whose
CYA
dosage
is
calculated
based
on
weight
.

This
study
reaffirms
the
principle
that
drug
toxicity
correlates
with
dose
per
body
surface
area
.

Studies
of
risk
factors
for
aminoglycoside
nephrotoxicity
.

The
epidemiology
of
aminoglycoside

-induced

nephrotoxicity
is
not
fully
understood
.

Experimental
studies
in
healthy
human
volunteers
indicate
aminoglycosides
cause
proximal
tubular
damage
in
most
patients
,
but
rarely
,
if
ever
,
cause
glomerular
or
tubular
dysfunction
.

Clinical
trials
of
aminoglycosides
in
seriously
ill
patients
indicate
that
the
relative
risk
for
developing
acute
renal
failure
during
therapy
ranges
from
8
to
10
and
that
the
attributable
risk
is
70
%
to
80
%
.

Further
analysis
of
these
data
suggests
that
the
duration
of
therapy
,
plasma
aminoglycoside
levels
,
liver
disease
,
advanced
age
,
high
initial
estimated
creatinine
clearance
and
,
possibly
,
female
gender
all
increase
the
risk
for
nephrotoxicity
.

Other
causes
of
acute
renal
failure
,
such
as
shock
,
appear
to
have
an
additive
effect
.

Predictive
models
have
been
developed
from
these
analyses
that
should
be
useful
for
identifying
patients
at
high
risk
.

These
models
may
also
be
useful
in
developing
insights
into
the
pathophysiology
of
aminoglycoside

-induced

nephrotoxicity
.

Flurothyl
seizure
thresholds
in
mice
treated
neonatally
with
a
single
injection
of
monosodium
glutamate

(
MSG
):
evaluation
of
experimental
parameters
in
flurothyl
seizure
testing
.

Monosodium
glutamate
(
MSG
)
administration
to
neonatal
rodents
produces
convulsions
and
results
in
numerous
biochemical
and
behavioral
deficits
.

These
studies
were
undertaken
to
determine
if
neonatal
administration
of
MSG
produced
permanent
alterations
in
seizure
susceptibility
,
since
previous
investigations
were
inconclusive
.

A
flurothyl

ether
seizure

screening
technique
was
used
to
evaluate
seizure
susceptibility
in
adult
mice
that
received
neonatal
injections
of
MSG

(
4
mg
/
g
and
1
mg
/
g
)
.

MSG
treatment
resulted
in
significant
reductions
in
whole
brain
weight
but
did
not
alter
seizure
threshold
.

A
naloxone

(
5
mg
/
kg
)
challenge
was
also
ineffective
in
altering
the
seizure
thresholds
of
either
control
of
MSG
-treated
mice
.

Flurothyl

ether
produced

hypothermia
which
was
correlated
with
the
duration
of
flurothyl
exposure
;
however
,
the
relationship
of
hypothermia
to
seizure
induction
was
unclear
.

Flurothyl
seizure
testing
proved
to
be
a
rapid
and
reliable
technique
with
which
to
evaluate
seizure
susceptibility
.

Susceptibility
to
seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
in
rats
after
microinjection
of
isoniazid
or
gamma
-
vinyl
-
GABA
into
the
substantia
nigra
.

Pilocarpine
,
given
intraperitoneally
to
rats
,
reproduces
the
neuropathological
sequelae
of
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
and
provides
a
relevant
animal
model
for
studying
mechanisms
of
buildup
of
convulsive
activity
and
pathways
operative
in
the
generalization
and
propagation
of
seizures
within
the
forebrain
.

In
the
present
study
,
the
effects
of
manipulating
the
activity
of
the
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid

(
GABA
)
-mediated
synaptic
inhibition
within
the
substantia
nigra
on

seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
in
rats
,
were
investigated
.

In
animals
pretreated
with
microinjections
of
isoniazid
,
150
micrograms
,
an
inhibitor
of
activity
of
the
GABA
-synthesizing
enzyme
,
L
-
glutamic
acid
decarboxylase
,
into
the
substantia
nigra
pars
reticulata
(
SNR
)
,
bilaterally
,
non
-
convulsant
doses
of
pilocarpine
,
100
and
200
mg
/
kg
,
resulted
in
severe
motor
limbic
seizures
and
status
epilepticus
.

Electroencephalographic
and
behavioral
monitoring
revealed
a
profound
reduction
of
the
threshold
for
pilocarpine

-induced

convulsions
.

Morphological
analysis
of
frontal
forebrain
sections
with
light
microscopy
revealed
seizure

-related
damage
to
the
hippocampal
formation
,
thalamus
,
amygdala
,
olfactory
cortex
,
substantia
nigra
and
neocortex
,
which
is
typically
observed
with
pilocarpine
in
doses
exceeding
350
mg
/
kg
.

Bilateral
intrastriatal
injections
of
isoniazid
did
not
augment

seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
,
200
mg
/
kg
.

Application
of
an
irreversible
inhibitor
of
GABA
transaminase
,
gamma
-
vinyl
-
GABA

(
D
,
L-4-amino
-
hex-5-enoic
acid
)
,
5
micrograms
,
into
the
SNR
,
bilaterally
,
suppressed
the
appearance
of
electrographic
and
behavioral
seizures
produced
by
pilocarpine
,
380
mg
/
kg
.

This
treatment
was
also
sufficient
to
protect
animals
from
the
occurrence
of
brain
damage
.

Microinjections
of
gamma
-
vinyl
-
GABA
,
5
micrograms
,
into
the
dorsal
striatum
,
bilaterally
,
failed
to
prevent
the
development
of
convulsions
produced
by
pilocarpine
,
380
mg
/
kg
.

The
results
demonstrate
that
the
threshold
for
pilocarpine
-induced
seizures
in
rats
is
subjected
to
the
regulation
of
the
GABA
-mediated
synaptic
inhibition
within
the
substantia

.

Non
-
invasive
detection
of
coronary
artery
disease
by
body
surface
electrocardiographic
mapping
after
dipyridamole
infusion
.

Electrocardiographic
changes
after
dipyridamole
infusion

(
0.568
mg
/
kg/4
min
)
were
studied
in
41
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
and
compared
with
those
after
submaximal
treadmill
exercise
by
use
of
the
body
surface
mapping
technique
.

Patients
were
divided
into
three
groups
;
19
patients
without
myocardial
infarction

(
non-
MI
group
)
,
14
with
anterior
infarction

(
ANT
-
MI
)
and
eight
with
inferior
infarction

(
INF
-
MI
)
.

Eighty
-
seven
unipolar
electrocardiograms
(
ECGs
)
distributed
over
the
entire
thoracic
surface
were
simultaneously
recorded
.

After

dipyridamole
,
ischemic
ST
-
segment
depression
(
0.05
mV
or
more
)
was
observed
in
84
%
of
the
non-
MI
group
,
29
%
of
the
ANT
-
MI
group
,
63
%
of
the
INF
-
MI
group
and
61
%
of
the
total
population
.

Exercise
-
induced
ST
depression
was
observed
in
84
%
of
the
non-
MI
group
,
43
%
of
the
ANT
-
MI
group
,
38
%
of
the
INF
-
MI
group
and
61
%
of
the
total
.

For
individual
patients
,
there
were
no
obvious
differences
between
the
body
surface
distribution
of
ST
depression
in
both
tests
.

The
increase
in
pressure
rate
product
after
dipyridamole
was
significantly
less
than
that
during
the
treadmill
exercise
.

The
data
suggest
that
the
dipyridamole
-induced
myocardial
ischemia
is
caused
by
the
inhomogenous
distribution
of
myocardial
blood
flow
.

We
conclude
that
the
dipyridamole
ECG
test
is
as
useful
as
the
exercise
ECG
test
for
the
assessment
of
coronary
artery
disease
.

Bradycardia
after
high
-
dose
intravenous
methylprednisolone
therapy
.

In
5
consecutive
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
who
received
intravenous
high
-
dose
methylprednisolone

(
MP
)
therapy
(
1
g
daily
for
2
or
3
consecutive
days
)
,
a
decline
in
pulse
rate
was
observed
,
most
pronounced
on
day
4
.

In
one
of
the
5
patients
the
bradycardia
was
associated
with
complaints
of
substernal
pressure
.

Reversal
to
normal
heart
rate
was
found
on
day
7
.

Electrocardiographic
registrations
showed
sinus
bradycardia
in
all
cases
.

No
significant
changes
in
plasma
concentrations
of
electrolytes
were
found
.

Careful
observation
of
patients
receiving
high
-
dose
MP
is
recommended
.

High
-
dose

MP
may
be
contraindicated
in
patients
with
known
heart
disease
.

Two
cases
of
downbeat
nystagmus
and
oscillopsia
associated
with
carbamazepine
.

Downbeat
nystagmus
is
often
associated
with
structural
lesions
at
the
craniocervical
junction
,
but
has
occasionally
been
reported
as
a
manifestation
of
metabolic
imbalance
or
drug
intoxication
.

We
recorded
the
eye
movements
of
two
patients
with
reversible
downbeat
nystagmus
related
to
carbamazepine
therapy
.

The
nystagmus
of
both
patients
resolved
after
reduction
of
the
serum
carbamazepine
levels
.

Neuroradiologic
investigations
including
magnetic
resonance
imaging
scans
in
both
patients
showed
no
evidence
of
intracranial
abnormality
.

In
patients
with
downbeat
nystagmus
who
are
taking
anticonvulsant
medications
,
consideration
should
be
given
to
reduction
in
dose
before
further
investigation
is
undertaken
.

Improvement
by
denopamine

(

)
of

pentobarbital

.

The
efficacy
of
denopamine
,
an
orally
active
beta
1-adrenoceptor
agonist
,
in
improving
cardiac
failure
was
assessed
in
dog
heart

.

Cardiac
functions
depressed
by
pentobarbital
(
118
+

/-

28
mg
;

such
that
cardiac
output
and
maximum
rate
of
rise
of
left
ventricular
pressure
(
LV
dP
/
dt

)
had
been
reduced
by
about
35
%
and
26
%
of
the
respective
controls
were
improved
by
denopamine

(
10
-
300
micrograms
)
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

With
100
micrograms
denopamine
,
almost
complete
restoration
of
cardiac
performance
was
attained
,
associated
with
a
slight
increase
in
heart
rate
.

No

arrhythmias
were
induced
by
these
doses
of
denopamine
.

The
results
warrant
clinical
trials
of
denopamine
in
the
treatment
of
cardiac
failure
.

Clonazepam
monotherapy
for
epilepsy
in
childhood
.

Sixty
patients
(
age
-
range
one
month
to
14
years
)
with
other
types
of
epilepsy
than

infantile
spasms
were
treated

,
respectively
.

Seizures
disappeared
in
71
%
of
the
patients
with
generalized

and
89
%
of

Improvement
of

was
noticed
in

%
of
diffuse

and
in

Postmarketing
study
of
timolol

hydrochlorothiazide
antihypertensive
therapy
.

A
postmarketing
surveillance
study
was
conducted
to
determine
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
a
fixed

ratio
combination
containing
10
mg
of
timolol
maleate
and
25
mg
of

,
administered
twice
daily
for
one
month
to
hypertensive
patients
.

Data
on
9,037
patients
were
collected
by
1,455
participating
physicians
.

Mean
systolic

decreased
25
mmHg

after
one
month
of
timolol

.

Age
,

,
and

appeared
to
have
no

on
the
decrease
in

.

The
antihypertensive

,
the
most

Salicylate

nephropathy
in
the
Gunn
rat
:
potential
role
of
prostaglandins
.

We
examined
the
potential
role
of
prostaglandins
in
the
development
of
analgesic
nephropathy
in
the
Gunn
strain
of
rat
.

The
homozygous
Gunn
rats
have
unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia
due
to
the
absence
of
glucuronyl
transferase
,
leading
to
marked
bilirubin
deposition
in
renal
medulla
and
papilla
.

These
rats
are
also
highly
susceptible
to
develop
papillary
necrosis
with
analgesic
administration
.

We
used
homozygous
(
jj
)
and
phenotypically
normal
heterozygous
(
jJ
)
animals
.

Four
groups
of
rats
(
n
=
7
)
were
studied
:
jj
and
jJ
rats
treated
either
with
aspirin
300
mg
/
kg
every
other
day
or
sham
-
treated
.

After
one
week
,
slices
of
cortex
,
outer
and
inner
medulla
from
one
kidney
were
incubated
in
buffer
and
prostaglandin
synthesis
was
determined
by
radioimmunoassay
.

The
other
kidney
was
examined
histologically
.

A
marked
corticomedullary
gradient
of
prostaglandin
synthesis
was
observed
in
all
groups
.

PGE2
synthesis
was
significantly
higher
in
outer
medulla
,
but
not
cortex
or
inner
medulla
,
of
jj
(
38
+
/-
6
ng
/
mg
prot
)
than
jJ
rats
(
15
+
/-
3
)
(
p
less
than
0.01
)
.

Aspirin
treatment
reduced
PGE2
synthesis
in
all
regions
,
but
outer
medullary
PGE2
remained
higher
in
jj
(
18
+
/-
3
)
than
jJ
rats
(
9
+
/-
2
)
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
.

PGF2
alpha
was
also
significantly
higher
in
the
outer
medulla
of
jj
rats
with
and
without
aspirin
administration
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
.

The
changes
in
renal
prostaglandin
synthesis
were
accompanied
by
evidence
of
renal
damage
in
aspirin
-treated
jj
but
not
jJ
rats
as
evidenced
by
:
increased
incidence
and
severity
of
hematuria

(
p
less
than
0.01
)
;
increased
serum
creatinine

(
p
less
than
0.05
)
;
and
increase
in
outer
medullary
histopathologic
lesions
(
p
less
than
0.005
compared
to
either
sham
-
treated
jj
or
aspirin
-treated
jJ
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
enhanced
prostaglandin
synthesis
contributes
to
maintenance
of
renal
function
and
morphological
integrity
,
and
that
inhibition
of
prostaglandin
synthesis
may
lead
to
pathological
renal
medullary
lesions
and
deterioration
of
renal
function
.

Prophylactic
lidocaine
in
the
early
phase
of
suspected
myocardial
infarction
.

Four
hundred
two
patients
with
suspected
myocardial
infarction
seen
within
6
hours
of
the
onset
of
symptoms
entered
a
double
-
blind
randomized
trial
of
lidocaine
vs
placebo
.

During
the
1
hour
after
administration
of
the
drug
the
incidence
of
ventricular
fibrillation
or
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
among
the
204
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
was
low
,
1.5
%
.

Lidocaine
,
given
in
a
300
mg
dose
intramuscularly
followed
by
100
mg
intravenously
,
did
not
prevent
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
,
although
there
was
a
significant
reduction
in
the
number
of
patients
with
warning
arrhythmias
between
15
and
45
minutes
after
the
administration
of
lidocaine

(
p
less
than
0.05
)
.

The
average
plasma
lidocaine
level
10
minutes
after
administration
for
patients
without
a
myocardial
infarction
was
significantly
higher
than
that
for
patients
with
an
acute
infarction
.

The
mean
plasma

lidocaine
level
of
patients
on
beta
-
blocking
agents
was
no
different
from
that
in
patients
not
on
beta
blocking
agents
.

During
the
1-hour
study
period
,
the
incidence
of
central
nervous
system
side
effects
was
significantly
greater
in
the
lidocaine
group
,
hypotension
occurred
in
11
patients
,
nine
of
whom
had
received
lidocaine
,
and
four
patients
died
from
asystole
,
three
of
whom
had
had
lidocaine
.

We
can
not
advocate
the
administration
of
lidocaine
prophylactically
in
the
early
hours
of
suspected
myocardial
infarction
.

Evidence
for
a
cholinergic
role
in
haloperidol

-induced

catalepsy
.

Experiments
in
mice
tested
previous
evidence
that
activation
of
cholinergic
systems
promotes
catalepsy
and
that
cholinergic
mechanisms
need
to
be
intact
for
full
expression
of
neuroleptic

-induced

catalepsy
.

Large
doses
of
the
cholinomimetic
,
pilocarpine
,
could
induce
catalepsy

when
peripheral
cholinergic
receptors
were
blocked
.

Low
doses
of
pilocarpine
caused
a
pronounced
enhancement
of
the
catalepsy
that
was
induced
by
the
dopaminergic
blocker
,
haloperidol
.

A
muscarinic
receptor
blocker
,
atropine
,
disrupted
haloperidol

-induced

catalepsy
.

Intracranial
injection
of
an
acetylcholine
-synthesis
inhibitor
,
hemicholinium
,
prevented
the
catalepsy
that
is
usually
induced
by
haloperidol
.

These
findings
suggest
the
hypothesis
that
the
catalepsy
that
is
produced
by
neuroleptics
such
as
haloperidol
is
actually
mediated
by
intrinsic
central
cholinergic
systems
.

Alternatively
,
activation
of
central
cholinergic
systems
could
promote
catalepsy
by
suppression
of
dopaminergic
systems
.

Cardiovascular
dysfunction
and
hypersensitivity
to
sodium
pentobarbital
induced
by
chronic
barium
chloride
ingestion
.

Barium
-supplemented
Long
-
Evans
hooded
rats
were
characterized
by
a
persistent
hypertension

that
was
evident
after
1
month
of
barium

(
100
micrograms
/
ml
mineral
fortified
water
)
treatment
.

Analysis
of
in
vivo
myocardial
excitability
,
contractility
,
and
metabolic
characteristics
at
16
months
revealed
other
significant
barium
-induced
disturbances
within
the
cardiovascular
system
.

The
most
distinctive
aspect
of
the
barium
effect
was
a
demonstrated
hypersensitivity
of
the
cardiovascular
system
to
sodium
pentobarbital
.

Under
barbiturate
anesthesia
,
virtually
all
of
the
myocardial
contractile
indices
were
depressed
significantly
in
barium
-exposed
rats
relative
to
the
corresponding
control
-
fed
rats
.

The
lack
of
a
similar
response
to
ketamine
and
xylazine
anesthesia
revealed
that
the
cardiovascular
actions
of
sodium
pentobarbital
in
barium

-treated
rats
were
linked
specifically
to
this
anesthetic
,
and
were
not
representative
of
a
generalized
anesthetic
response
.

Other
myocardial
pathophysiologic
and
metabolic
changes
induced
by
barium
were
manifest
,
irrespective
of
the
anesthetic
employed
.

The
contractile
element
shortening
velocity
of
the
cardiac
muscle
fibers
was
significantly
slower
in
both
groups
of
barium

-treated
rats
relative
to
the
control
groups
,
irrespective
of
the
anesthetic
regimen
.

Similarly
,
significant
disturbances
in
myocardial
energy
metabolism
were
detected
in
the
barium
-exposed
rats
which
were
consistent
with
the
reduced
contractile
element
shortening
velocity
.

In
addition
,
the
excitability
of
the
cardiac
conduction
system
was
depressed
preferentially
in
the
atrioventricular
nodal
region
of
hearts
from
barium
-exposed
rats
.

Overall
,
the
altered
cardiac
contractility
and
excitability
characteristics
,
the
myocardial
metabolic
disturbances
,
and
the
hypersensitivity
of
the
cardiovascular
system
to
sodium
pentobarbital
suggest
the
existence
of
a
heretofore
undescribed
cardiomyopathic
disorder
induced
by
chronic
barium
exposure
.

These
experimental
findings
represent
the
first
indication
that
life
-
long
barium
ingestion
may
have
significant
adverse
effects
on
the
mammalian
cardiovascular
system
.

Propranolol
antagonism
of
phenylpropanolamine

-induced
hypertension
.

Phenylpropanolamine
(
PPA
)
overdose
can
cause
severe
hypertension
,
intracerebral
hemorrhage
,
and
death
.

We
studied
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
propranolol
in
the
treatment
of
PPA
-induced
hypertension
.

Subjects
received
propranolol
either
by
mouth
for
48
hours
before
PPA
or
as
a
rapid
intravenous
infusion
after
PPA
.

PPA
,
75
mg
alone
,
increased
blood
pressure
(
31
+
/-

14
mm
Hg
systolic
,
20
+
/-

5
mm
Hg
diastolic
)
,
and
propranolol
pretreatment
antagonized
this
increase
(
12
+
/-

10
mm
Hg
systolic
,

10
+
/-

7
mm
Hg
diastolic
)
.

Intravenous
propranolol
after
PPA
also
decreased
blood
pressure
.

Left
ventricular
function
(
assessed
by
echocardiography
)
showed
that
PPA
increased
the
stroke
volume
30
%
(
from
62.5
+
/-
20.9
to
80.8
+
/-
22.4
ml
)
,
the
ejection
fraction
9
%
(
from
64
%
+
/-

10
%
to
70
%
+
/-

7
%
)
,
and
cardiac
output
14
%
(
from
3.6
+
/-
0.6
to
4.1
+
/-

1.0
L
/
min
)
.

Intravenous
propranolol
reversed
these
effects
.

Systemic
vascular
resistance
was
increased
by
PPA
28
%
(
from
1710
+
/-

200
to
2190
+
/-
700
dyne
X
sec
/
cm5
)
and
was
further
increased
by
propranolol
22
%
(
to
2660
+
/-

1200
dyne
X
sec
/
cm5
)
.

We
conclude
that
PPA
increases
blood
pressure
by
increasing
systemic
vascular
resistance
and
cardiac
output
,
and
that
propranolol
antagonizes
this
increase
by
reversing
the
effect
of
PPA
on
cardiac
output
.

That
propranolol
antagonizes
the
pressor
effect
of
PPA
is
in
contrast
to
the
interaction
in
which
propranolol
enhances
the
pressor
effect
of
norepinephrine
.

This
is
probably
because
PPA
has
less
beta
2
activity
than
does
norepinephrine
.

Mesangial
function
and
glomerular
sclerosis
in
rats
with
aminonucleoside
nephrosis
.

The
possible
relationship
between
mesangial
dysfunction
and
development
of
glomerular
sclerosis
was
studied
in
the
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)
model
.

Five
male
Wistar
rats
received
repeated
subcutaneous
PAN
injections
;
five
controls
received
saline
only
.

After
4
weeks
the
PAN
rats
were
severely
proteinuric

(
190
+
/-

80
mg/24
hr
)
,
and
all
rats
were
given
colloidal
carbon

(
CC
)
intravenously
.

At
5
months
glomerular
sclerosis
was
found
in
7.6
+
/-

3.4
%
of
the
glomeruli
of
PAN
rats
;
glomeruli
of
the
controls
were
normal
.

Glomeruli
of
PAN
rats
contained
significantly
more
CC
than
glomeruli
of
controls
.

Glomeruli
with
sclerosis

contained
significantly
more
CC
than
non
-
sclerotic
glomeruli
in
the
same
kidneys
.

CC
was
preferentially
localized
within
the
sclerotic
areas
of
the
affected
glomeruli
.

Since
mesangial
CC
clearance
from
the
mesangium
did
not
change
during
chronic
PAN
treatment
,
we
conclude
that
this
preferential
CC
localization
within
the
lesions
is
caused
by
an
increased
CC
uptake
shortly
after
injection
in
apparent
vulnerable
areas
where
sclerosis
will
develop
subsequently
.

Cluster
analysis
showed
a
random
distribution
of
lesions
in
the
PAN
glomeruli
in
concordance
with
the
random
localization
of
mesangial
areas
with
dysfunction
in
this
model
.

Similar
to
the
remnant
kidney
model
in
PAN
nephrosis

the
development
of
glomerular
sclerosis
may
be
related
to
"
mesangial
overloading
.

Relationship
between
nicotine
-induced
seizures
and
hippocampal
nicotinic
receptors
.

A
controversy
has
existed
for
several
years
concerning
the
physiological
relevance
of
the
nicotinic
receptor
measured
by
alpha
-
bungarotoxin
binding
.

Using
mice
derived
from
a
classical
F2
and
backcross
genetic
design
,
a
relationship
between
nicotine
-induced
seizures
and
alpha
-
bungarotoxin
nicotinic
receptor
concentration
was
found
.

Mice
sensitive
to
the
convulsant
effects
of
nicotine
had
greater
alpha
-
bungarotoxin
binding
in
the
hippocampus
than
seizure
insensitive
mice
.

The
binding
sites
from
seizure

sensitive
and
resistant
mice
were
equally
affected
by
treatment
with
dithiothreitol
,
trypsin
or
heat
.

Thus
it
appears
that
the
difference
between
seizure
sensitive
and
insensitive
animals
may
be
due
to
a
difference
in
hippocampal
nicotinic
receptor
concentration
as
measured
with
alpha
-
bungarotoxin
binding
.

The
role
of
p
-
aminophenol
in
acetaminophen

-induced

nephrotoxicity
:
effect
of
bis(p
-
nitrophenyl
)
phosphate
on
acetaminophen
and
p
-
aminophenol

nephrotoxicity
and
metabolism
in
Fischer
344
rats
.

Acetaminophen

(
APAP
)
produces
proximal
tubular
necrosis
in
Fischer
344
(
F344
)
rats
.

Recently
,
p
-
aminophenol
(
PAP
)
,
a
known
potent
nephrotoxicant
,
was
identified
as
a
metabolite
of
APAP
in
F344
rats
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
PAP
formation
is
a
requisite
step
in
APAP

-induced

nephrotoxicity
.

Therefore
,
the
effect
of
bis(p
-
nitrophenyl
)
phosphate

(
BNPP
)
,
an
acylamidase
inhibitor
,
on
APAP
and
PAP

nephrotoxicity
and
metabolism
was
determined
.

BNPP
(
1
to
8
mM
)
reduced
APAP

deacetylation
and
covalent
binding
in
F344
renal
cortical
homogenates
in
a
concentration
-
dependent
manner
.

Pretreatment
of
animals
with
BNPP
prior
to
APAP
or
PAP
administration
resulted
in
marked
reduction
of
APAP

(
900
mg
/
kg
)

nephrotoxicity
but
not
PAP
nephrotoxicity
.

This
result
was
not
due
to
altered
disposition
of
either
APAP
or
acetylated
metabolites
in
plasma
or
renal
cortical
and
hepatic
tissue
.

Rather
,
BNPP
pretreatment
reduced
the
fraction
of
APAP
excreted
as
PAP
by
64
and
75
%
after

APAP
doses
of
750
and
900
mg
/
kg
.

BNPP
did
not
alter
the
excretion
of
APAP
or
any
of
its
non
-
deacetylated
metabolites
nor
did
BNPP
alter
excretion
of
PAP
or
its
metabolites
after

PAP
doses
of
150
and
300
mg
/
kg
.

Therefore
,
the
BNPP
-induced
reduction
in
APAP
-induced

nephrotoxicity
appears
to
be
due
to
inhibition
of
APAP
deacetylation
.

It
is
concluded
that
PAP
formation
,
in
vivo
,
accounts
,
at
least
in
part
,
for
APAP

-induced

renal
tubular
necrosis
.

Morphine
-induced
seizures
in
newborn
infants
.

Two
neonates
suffered
from
generalized
seizures
during
the
course
of
intravenous
morphine
sulfate
for
post
-
operative
analgesia
.

They
received
morphine
in
doses
of
32
micrograms
/
kg
/
hr
and
40
micrograms

/
kg
/

hr
larger
than
a
group
of
10
neonates
who
received
6
-
24
micrograms
/
kg
/
hr
and
had
no
seizures
.

Plasma
concentrations
of
morphine
in
these
neonates
was
excessive
(
60
and
90
mg
/
ml
)
.

Other
known
reasons
for
seizures
were
ruled
out
and
the
convulsions
stopped
a
few
hours
after
cessation
of
morphine
and
did
not
reoccur
in
the
subsequent

Effect
of
vincristine
sulfate
on
Pseudomonas
infections
in
monkeys
.

In
rhesus
monkeys
,
intravenous
challenge
with
0.6
x
10(10
)
to
2.2
x
10(10)Pseudomonas

organisms
caused
acute
illness
of
4
to
5
days
'
duration
with
spontaneous
recovery
in
13
of
15
monkeys
;
blood
cultures
became
negative
3
to
17
days
after
challenge
.

Leukocytosis
was
observed
in
all
monkeys
.

Intravenous
or
intratracheal
inoculation
of
2.0
to
2.5
mg
of
vincristine
sulfate
was
followed
by
leukopenia
in
4
to

days
.

resulted
in
fatal
infection
in
11
of
14
monkeys
,
whereas
none
of
four
receiving
Pseudomonas
alone
died
.

These
studies
suggest
that
an
antimetabolite
-
induced
leukopenia
predisposes
to
severe
Pseudomonas
sepsis
and
that
such
monkeys
may
serve
as
a
biological

for

of

agents
.

Central
excitatory
actions
of
flurazepam
.

Toxic
actions
of
flurazepam

(
FZP
)
were
studied
in
cats
,
mice
and
rats
.

High
doses
caused
an
apparent
central
excitation
,
most
clearly
seen
as
clonic
convulsions
,
superimposed
on
general
depression
.

Following
a
lethal
dose
,
death
was
always
associated
with
convulsions
.

Comparing
the
relative
sensitivity
to
central
depression
and
excitation
revealed
that
rats
were
least
likely
to
have
convulsions
at
doses
that
did
not
first
cause
loss
of
consciousness
,
while
cats
most
clearly
showed
marked
central
excitatory
actions
.

Signs
of
FZP
toxocity
in
cats
included
excessive
salivation
,
extreme
apprehensive
behavior
,
retching
,
muscle
tremors
and
convulsions
.

An
interaction
between
FZP
and
pentylenetetrazol

(
PTZ
)
was
shown
by
pretreating
mice
with
FZP
before
PTZ
challenge
.

As
a
function
of
dose
,
FZP
first
protected
against
convulsions
and
death
.

At
higher
doses
,
however
,
convulsions
again
emerged
.

These
doses
of
FZP
were
lower
than
those
that
would
alone
cause
convulsions
.

These
results
may
be
relevant
to
the
use
of
FZP
in
clinical
situations
in
which
there
is
increased
neural
excitability
,
such
as
epilepsy
or
sedative
-
hypnotic
drug
withdrawal
.

Evidence
for
cardiac
beta
2-adrenoceptors
in
man
.

We
compared
the
effects
of
single
doses
of
50
mg
atenolol

(
cardioselective
)
,
40
mg
propranolol
(
nonselective
)
,
and
placebo
on
both
exercise-
and

isoproterenol
-induced

tachycardia
in
two
experiments
involving
nine
normal
subjects
.

Maximal
exercise
heart
rate
was
reduced
from
187
+
/-

4(SEM

)
after
placebo
to
146
+
/-

7
bpm
after
atenolol
and
138

+
/-

6
bpm
after
propranolol
,
but
there
were
no
differences
between
the
drugs
.

The
effects
on
isoproterenol

tachycardia
were
determined
before
and
after
atropine

(
0.04
mg
/
kg
IV
)
.

Isoproterenol
sensitivity
was
determined
as
the
intravenous
dose
that
increased
heart
rate
by
25
bpm
(
CD25
)
and
this
was
increased
from
1.8
+
/-
0.3
micrograms
after
placebo
to
38.9
+
/-

8.3
micrograms
after
propranolol
and
8.3
+
/-

1.7
micrograms
after
atenolol
.

The
difference
in
the
effects
of
the
two
was
significant
.

After
atropine
the
CD25
was
unchanged
after
placebo
(
2.3
+
/-

0.3
micrograms
)
and
atenolol
(
7.7
+
/-

1.3
micrograms
)
;
it
was
reduced
after
propranolol
(
24.8
+
/-

5.0
micrograms
)
,
but
remained
different
from
atenolol
.

This
change
with
propranolol
sensitivity
was
calculated
as
the
apparent
Ka
,
this
was
unchanged
by
atropine
(
11.7
+

/-
2.1
and
10.1
+
/-

2.5
ml
/
ng
)
.

These
data
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
exercise
-
induced
tachycardia
results
largely
from
beta
1-receptor
activation
that
is
blocked
by
both
cardioselective
and
nonselective
drugs
,
whereas
isoproterenol
activates
both
beta
1-
and
beta

2-receptors

so
that
after
cardioselective
blockade
there
remains
a
beta
2-component
that
can
be
blocked
with
a
nonselective
drug
.

While
there
appear
to
be
beta
2-receptors
in
the
human
heart
,
their
physiologic
or
pathologic
roles
remain
to
be
defined
.

Hormones
and
risk
of
breast
cancer
.

This
paper
reports
the
results
of
a
study
of
50
menopausal
women
receiving
hormonal
replacement
therapy
.

The
majority
(
29
)
had
surgical
menopause
;
their
mean
age
was
45.7
years
.

It
was
hypothesized
that
progestins
could
equilibrate
the
effects
of
the
estrogenic
stimulation
on
the
mammary
and
endometrial
target
tissues
of
women
on
hormonal
replacement
therapy
.

The
treatment
schedule
consisted
of
conjugated
estrogens

(
Premarin
)
1.25
mg
/
day
for
21
days
and

Medroxyprogesterone
acetate
10
mg
/
day
for
10
days
in
each
month
.

The
mean
treatment
period
was
18
months
.

During
the
follow
-
up
period
,
attention
was
paid
to
breast
modifications
as
evidenced
by
symptomatology
,
physical
examination
,
and
plate
thermography
.

Mastodynia
was
reported
by
21
patients
,
and
physical
examination
revealed
a
light
increase
in
breast
firmness
in
12
women
and
a
moderate
increase
in
breast
nodularity
in
2
women
.

Themography
confirmed
the
existence
of
an
excessive
breast
stimulation
in
1
women
who
complained
of
moderate
mastodynia
and
in
5
of
the
7
women
who
complained
of
severe
mastodynia
.

Normalization
was
obtained
by
halving
the
estrogen
dose
.

These
results
suggest
that
hormonal
replacement
therapy
can
be
safely
prescribed
if
the
following
criteria
are
satisfied
:
1
)
preliminary
evaluation
of
patients
from
a
clinical
,
metabolic
,
cytologic
,
and
mammographic
perspective
;
2
)
cyclic
treatment
schedule
,
with
a
progestative
phase
of
10
days
;
and

,
with
accurate
thermographic
evaluation
of

Early
infections
in
kidney
,
heart
,
and
liver
transplant
recipients
on
cyclosporine
.

Eighty
-
one
renal
,
seventeen
heart
,
and
twenty
-
four
liver
transplant
patients
were
followed
for
infection
.

Seventeen
renal
patients
received
azathioprine

(
Aza
)
and
prednisone
as
part
of
a
randomized
trial
of
immunosuppression
with
21
cyclosporine

-and-
prednisone
-treated
renal
transplant
patients
.

All
others
received
cyclosporine
and
prednisone
.

The
randomized
Aza
patients
had
more
overall
infections

(
P
less
than
0.05
)
and
more
nonviral
infections

(
P
less
than
0.02
)
than
the
randomized
cyclosporine
patients
.

Heart
and
liver
patients
had
more
infections
than
cyclosporine
renal
patients
but
fewer
infections
than
the
Aza
renal
patients
.

There
were
no
infectious
deaths
in
renal
transplant
patients
on
cyclosporine
or
Aza
,
but
infection
played
a
major
role
in
3
out
of
6
cardiac
transplant
deaths
and
in
8
out
of
9
liver
transplant
deaths
.

Renal
patients
on
cyclosporine
had
the
fewest
bacteremias
.

Analysis
of
site
of
infection
showed
a
preponderance
of
abdominal
infections
in
liver
patients
,
intrathoracic
infections
in
heart
patients
,
and
urinary
tract
infections
in
renal
patients
.

Pulmonary
infections
were
less
common
in

cyclosporine
-treated
renal
patients
than
in
Aza
-treated
patients
(
P
less
than
0.05
)
.

Aza
patients
had
significantly
more
staphylococcal
infections
than
all
other
transplant
groups
(
P
less
than
0.005
)
,
and
systemic
fungal
infections
occurred
only
in
the
liver
transplant
group
.

Cytomegalovirus
(
CMV
)
shedding
or
serological
rises
in
antibody
titer
,
or
both
occurred
in
78
%
of
cyclosporine
patients
and
76
%
of
Aza
patients
.

Of
the
cyclosporine
patients
,
15
%
had
symptoms
related
to
CMV
infection
.

Serological
evidence
for
Epstein
Barr
Virus
infection
was
found
in
20
%
of
65
cyclosporine
patients
studied
.

Three
had
associated
symptoms
,
and
one
developed
a
lymphoma

)
and
nonsulphated
cholecystokinin
octapeptide

(

)
enhanced
the
latency
of
seizures
induced
by
picrotoxin
in
mice
.

Experiments
with
N-
and
C
-
terminal
fragments
revealed
that
the
C
-
terminal
tetrapeptide
(
CCK-5
-
8
)
was
the
active
centre
of
the
CCK
octapeptide
molecule
.

The

(

)
showed
bell
-

,
with
the
greatest

for

CCK-8
-NS
.

The
peptide
CCK-5

had
weak
anticonvulsant
activity
in

to
the
octapeptides
,
3.2
mumol

of
the
peptides
tested
was
less
than
that
of
diazepam
.

Experiments
with
analogues

demonstrated
that
the
effectiveness
of
the
beta

alanyl
derivatives
of
CCK-5

were
enhanced
and
that
they
were
equipotent

Vasopressin
as
a
possible
contributor
to
hypertension
.

The
role
of
vasopressin
as
a
pressor
agent
to
the
hypertensive
process
was
examined
.

Vasopressin
plays
a
major
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
DOCA
-salt

hypertension
,
since
the
elevation
of
blood
pressure
was
not
substantial
in
the
rats
with
lithium
-treated
diabetes
insipidus
after
DOCA
-salt
treatment
.

Administration
of
DDAVP
which
has
antidiuretic
action
but
minimal
vasopressor
effect
failed
to
increase
blood
pressure
to
the
levels
observed
after
administration
of
AVP
.

Furthermore
,
the
pressor
action
of
vasopressin
appears
to
be
important
in
the
development
of
this
model
of
hypertension
,
since
the
enhanced
pressor
responsiveness
to
the
hormone
was
observed
in
the
initial
stage
of
hypertension
.

Increased
secretion
of
vasopressin
from
neurohypophysis
also
promotes
the
function
of
the
hormone
as
a
pathogenetic
factor
in
hypertension
.

An
unproportional
release
of
vasopressin
compared
to
plasma
osmolality
may
be
induced
by
the
absence
of
an
adjusting
control
of
angiotensin
II
forming
and
receptor
binding
capacity
for
sodium
balance
in
the
brain
.

However
,
the
role
of
vasopressin
remains
to
be
determined
in
human
essential
hypertension
.

Toxic
hepatitis
induced
by
disulfiram
in
a
non
-
alcoholic
.

A
reversible
toxic
liver
damage
was
observed
in
a
non
-
alcoholic
woman
treated
with
disulfiram
.

The
causative
relationship
was
proven
by
challenge
.

Atrial
thrombosis
involving
the
heart
of
F-344
rats
ingesting
quinacrine
hydrochloride
.

Quinacrine
hydrochloride
is
toxic
for
the
heart
of
F-344
rats
.

Rats
treated
with
500
ppm
quinacrine
hydrochloride
in
the
diet
all
developed
a
high
incidence
of
left
atrial
thrombosis
.

The
lesion
was
associated
with
cardiac
hypertrophy
and
dilatation
and
focal
myocardial
degeneration
.

Rats
died
from
cardiac
hypertrophy
with
severe
acute
and
chronic
congestion
of
the
lungs
,
liver
,
and
other
organs
.

Seventy
percent
of
rats
given
250
ppm
quinacrine
hydrochloride
and
1,000
ppm
sodium
nitrite
simultaneously
in
the
diet
had

thrombosis
of
the
atria
of
the
heart
,
while
untreated
control
rats
in
this
laboratory
did
not
have
atrial
thrombosis
.

Sodium
nitrite
in
combination
with
quinacrine
hydrochloride
appeared
to
have
no
additional
effect
.

Alternating
sinus
rhythm
and
intermittent
sinoatrial
block
induced
by
propranolol
.

Alternating
sinus
rhythm
and
intermittent
sinoatrial
(
S
-
A
)
block
was
observed
in
a
57-year
-
old
woman
,
under
treatment
for
angina
with
80
mg
propranolol
daily
.

The
electrocardiogram
showed
alternation
of
long
and
short
P
-
P
intervals
and
occasional
pauses
.

These
pauses
were
always
preceded
by
the
short
P
-
P
intervals
and
were
usually
followed
by
one
or
two
P
-
P
intervals
of
0.92
-
0.95
s
representing
the
basic
sinus
cycle
.

Following
these
basic
sinus
cycles
,
alternating
rhythm
started
with
the
longer
P
-
P
interval
.

The
long
P
-
P
intervals
ranged
between
1.04
-
1.12
s
and
the
short
P
-
P
intervals
between
0.80
-
0.84
s
,
respectively
.

The
duration
of
the
pauses
were
equal
or
almost
equal
to
one
short
plus
one
long
P
-
P
interval
or
to
twice
the
basic
sinus
cycle
.

In
one
recording
a
short
period
of
regular
sinus
rhythm
with
intermittent
2/1
S
-
A
block
was
observed
.

This
short
period
of
sinus
rhythm
was
interrupted
by
sudden
prolongation
of
the
P
-
P
interval
starting
the
alternative
rhythm
.

There
were
small
changes
in
the
shape
of
the
P
waves
and
P
-
R
intervals
.

S
-

A
conduction
through
two
pathways
,
the
first
with
2/1
block
the
second
having
0.12
-
0.14
s
longer
conduction
time
and
with
occasional
2/1
block
was
proposed
for
the
explanation
of
the
alternating
P
-
P
interval
and
other
electrocardiographic
features
seen
.

Atropine
1
mg
given
intravenously
resulted
in
shortening
of
all
P
-
P
intervals
without
changing
the
rhythm
.

The
abnormal
rhythm
disappeared
with
the
withdrawal
of
propranolol
and
when
the
drug
was
restarted
a
2/1
S
-
A
block
was
seen
.

This
was
accepted
as
evidence
for
propranolol
being
the
cause
of
this
conduction
disorder
.

.

Animals
with
a

mm
)
were
treated
with
iv
injections
of
doxorubicin
on
5
consecutive
days
,
followed
by

weekly
injection
for
7
weeks
(

)
.

Tumor
regression
was
observed
with
0.5
mg
doxorubicin
/kg
.

Complete
disappearance
of
the
tumor
was
induced
with
1.0
mg
doxorubicin
/kg
.

Histologic
evidence
of
cardiotoxicity
scored
as
grade
III
was
only
observed
at
a
dose
of
1.0
mg
doxorubicin
/kg
.

Light
microscopic
evidence
of
renal
damage
was
seen
above
a
dose
of
0.5
mg
doxorubicin
/kg
,
which
resulted
in
albuminuria
and
very
low
serum
albumin
levels
.

In
the
group
that
received
1.0
mg
doxorubicin
/kg
,
the
serum

level
decreased
from
33.6
+

4.1
to
1.5

.

Ascites
and
hydrothorax
were
observed
simultaneously
.

The
same
experiments
were
performed
with
non-
tumor

,
in
which
no
major
differences
were
observed
.

In

,
cardiotoxicity
,
and
nephrotoxicity
were
studied
simultaneously
in
the
same
LOU
/
M
/
WSL
rat
.

Albuminuria
due
to
renal
damage
led
to
extremely
low
serum
albumin
levels
,
so
ascites
and
hydrothorax
were
not
necessarily
a
consequence
of
the
observed
cardiomyopathy
.

Intraoperative
bradycardia
and
hypotension
associated
with
timolol
and
pilocarpine
eye
drops
.

A
69-yr
-
old
man
,
who
was
concurrently
being
treated
with
pilocarpine
nitrate
and
timolol
maleate
eye
drops
,
developed
a
bradycardia
and
became
hypotensive
during
halothane
anaesthesia
.

Both
timolol
and
pilocarpine
were
subsequently
identified
in
a
24-h
collection
of
urine
.

Timolol
(
but
not
pilocarpine
)
was
detected
in
a
sample
of
plasma
removed
during
surgery
;
the
plasma
concentration
of
timolol

(
2.6
ng
ml-1
)
was
consistent
with
partial
beta
-
adrenoceptor
blockade
.

It
is
postulated
that
this
action
may
have
been
enhanced
during
halothane
anaesthesia
with
resultant
bradycardia
and
hypotension
.

Pilocarpine
may
have
had
a
contributory
effect
.

Succinylcholine

apnoea
:
attempted
reversal
with
anticholinesterases
.

Anticholinesterases
were
administered
in
an
attempt
to
antagonize
prolonged
neuromuscular
blockade
following
the
administration
of
succinylcholine
in
a
patient
later
found
to
be
homozygous
for
atypical
plasma
cholinesterase
.

Edrophonium
10
mg
,
given
74
min
after
succinylcholine
,
when
train
-
of
-
four
stimulation
was
characteristic
of
phase
II
block
,
produced
partial
antagonism
which
was
not
sustained
.

Repeated
doses
of
edrophonium
to
70
mg
and
neostigmine
to
2.5
mg
did
not
antagonize
or
augment
the
block
.

Spontaneous
respiration
recommenced
200
min
after
succinylcholine
administration
.

It
is
concluded
that
anticholinesterases
are
only
partially
effective
in
restoring
neuromuscular
function
in
succinylcholine

apnoea
despite
muscle
twitch
activity
typical
of
phase
II
block
.

Effect
of
doxorubicin
on

[
omega
-
I-131]heptadecanoic
acid
myocardial
scintigraphy
and
echocardiography
in
dogs
.

The
effects
of
serial
treatment
with
doxorubicin
on
dynamic
myocardial
scintigraphy
with
[
omega
-
I-131]heptadecanoic
acid

(
I-131
HA
)
,
and
on
global
left
-
ventricular
function
determined
echocardiographically
,
were
studied
in
a
group
of
nine
mongrel
dogs
.

Total
extractable
myocardial
lipid
was
compared
postmortem
between
a
group
of
control
dogs
and
doxorubicin

-treated
dogs
.

A
significant
and
then
progressive
fall
in
global
LV
function
was
observed
at
a
cumulative
doxorubicin
dose
of
4
mg
/
kg
.

A
significant
increase
in
the
myocardial
t1/2
of
the
I-131
HA
was
observed
only
at
a
higher
cumulative
dose
,
10
mg
/
kg
.

No
significant
alteration
in
total
extractable
myocardial
lipids
was
observed
between
control
dogs
and
those
treated
with
doxorubicin
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
the
changes
leading
to
an
alteration
of
myocardial
dynamic
imaging
with
I-131
HA
are
not
the
initiating
factor
in
doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity
.

Hemodynamics
and
myocardial
metabolism
under
deliberate
hypotension
.

An
experimental
study
in
dogs
.

Coronary
blood
flow
,
cardiac
work
and
metabolism
were
studied
in
dogs
under
sodium
nitroprusside

(
SNP
)
and
trimetaphan

(
TMP
)
deliberate
hypotension
(
20
%
and
40
%
mean
pressure
decrease
from
baseline
)
.

Regarding
the
effects
of
drug
-
induced
hypotension
on
coronary
blood
flow
,
aortic
and
coronary
sinus
metabolic
data
(
pH
,
pO2
,
pCO2
)
we
could
confirm
that
nitroprusside

hypotension
could
be
safely
used
to
30
%
mean
blood
pressure
decrease
from
control
,
trimetaphan
hypotension
to
20
%
mean
blood
pressure
decrease
.

Cardiac
work
was
significantly
reduced
during
SNP
hypotension
.

Myocardial
O2

consumption
and
O2
availability
were
directly
dependent
on
the
coronary
perfusion
.

Careful
invasive
monitoring
of
the
blood
pressure
,
blood
gases
and
of
the
ECG
ST
-
T
segment
is
mandatory
.

Evidence
for
a
selective
brain
noradrenergic
involvement
in
the
locomotor
stimulant
effects
of
amphetamine
in
the
rat
.

Male
rats
received
the
noradrenaline
neurotoxin
DSP4
(
50
mg
/
kg
)
7
days
prior
to
injection
of
D
-
amphetamine

(
10
or
40
mumol
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

The
hyperactivity
induced
by
D
-
amphetamine

(
10
mumol
/
kg
)
was
significantly
reduced
by
DSP4
pretreatment
.

However
,
the
increased
rearings
and
the
amphetamine
-induced
stereotypies
were
not
blocked
by
pretreatment
with
DSP4
.

The
reduction
of
amphetamine
hyperactivity
induced
by
DSP4
was
blocked
by
pretreatment
with
the
noradrenaline
-uptake
blocking
agent
,
desipramine
,
which
prevents
the
neurotoxic
action
of
DSP4
.

The
present
results
suggest
a
selective
involvement
of
central
noradrenergic
neurones
in
the
locomotor
stimulant
effect
of
amphetamine
in
the
rat
.

Accelerated
junctional
rhythms
during
oral
verapamil
therapy
.

This
study
examined
the
frequency
of
atrioventricular
(
AV
)
dissociation
and
accelerated
junctional
rhythms
in
59
patients
receiving
oral
verapamil
.

Accelerated
junctional
rhythms
and
AV
dissociation
were
frequent
in
patients
with
supraventricular
tachyarrhythmias
,
particularly
AV
nodal
reentry
.

Verapamil
administration
to
these
patients
led
to
an
asymptomatic
increase
in
activity
of
these
junctional
pacemakers
.

In
patients
with
various
chest
pain
syndromes
,
verapamil
neither
increased
the
frequency
of
junctional
rhythms
nor
suppressed
their
role
as
escape
rhythms
under
physiologically
appropriate
circumstances
.

Treatment
of
ovarian
cancer
with
a
combination
of
cis
-
platinum
,
adriamycin
,
cyclophosphamide
and
hexamethylmelamine
.

During
the
last
2
1/2
years
,
38
patients
with
ovarian
cancer
were
treated
with
a
combination
of
cisplatinum

(
CPDD
)
,
50
mg
/
m2
,
adriamycin
,
30
mg
/
m2
,
cyclophosphamide
,
300
mg
/
m2
,
on
day
1
;
and
hexamethylmelamine
(
HMM
)
,
6
mg
/
kg
daily
,
for
14
days
.

Each
course
was
repeated
monthly
.

2
patients
had
stage
II
,
14
stage
III
and
22
stage
IV
disease
.

14
of
the
38
patients
were
previously
treated
with
chemotherapy
,
1
with
radiation
,
6
with
both
chemotherapy
and
radiation
,
and
17
did
not
have
any
treatment
before
CPDD
combination
.

31
of
the
38
cases
(
81.5
%
)
demonstrated
objective
responses
lasting
for
2
months
or
more
.

These
responses
were
partial
in
19
and
complete
in
12
cases
.

Hematologic
toxicity
was
moderate
and
with
reversible
anemia
developing
in
71
%
of
patients
.

Gastrointestinal
side
effects
from
CPDD
were
universal
.

HMM
gastrointestinal
toxicity

necessitated
discontinuation
of
the
drug
in
5
patients
.

Severe
nephrotoxicity
was
observed
in
2
patients
but
was
reversible
.

There
were
no
drug
-
related
deaths
.

Nontraumatic
dissecting

of
the
basilar

.

A
case
of
nontraumatic
dissecting
aneurysm
of
the
basilar
artery
in
association
with
hypertension
,
smoke
,
and
oral
contraceptives
is
reported
in
a
young
female

.

Propylthiouracil
-induced
hepatic
damage
.

Two
cases
of
propylthiouracil
-induced
liver
damage
have
been
observed
.

The
first
case
is
of
an
acute
type
of
damage
,
proven
by
rechallenge
;
the
second
presents
a
clinical
and
histologic
picture
resembling
chronic

Studies
on
the
bradycardia
induced
by
bepridil
.

Bepridil
,
a
novel
active
compound
for
prophylactic
treatment
of
anginal
attacks
,
induced
persistent
bradycardia
and
a
non
-
specific
anti-
tachycardial
effect
,
the
mechanisms
of
which
were
investigated
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

In
vitro
perfusion
of
bepridil
in
the
life
-
support
medium
for
isolated
sino
-
atrial
tissue
from
rabbit
heart
,
caused
a
reduction
in
action
potential
(
AP
)
spike
frequency
(
recorded
by
KCl
microelectrodes
)
starting
at
doses
of
5
X
10(-6
)

M.

This
effect
was
dose
-
dependent
up
to
concentrations
of
5
X
10(-5

)
M
,
whereupon
blockade
of
sinus
activity
set
in
.

Bepridil
at
a
dose
of
5
X
10(-6
)

M
,
induced
a
concomitant
reduction
in
AP
amplitude
(
falling
from
71
+
/-

8
mV
to
47
+
/-

6
mV
)
,
maximum
systolic
depolarization
velocity
(
phase
0
)
which
fell
from
1.85
+
/-
0.35
V

/
s
to
0.84
+
/-

0.28
V
/
s
,
together
with
maximum
diastolic
depolarization
velocity
(
phase
4
)
which
fell
from
38
+
/-

3
mV
/
s
to
24
+
/-

5
mV
/
s
.

In
vivo
injection
of
bepridil
at
a
dose
of
5
mg
/
kg
(
i.v
.
)

into
6
anaesthetized
dogs
which
had
undergone
ablation
of
all
the
extrinsic
cardiac
afferent
nerve
supply
,
together
with
a
bilateral
medullo
-
adrenalectomy
,
caused
a
marked
reduction
in
heart
rate
which
fell
from
98.7
+
/-

4.2
beats
/
min
to
76
+
/-

5.3
beats
/
min
sustained
for
more
than
45
min
.

It
is
concluded
that
bepridil
reduces
heart
rate
by
acting
directly
on
the
sinus
node
.

This
effect
,
which
results
in
a
flattening
of
the
phase
0
and
phase
4
slope
,
together
with
a
longer
AP
duration
,
may
be
due
to
an
increase
in
the
time
constants
of
slow
inward
ionic
currents
(
already
demonstrated
elsewhere
)
,
but
also
to
an
increased
time
constant
for
deactivation
of
the
outward
potassium
current
(
Ip
)
.

Hepatitis
and
renal
tubular
acidosis
after
anesthesia
with
methoxyflurane
.

A
69-year
-
old
man
operated
for
acute
cholecystitis
under
methoxyflurane

anesthesia
developed
postoperatively
a
hepatic
insufficiency
syndrome
and
renal
tubular
acidosis
.

Massive
bleeding
appeared
during
surgery
which
lasted
for
six
hours
.

Postoperative
evolution
under
supportive
therapy
was
favourable
.

Complete
recovery
was
confirmed
by
repeated
controls
performed
over
a
period
of
one
year
after
surgery
.

Pituitary
response
to
luteinizing
hormone
-
releasing
hormone
during

haloperidol
-induced

hyperprolactinemia
.

The
effects
of
a
6-hour
infusion
with
haloperidol
on
serum
prolactin
and
luteinizing
hormone
(
LH
)
levels
was
studied
in
a
group
of
male
subjects
.

Five
hours
after
starting
the
infusions
,
a
study
of
the
pituitary
responses
to
LH
-
releasing
hormone
(
LH
-
RH
)
was
carried
out
.

Control
patients
received
infusions
of
0.9
%
NaCl
solution
.

During
the
course
of
haloperidol
infusions
,
significant
hyperprolactinemia
was
found
,
together
with
an
abolished
pituitary
response
to
LH
-
RH
,
as
compared
with
responses
of
control
subjects
.

Antirifampicin
antibodies
in
acute
rifampicin
-associated
renal
failure
.

5
patients
with
acute
renal
failure

(
3
with
thrombopenia
and
hemolysis
)
induced
by
the
reintroduction
of
rifampicin
are
described
.

No
correlation
was
found
between
the
severity
of
clinical
manifestations
and
the
total
dose
taken
by
the
patients
.

In
all
but
1
patient
,
antirifampicin
antibodies
were
detected
.

Antibodies
suggested
to
be
of
the
IgM
class
were
detected
in
all
3
patients
with
hematological
disorders
.

The
pattern
of
non
-
specific
acute
tubular
necrosis
found
in
the
2
biopsied
patients
,
indistinguishable
from
that
of
ischemic
origin
,
raised
the
possibility
of
a
vascular
-
mediated
damage
.

In
3
patients
,
the
possibility
of
a
triggering
immunoallergic
mechanism
is
discussed
.

Cardiovascular
effects
of
hypotension
induced
by
adenosine
triphosphate
and
sodium
nitroprusside
on
dogs
with
denervated
hearts
.

Adenosine
triphosphate
(
ATP
)
and
sodium
nitroprusside

(
SNP
)
are
administered
to
patients
to
induce
and
control
hypotension
during
anesthesia
.

SNP
is
authorized
for
clinical
use
in
USA
and
UK
,
and
ATP
is
clinically
used
in
other
countries
such
as
Japan
.

We
investigated
how
these
two
drugs
act
on
the
cardiovascular
systems
of
20
dogs
whose
hearts
had
been
denervated
by
a
procedure
we
had
devised
.

ATP
(
10
dogs
)
or
SNP
(
10
dogs
)
was
administered
to
reduce
mean
arterial
pressure
by
30
%
to
70
%
of
control
.

Before
,
during
and
after
induced
hypotension
,
we
measured
major
cardiovascular
parameters
.

Hypotension
induced
by
ATP
was
accompanied
by
significant
decreases
in
mean
pulmonary
arterial
pressure
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
central
venous
pressure
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
pressure
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
total
peripheral

(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
rate
pressure
product
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
total
body
oxygen
consumption
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
,
and
heart
rate
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
;
all
these
variables
returned
normal
within
30
min
after
ATP
was
stopped
.

Cardiac
output
did
not
change
.

During
hypotension
produced
by
SNP
similar
decreases
were
observed
in
mean
pulmonary
arterial
pressure
(
p
less
than
0.01
)
,
central
venous
pressure
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
pressure
(
p
less
than
0.01
)
,
total
peripheral
resistance
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
rate
pressure
product
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
,
and
oxygen
content
difference
between
arterial
and
mixed
venous
blood
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
,
while
heart
rate
(
p
less
than
0.001
)
and
cardiac
output
(
p
less
than
0.05
)
were
increased
.

Recoveries
of
heart
rate
and
left
ventricular
end
-
diastolic
pressure
were
not
shown
within
60
min
after
SNP
had
been
stopped
.

Both
ATP
and
SNP
should
act
on
the
pacemaker
tissue
of
the
heart
.

Comparative
study
:
Endografine

(
diatrizoate
)
,
Vasurix
polyvidone

(
acetrizoate
)
,
Dimer
-
X

(
iocarmate
)
and
Hexabrix

(
ioxaglate
)
in
hysterosalpingography
.

Side
effects
of
hysterosalpingography
with
Dimer
-
X
,
Hexabrix
,
Vasurix
polyvidone
and
Endografine
in
142
consecutive
patients
,
receiving
one
of
the
four
tested
media
were
evaluated
from
replies
to
postal
questionnaires
.

The
Dimer
-
X
group
had
a
higher
incidence
of
nausea
and
dizziness
.

The
Endografine
group
had
a
higher
incidence
of
abdominal
pain
.

These
differences
occur
especially
in
the
age
groups
under
30
years
.

Hexabrix
and
Vasurix
polyvidone
are
considered
the
best
contrast
media
for
hysterosalpingography
and
perhaps
because
of
its
low
toxicity
Hexabrix
should
be
preferred
.

Post-
suxamethonium
pains
in
Nigerian
surgical
patients
.

Contrary
to
an
earlier
report
by
Coxon
,
scoline

pain
occurs
in
African
negroes
.

Its
incidence
was
determined
in
a
prospective
study
involving
a
total
of
100
Nigerian
patients
(
50
out
-
patients
and
50
in
-
patients
)
.

About
62
%
of
the
out
-
patients
developed
scoline

pain
as
compared
with
about
26
%
among
the
in
-
patients
.

The
abolition
of
muscle
fasciculations
(
by
0.075mg
/
kg
dose
of
Fazadinium
)
did
not
influence
the
occurrence
of
scoline
pain
.

Neither
the
type
of
induction
agent
(
Althesin
or
Thiopentone
)
nor
the
salt
preparation
of
suxamethonium
used
(
chloride
or
bromide
)
,
affected
the
incidence
of
scoline
pain
.

Medial

.

In
normal
rats
,
the
media
of
small

(
0.4
-
-0.2
mm
in
diameter
)
previously
was
shown
to
contain
intracellular
vacuoles
,
identified
ultrastructurally
as
herniations
of

cell
into
another
.

The
hypothesis
that
intense
vasoconstriction
would
increase
the
number
of
such
vacuoles
has
been
tested
.

In
the
media
of
the
saphenous
artery
and
its
distal
branch
,
vasoconstriction
induced
by
L
-
norepinephrine
produced
many
cell
-
to
-
cell
hernias
within
15
minutes
.

At
1
day
their
number
was
reduced
to
about
1/10
of
the
original
number
.

By
7
days
the
vessel
was
almost
restored
to
normal
.

Triple
stimulation
over
1
day
induced
more
severe
changes
in
the
media
.

These
findings
suggest
that
smooth
muscle
cells
are
susceptible
to
damage
in
the
course
of
their
specific
function
.

The
experimental
data
are
discussed
in
relation
to
medial
changes
observed
in
other
instances
of
arterial
spasm
.

Endothelial
changes
that
developed
in
the
same
experimental
model
were
described
in
a
previous
paper
.

Abnormalities
of
the

developed
in
a
54-year

old
man
after
the
use
of

.

He
later
recovered
normal

.

A
transient

response
,
denervation
supersensitivity

,
to
our

,
have
not
been
previously
reported
.

Suxamethonium
-induced
jaw
stiffness
and
myalgia
associated
with
atypical
cholinesterase
:
case
report
.

An
11-year
-
old
boy
was
given
halothane
,
nitrous
oxide
and
oxygen
,
pancuronium
0.4
mg
and

suxamethonium
100
mg
for
induction
of
anaesthesia
.

In
response
to
this
a
marked
jaw
stiffness
occurred
which
lasted
for
two
minutes
and
the
anaesthesia
were
terminated
.

Four
hours
of
apnoea
ensued
and
he
suffered
generalized
severe
myalgia
lasting
for
one
week
.

He
was
found
to
have
atypical
plasma
cholinesterase
with
a
dibucaine
number
of
12
,
indicating
homozygocity
.

This
was
verified
by
study
of
the
family
.

The
case
shows
that
prolonged
jaw
rigidity
and
myalgia
may
occur
after
suxamethonium
in
patients
with
atypical
cholinesterase
despite
pretreatment
with
pancuronium
.

Indomethacin
-induced
hyperkalemia
in
three
patients
with
gouty
arthritis
.

We
describe
three
patients
in
whom
severe
,
life
-
threatening
hyperkalemia
and
renal
insufficiency
developed
after
treatment
of
acute
gouty
arthritis
with
indomethacin
.

This
complication
may
result
from
an
inhibition
of
prostaglandin
synthesis
and
consequent
hyporeninemic
hypoaidosteronism
.

Careful
attention
to
renal
function
and
potassium
balance
in
patients
receiving
indomethacin
or
other
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
agents
,
particularly
in
those
patients
with
diabetes
mellitus
or
preexisting
renal
disease
,
will
help
prevent
this
potentially
serious
complication
.

Etomidate
:
a
foreshortened
clinical
trial
.

A
clinical
evaluation
of
etomidate
for
outpatient
cystoscopy
was
embarked
upon
.

Unpremedicated
patients
were
given
fentanyl
1
microgram
/
kg
followed
by
etomidate
0.3
mg
/
kg
.

Anaesthesia
was
maintained
with
intermittent
etomidate
in
2
-
4
mg
doses
.

Patients
were
interviewed
personally
later
the
same
day
,
and
by
questionnaire
three
to
four
weeks
later
.

The
trial
was
discontinued
after
20
cases
because
of
an
unacceptable
incidence
of
side
effects
.

Venous
pain
occurred
in
68
%
of
patients
and
50
%
had
redness
,
pain
or
swelling
related
to
the
injection
site
,
in
some
cases
lasting
up
to
three
weeks
after
anaesthesia
.

Skeletal
movements
occurred
in
50
%
of
patients
;
30
%
experienced

respiratory
upset
,
one
sufficiently
severe
to
necessitate
abandoning
the
technique
.

Nausea
and
vomiting
occurred
in
40
%
and
25
%
had
disturbing
emergence
psychoses
.

Levodopa
-induced

dyskinesias
are
improved
by
fluoxetine
.

We
evaluated
the
severity
of
motor
disability
and
dyskinesias
in
seven
levodopa
-responsive
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease
after
an
acute
challenge
with
the
mixed
dopamine
agonist
,
apomorphine
,
before
and
after
the
administration
of
fluoxetine

(
20
mg
twice
per
day
)
for
11
+
/-

1
days
.

After
fluoxetine
treatment
,
there
was
a
significant
47
%
improvement
(
p
0.05
)
of

apomorphine
-induced

dyskinesias
without
modification
of
parkinsonian
motor
disability
.

The
dyskinesias
were
reduced
predominantly
in
the
lower
limbs
during
the
onset
and
disappearance
of
dystonic
dyskinesias
(
onset-
and
end
-
of
-
dose
dyskinesias
)
and
in
the
upper
limbs
during
choreic
mid
-
dose
dyskinesias
.

The
results
suggest
that
increased
brain
serotoninergic
transmission
with
fluoxetine
may
reduce
levodopa
-
or
dopamine
agonist
-
induced
dyskinesias
without
aggravating
parkinsonian
motor
disability
.

A
large
population
-
based
follow
-
up
study
of
trimethoprim
-
sulfamethoxazole
,
trimethoprim
,
and
cephalexin
for
uncommon
serious
drug
toxicity
.

We
conducted
a
population
-
based
45-day
follow
-
up
study
of
232,390
people
who
were
prescribed
trimethoprim
-
sulfamethoxazole

(
TMP
-
SMZ
)
,
266,951
prescribed
trimethoprim
alone
,
and
196,397
prescribed
cephalexin
,
to
estimate
the
risk
of
serious
liver
,
blood
,
skin
,
and
renal
disorders
resulting
in
referral
or
hospitalization
associated
with
these
drugs
.

The
results
were
based
on
information
recorded
on
office
computers
by
selected
general
practitioners
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
together
with
a
review
of
clinical
records
.

The
risk
of
clinically
important
idiopathic
liver
disease
was
similar
for
persons
prescribed
TMP
-
SMZ

(
5.2/100,000
)
and
those
prescribed
trimethoprim
alone
(
3.8/100,000
)
.

The
risk
for
those
prescribed
cephalexin
was
somewhat
lower
(
2.0/100,000
)
.

Only
five
patients
experienced
blood
disorders
,
one
of
whom
was
exposed
to
TMP
-
SMZ
;
of
seven
with
erythema
multiforme
and
Stevens
-
Johnson
syndrome
,
four
were
exposed
to
TMP
-
SMZ
.

The
one
case
of
toxic
epidermal
necrolysis
occurred
in
a
patient
who
took
cephalexin
.

Finally
,
only
five
cases
of
acute
parenchymal
renal
disease
occurred
,
none
likely
to
be
caused
by
a
study
drug
.

We
conclude
that
the
risk
of
the
serious
diseases
studied
is
small
for
the
three
agents
,
and
compares
reasonably
with
the
risk
for
many
other
antibiotics
.

Clinical
safety
of
lidocaine
in
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

myocardial
infarction
.

STUDY
OBJECTIVE
:

To
evaluate
the
safety
of
lidocaine
in
the
setting
of
cocaine

-induced

myocardial
infarction

(
MI
)
.

DESIGN
:

A
retrospective
,
multicenter
study
.

SETTING
:

Twenty
-
nine
university
,
university
-
affiliated
,
or
community
hospitals
during
a
6-year
period
(
total
of
117
cumulative
hospital
-
years
)
.

PARTICIPANTS
:

Patients
with
cocaine

-associated

MI
who
received
lidocaine
in
the
emergency
department
.

RESULTS
:

Of
29
patients
who
received
lidocaine
in
the
setting
of
cocaine

-associated

MI
,
no
patient
died
;
exhibited
bradydysrhythmias
,
ventricular
tachycardia
,
or
ventricular
fibrillation
;
or
experienced
seizures
after
administration
of
lidocaine

(
95
%
confidence
interval
,
0
%
to
11
%
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

Despite
theoretical
concerns
that
lidocaine
may
enhance
cocaine
toxicity
,
the
use
of
lidocaine
in
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

MI
was
not
associated
with
significant
cardiovascular
or
central
nervous
system
toxicity
.

Paclitaxel
3-hour
infusion
given
alone
and
combined
with
carboplatin
:
preliminary
results
of
dose
-
escalation
trials
.

Paclitaxel

(
Taxol
;
Bristol
-
Myers
Squibb
Company
,
Princeton
,
NJ
)
by
3-hour
infusion
was
combined
with
carboplatin
in
a
phase
I
/
II
study
directed
to
patients
with
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
.

Carboplatin
was
given
at
a
fixed
target
area
under
the
concentration
-
time
curve
of
6.0
by
the
Calvert
formula
,
whereas
paclitaxel
was
escalated
in
patient
cohorts
from
150
mg
/
m2
(
dose
level
I
)
to
175
,
200
,
225
,
and
250
mg
/
m2
.

The
225
mg
/
m2
level
was
expanded
for
the
phase
II
study
since
the
highest
level
achieved
(
250
mg
/
m2
)
required
modification
because
of
nonhematologic
toxicities

(
arthralgia
and
sensory
neuropathy
)
.

Therapeutic
effects
were
noted
at
all
dose
levels
,
with
objective
responses
in
17
(
two
complete
and
15
partial
regressions
)
of
41
previously
untreated
patients
.

Toxicities
were
compared
with
a
cohort
of
patients
in
a
phase
I
trial
of
paclitaxel
alone
at
identical
dose
levels
.

Carboplatin
did
not
appear
to
add
to
the
hematologic
toxicities
observed
,
and
the
paclitaxel
/
carboplatin
combination
could
be
dosed
every
3
weeks
.

The
dose
-
dependent
effect
of
misoprostol
on
indomethacin
-induced

renal
dysfunction
in
well
compensated
cirrhosis
.

Misoprostol
(
200
micrograms
)
has
been
shown
to
acutely
counteract
the
indomethacin
-induced

renal
dysfunction
in
well
compensated
cirrhotic
patients
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
the
prophylactic
value
of
misoprostol
was
dose
-
dependent
.

Parameters
of
renal
hemodynamics
and
tubular
sodium
and
water
handling
were
assessed
by
clearance
techniques
in
26
well
compensated

cirrhotic
patients
before
and
after
an
oral
combination
of
50
mg
of
indomethacin
and
various
doses
of
misoprostol
.

The
200-micrograms
dose
was
able
to
totally
abolish
the
deleterious
renal
effects
of
indomethacin
,
whereas
the
800-micrograms
dose
resulted
in
significant
worsening
of
renal
hemodynamics
and
sodium
retention
.

These
changes
were
maximal
in
the
hour
immediately
after
medications
and
slowly
returned
toward
base
-
line
levels
thereafter
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
renal
protective
effects
of
misoprostol
is
dose
-
dependent
.

However
,
until
this
apparent
ability
of
200
micrograms
of
misoprostol
to
prevent
the
adverse
effects
of
indomethacin
on
renal
function
is
confirmed
with
chronic
frequent
dosing
,
it
would
be
prudent
to
avoid
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
therapy
in
patients
with
cirrhosis
.

Increased
frequency
and
severity
of
angio
-
oedema
related
to
long
-
term
therapy
with
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
inhibitor
in
two
patients
.

Adverse
reactions
to
drugs
are
well
recognized
as
a
cause
of
acute
or
chronic
urticaria
,
and
angio
-
oedema
.

Angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors
,
used
to
treat
hypertension
and
congestive
heart
failure
,
were
introduced
in
Europe
in
the
middle
of
the
eighties
,
and
the
use
of
these
drugs
has
increased
progressively
.

Soon
after
the
introduction
of
ACE
inhibitors
,
acute
bouts
of
angio
-
oedema
were
reported
in
association
with
the
use
of
these
drugs
.

We
wish
to
draw
attention
to
the
possibility
of
adverse
reactions
to
ACE
inhibitors
after
long
-
term
use
and
in
patients
with
pre
-
existing
angio
-
oedema
.

Myoclonus
associated
with
lorazepam
therapy
in
very
-
low
-
birth
-
weight
infants
.

Lorazepam
is
being
used
with
increasing
frequency
as
a
sedative
in
the
newborn
and
the
young
infant
.

Concern
has
been
raised
with
regard
to
the
safety
of
lorazepam
in
this
age
group
,
especially
in
very
-
low
-
birth
-
weight
(
VLBW
;
1,500
g
)
infants
.

Three
young
infants
,
all
of
birth
weight
1,500
g
,
experienced

myoclonus
following
the
intravenous
administration
of
lorazepam
.

The
potential

neurotoxic
effects
of
the
drug
(
and
its
vehicle
)
in
this
population
are
discussed
.

Injectable

lorazepam
should
be
used
with
caution
in
VLBW
infants
.

Transvenous
right
ventricular
pacing
during
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
of
pediatric
patients
with
acute
cardiomyopathy
.

We
describe
the
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
efforts
on
five
patients
who
presented
in
acute
circulatory
failure
from
myocardial
dysfunction
.

Three
patients
had
acute
viral
myocarditis
,
one
had
a
carbamazepine
-induced
acute
eosinophilic
myocarditis
,
and
one
had
cardiac
hemosiderosis
resulting
in
acute
cardiogenic
shock
.

All
patients
were
continuously
monitored
with
central
venous
and
arterial
catheters
in
addition
to
routine
noninvasive
monitoring
.

An
introducer
sheath
,
a
pacemaker
,
and
sterile
pacing
wires
were
made
readily
available
for
the
patients
,
should
the
need
arise
to
terminate
resistant
cardiac
dysrhythmias
.

All
patients
developed
cardiocirculatory
arrest
associated
with
extreme
hypotension
and
dysrhythmias
within
the
first
48
hours
of
their
admission
to
the
pediatric
intensive
care
unit
(
PICU
)
.

Right
ventricular
pacemaker
wires
were
inserted
in
all
of
them
during
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
(
CPR
)
.

In
four
patients
,
cardiac
pacing
was
used
,
resulting
in
a
temporary
captured
rhythm
and
restoration
of
their
cardiac
output
.

These
patients
had
a
second
event
of
cardiac
arrest
,
resulting
in
death
,
within
10
to
60
minutes
.

In
one
patient
,
cardiac
pacing
was
not
used
,
because
he
converted
to
normal
sinus
rhythm
by
electrical
defibrillation
within
three
minutes
of
initiating
CPR
.

We
conclude
that
cardiac
pacing
during
resuscitative
efforts
in
pediatric
patients
suffering
from
acute
myocardial
dysfunction
may
not
have
long
-
term
value
in
and
of
itself
;
however
,
if
temporary
hemodynamic
stability
is
achieved
by
this
procedure
,
it
may
provide
additional
time
needed
to
institute
other
therapeutic
modalities
.

Efficacy
and
safety
of
granisetron
,
a
selective
5-hydroxytryptamine
-3
receptor
antagonist
,
in
the
prevention
of
nausea
and
vomiting
induced
by
high
-
dose
cisplatin
.

PURPOSE
:
To
assess
the
antiemetic
effects
and
safety
profile
of
four
different
doses
of
granisetron

(
Kytril
;
SmithKline
Beecham
Pharmaceuticals
,
Philadelphia
,
PA
)
when
administered
as
a
single
intravenous
(
IV
)
dose
for
prophylaxis
of
cisplatin

-induced

nausea
and
vomiting
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

One
hundred
eighty
-
four
chemotherapy
-
naive
patients
receiving
high
-
dose
cisplatin
(
81
to
120
mg
/
m2
)
were
randomized
to
receive
one
of
four
granisetron
doses
(
5
,
10
,
20
,
or
40
micrograms
/
kg
)
administered
before
chemotherapy
.

Patients
were
observed
on
an
inpatient
basis
for
18
to
24
hours
,
and
vital
signs
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
retching
,
and
appetite
were
assessed
.

Safety
analyses
included
incidence
of
adverse
experiences
and
laboratory
parameter
changes
.

RESULTS
:

After
granisetron
doses
of
5
,
10
,
20
,
and
40
micrograms
/
kg
,
a
major
response
(
or
=
two
vomiting
or
retching
episodes
,
and
no
antiemetic
rescue
)
was
recorded
in
23
%
,
57
%
,
58
%
,
and
60
%
of
patients
,
respectively
,
and
a
complete
response
(
no
vomiting
or
retching
,
and
no
antiemetic
rescue
)
in
18
%
,
41
%
,
40
%
,
and
47
%
of
patients
,
respectively
.

There
was
a
statistically
longer
time
to
first
episode
of
nausea
(
P
=
.0015
)
and
vomiting

(
P
=
.0001
)
,
and
fewer
patients
were
administered
additional
antiemetic
medication
in
the
10-micrograms
/
kg
dosing
groups
than
in
the
5-micrograms
/
kg
dosing
group
.

As
granisetron
dose
increased
,
appetite
return
increased
(
P
=
.040
)
.

Headache
was
the
most
frequently
reported
adverse
event
(
20
%
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

A
single
10-
,
20-
,
or
40-micrograms
/
kg
dose
of

granisetron
was
effective
in
controlling
vomiting
in
57
%
to
60
%
of
patients
who
received
cisplatin
at
doses
greater
than
81
mg
/
m2
and
totally
prevented
vomiting
in
40
%
to
47

Adverse
interaction
between
clonidine
and
verapamil
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
two
cases
of
a
possible
adverse
interaction
between
clonidine
and
verapamil
resulting
in
atrioventricular
(
AV
)
block
in
both
patients
and
severe
hypotension
in
one
patient
.

CASE
SUMMARIES
:

A
54-year
-
old
woman
with
hyperaldosteronism
was
treated
with
verapamil

480
mg
/
d
and
spironolactone
100
mg
/
d
.

After
the
addition
of
a
minimal
dose
of
clonidine
(
0.15
mg
bid
)
,
she
developed
complete
AV
block
and
severe
hypotension
,
which
resolved
upon
cessation
of
all
medications
.

A
65-year
-
old
woman
was
treated
with
extended
-
release
verapamil
240
mg
/
d
.

After
the
addition
of
clonidine
0.15
mg
bid
she
developed
complete
AV
block
,
which
resolved
after
all
therapy
was
stopped
.

DISCUSSION
:

An
adverse
interaction
between
clonidine
and
verapamil
has
not
been
reported
previously
.

We
describe
two
such
cases
and
discuss
the
various
mechanisms
that
might
cause
such
an
interaction
.

Clinicians
should
be
acquainted
with
this
possibly
fatal
interaction
between
two
commonly
used
antihypertensive
drugs
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Caution
is
recommended
in
combining
clonidine
and
verapamil
therapy
,
even
in
patients
who
do
not
have
sinus
or
AV
node
dysfunction
.

The
two
drugs
may
act
synergistically
on
both
the
AV
node
and
the
peripheral
circulation
.

after
they
had
received
a
combination
dose
of
cocaine
and
diazepam
.

RESULTS
:

In
group
1
,
animals
received
cocaine
followed
by
vehicle
.

This
resulted
in
100
%
developing
seizures
and
death
.

Group
2
received
diazepam
alone
followed
by

.

Animals
became
somnolent
and
none
died
.

Group
3
received

diazepam

.

Animals
became
somnolent
after
diazepam
and
then
active
after
flumazenil
administration
.

In
group
4
,
a
combination
of
cocaine
and

.

Group
5
received
a
similar
combination
of
cocaine
and
diazepam
,
followed
later
by
5
mg

Mechanisms
for
protective
effects
of
free
radical
scavengers
on
gentamicin
-mediated
nephropathy
in
rats
.

Studies
were
performed
to
examine
the
mechanisms
for
the
protective
effects
of
free
radical
scavengers
on
gentamicin

(
GM
)
-mediated
nephropathy
.

Administration
of
GM
at
40
mg
/
kg
sc
for
13
days
to
rats
induced
a
significant
reduction
in
renal
blood
flow
(
RBF
)
and
inulin
clearance
(
CIn
)
as
well
as
marked
tubular
damage
.

A
significant
reduction
in
urinary
guanosine
3',5'-cyclic
monophosphate

(
cGMP
)
excretion
and
a
significant
increase
in
renal
cortical
renin
and
endothelin-1
contents
were
also
observed
in
GM
-mediated
nephropathy
.

Superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
or
dimethylthiourea

(
DMTU
)
significantly
lessened
the
GM
-induced
decrement
in
CIn
.

The
SOD
-
induced
increase
in
glomerular
filtration
rate
was
associated
with
a
marked
improvement
in
RBF
,
an
increase
in
urinary
cGMP
excretion
,
and
a
decrease
in
renal
renin
and
endothelin-1
content
.

SOD
did
not
attenuate
the
tubular
damage
.

In
contrast
,
DMTU
significantly
reduced
the
tubular
damage
and
lipid
peroxidation
,
but
it
did
not
affect
renal
hemodynamics
and
vasoactive
substances
.

Neither
SOD
nor
DMTU
affected
the
renal
cortical
GM
content
in
GM
-treated
rats
.

These
results
suggest
that
1
)
both
SOD
and
DMTU
have
protective
effects
on
GM

-mediated

nephropathy
,
2
)
the
mechanisms
for
the
protective
effects
differ
for

Assessment
of
cardiomyocyte
DNA
synthesis
during
hypertrophy
in
adult
mice
.

The
ability
of
cardiomyocytes
to
synthesize
DNA
in
response
to
experimentally
induced
cardiac
hypertrophy
was
assessed
in
adult
mice
.

Isoproterenol
delivered
by
osmotic
minipump
implantation
in
adult
C3Heb
/
FeJ
mice
resulted
in
a
46
%
increase
in
heart
weight
and
a
19.3
%
increase
in
cardiomyocyte
area
.

No
DNA
synthesis
,
as
assessed
by
autoradiographic
analysis
of
isolated
cardiomyocytes
,
was
observed
in
control
or
hypertrophic
hearts
.

A
survey
of
15
independent
inbred
strains
of
mice
revealed
that
ventricular
cardiomyocyte
nuclear
number
ranged
from
3
to
13
%
mononucleate
,
suggesting
that
cardiomyocyte
terminal
differentiation
is
influenced
directly
or
indirectly
by
genetic
background
.

To
determine
whether
the
capacity
for
reactive
DNA
synthesis
was
also
subject
to
genetic
regulation
,
cardiac
hypertrophy
was
induced
in
the
strains
of
mice
comprising
the
extremes
of
the
nuclear
number
survey
.

These
data
indicate
that
adult
mouse
atrial
and
ventricular
cardiomyocytes
do
not
synthesize
DNA
in
response
to
isoproterenol
-induced
cardiac
hypertrophy
.

Central
cardiovascular
effects
of
AVP
and
ANP
in
normotensive
and
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
compare
influence
of
central
arginine
vasopressin
(
AVP
)
and
of
atrial
natriuretic
peptide
(
ANP
)
on
control
of
arterial
blood
pressure
(
MAP
)
and
heart
rate
(
HR
)
in
normotensive
(
WKY
)
and
spontaneously
hypertensive
(
SHR
)
rats
.

Three
series
of
experiments
were
performed
on
30
WKY
and
30
SHR
,
chronically
instrumented
with
guide
tubes
in
the
lateral
ventricle
(
LV
)
and
arterial
and
venous
catheters
.

MAP
and
HR
were
monitored
before
and
after
i.v
.

injections
of
either
vehicle
or
1
,
10
and
50
ng
of
AVP
and
25
,
125
and
500
ng
of
ANP
.

Sensitivity
of
cardiac
component
of
baroreflex
(
CCB
)
,
expressed
as
a
slope
of
the
regression
line
was
determined
from
relationships
between
systolic
arterial
pressure
(
SAP
)
and
HR
period
(
HRp
)
during
phenylephrine

(
Phe
)
-induced

hypertension
and
sodium
nitroprusside

(
SN
)
-induced
hypotension
.

CCB
was
measured
before
and
after
administration
of
either
vehicle
,
AVP
,
ANP
,
or
both
peptides
together
.

Increases
of
MAP
occurred
after
LV
administration
of
1
,
10
and
50
ng
of
AVP
in
WKY
and
of
10
and
50
ng
in
SHR
.

ANP
did
not
cause
significant
changes
in
MAP
in
both
strains
as
compared
to
vehicle
,
but
it
abolished
AVP
-induced
MAP
increase
in
WKY
and
SHR
.

CCB
was
reduced
in
WKY
and
SHR
after
LV
administration
of
AVP
during
SN
-induced
hypotension
.

In
SHR
but
not
in
WKY
administration
of
ANP
,
AVP
and
ANP
+
AVP
decreased
CCB
during
Phe
-induced
MAP
elevation
.

The
results
indicate
that
centrally
applied
AVP
and
ANP
exert
differential
effects
on
blood
pressure
and
baroreflex
control
of
heart
rate
in
WKY
and
SHR
and
suggest
interaction
of
these
two
peptides
in
blood
pressure
regulation
at
the
level
of
central
nervous
system
.

Cutaneous
exposure
to
warfarin

-like
anticoagulant
causing
an
intracerebral
hemorrhage
:
a
case
report
.

A
case
of
intercerebral
hematoma
due
to
warfarin
-induced
coagulopathy
is
presented
.

The
39-year
-
old
woman
had
spread
a
warfarin
-type

rat
poison
around
her
house
weekly
using
her
bare
hands
,
with
no
washing
post
application
.

Percutaneous
absorption
of
warfarin
causing
coagulopathy
,
reported
three
times
in
the
past
,
is
a
significant
risk
if
protective

,
are
not
used

An
adverse
drug
interaction
with
piroxicam
,
which
she
took
occasionally
,
may
have
exacerbated
the
coagulopathy
.

Delirium
during
fluoxetine
treatment
.

A
case
report
.

The
correlation
between
high
serum
tricyclic
antidepressant
concentrations
and
central
nervous
system
side
effects
has
been
well
established
.

Only
a
few
reports
exist
,
however
,
on
the
relationship
between
the
serum
concentrations
of
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
SSRIs
)
and
their
toxic
effects
.

In
some
cases
,
a
high
serum
concentration
of
citalopram

(
>
600
nmol
/
L
)
in
elderly
patients
has
been
associated
with
increased
somnolence
and
movement
difficulties
.

Widespread
cognitive
disorders
,
such
as
delirium
,
have
not
been
previously
linked
with
high
blood
levels
of
SSRIs
.

In
this
report
,
we
describe
a
patient
with
acute
hyperkinetic
delirium
connected
with
a
high
serum
total
fluoxetine

(
fluoxetine
plus
desmethylfluoxetine
)
concentration

Pulmonary

after
high

dose
aracytine
-
C
for
lymphoma
;
possible
role
of
TNF
-
alpha
and
PAF
.

Four
out
of
23
consecutive
patients
treated
with
high
-
dose
Ara
-
C
for
lymphomas
in
our
institution
developed
a
strikingly
similar
syndrome
during
the
perfusion
.

It
was
characterized
by
the
onset
of
fever
,
diarrhea
,
shock
,
pulmonary
edema
,
acute
renal
failure
,
metabolic
acidosis
,
weight
gain
and
leukocytosis
.

Thorough
bacteriological
screening
failed
to
provide
evidence
of
infection
.

Sequential
biological
assays
of
IL-1
,
IL-2
,
TNF
and
PAF
were
performed
during
Ara
-
C
infusion
to
ten
patients
,
including
the
four
who
developed
the
syndrome
.

TNF
and
PAF
activity
was
found
in
the
serum
of
respectively
two
and
four
of
the
cases
,
but
not
in
the
six
controls
.

As
TNF
and
PAF
are
thought
to
be
involved
in
the
development
of
septic
shock
and
adult
respiratory
distress
syndrome
,
we
hypothesize
that
high
-
dose
Ara
-
C
may
be
associated
with
cytokine
release
.

Protective
effect
of
clentiazem
against
epinephrine
-induced
cardiac
injury
in
rats
.

We
investigated
the
effects
of
clentiazem
,
a
1,5-benzothiazepine
calcium
antagonist
,
on
epinephrine
-induced
cardiomyopathy
in
rats
.

With
2-week
chronic
epinephrine
infusion
,
16
of
30
rats
died
within
4
days
,
and
severe
ischemic
lesions
and
fibrosis
of
the
left
ventricles
were
observed
.

In
epinephrine
-treated
rats
,
left
atrial
and
left
ventricular
papillary
muscle
contractile
responses
to
isoproterenol
were
reduced
,
but
responses
to
calcium
were
normal
or
enhanced
compared
to
controls
.

Left
ventricular
alpha
and
beta
adrenoceptor
densities
were
also
reduced
compared
to
controls
.

Treatment
with
clentiazem
prevented

epinephrine
-induced
death
(
P
.05
)
,
and
attenuated
the
ventricular

,
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

Left
atrial
and
left
ventricular
papillary
muscle
contractile
responses
to
isoproterenol
were
reduced
compared
to
controls
in
groups
treated
with
clentiazem
alone
,
but
combined
with
epinephrine
,

clentiazem
restored
left
atrial
responses
and
enhanced
left
ventricular
papillary
responses
to
isoproterenol
.

On
the
other
hand
clentiazem
did
not
prevent
epinephrine
-induced
down
-
regulation
of
alpha
and
beta
adrenoceptors
.

Interestingly
,
clentiazem
,
infused
alone
,
resulted
in
decreased
adrenergic
receptor
densities
in
the
left
ventricle
.

Clentiazem
also
did
not
prevent
the
enhanced
responses
to
calcium
seen
in
the
epinephrine
-treated
animals
,
although
the
high
dose
of
clentiazem
partially
attenuated
the
maximal
response
to
calcium
compared
to

epinephrine
-treated
animals
.

In
conclusion
,
clentiazem
attenuated

epinephrine
-induced

cardiac
injury
,
possibly
through
its
effect
on
the
adrenergic
pathway
.

Cocaine
induced

myocardial
ischemia
.

We
report
a
case
of
myocardial
ischemia
induced
by
cocaine
.

The
ischemia
probably
induced
by
coronary
artery
spasm
was
reversed
by
nitroglycerin
and
calcium
blocking
agents
.

Doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
monitored
by
ECG
in
freely
moving
mice
.

A
new
model
to
test
potential
protectors
.

In
laboratory
animals
,
histology
is
most
commonly
used
to
study
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.

However
,
for
monitoring
during
treatment
,
large
numbers
of
animals
are
needed
.

Recently
we
developed
a
new
method
to
measure
ECG
values
in
freely
moving
mice
by
telemetry
.

With
this
model
we
investigated
the
effect
of
chronic
doxorubicin
administration
on
the
ECG
of
freely
moving
BALB
/

c
mice
and
the
efficacy
of
ICRF-187
as
a
protective
agent
.

The
ST
interval
significantly
widened
from
15.0
+
/-
1.5
to
56.8
+
/-

11.8
ms
in
week
10
(
7
weekly
doses
of
4
mg
/
kg
doxorubicin
given
i.v
.
plus
3
weeks
of
observation
)
.

The
ECG
of
the
control
animals
did
not
change
during
the
entire
study
.

After
sacrifice
the
hearts
of

doxorubicin
-treated
animals
were
enlarged
and
the
atria
were
hypertrophic
.

As
this
schedule
exerted
more
toxicity
than
needed
to
investigate
protective
agents
,
the
protection
of
ICRF-187
was
determined
using
a
dose
schedule
with
lower
general
toxicity

(
6
weekly
doses
of
4
mg
/
kg
doxorubicin
given
i.v
.

plus
2
weeks
of
observation
)
.

On
this
schedule
,
the
animals
'
hearts
appeared
normal
after
sacrifice
and
ICRF-187
(
50
mg
/
kg
given
i.p
.

1
h
before
doxorubicin
)
provided
almost
full
protection
.

These
data
were
confirmed
by
histology
.

The
results
indicate
that
this
new
model
is
very
sensitive
and
enables
monitoring
of
the
development
of
cardiotoxicity
with
time
.

These
findings
result
in
a
model
that
allows
the
testing
of
protectors
against
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
as
demonstrated
by
the
protection
provided
by
ICRF-187
.

Epinephrine
dysrhythmogenicity
is
not
enhanced
by
subtoxic
bupivacaine
in
dogs
.

Since
bupivacaine
and
epinephrine
may
both
precipitate
dysrhythmias
,
circulating
bupivacaine
during
regional
anesthesia
could
potentiate
dysrhythmogenic
effects
of
epinephrine
.

We
therefore
examined
whether
bupivacaine
alters
the
dysrhythmogenicity
of
subsequent
administration
of
epinephrine
in
conscious
,
healthy
dogs
and
in
anesthetized
dogs
with
myocardial
infarction
.

Forty
-
one
conscious
dogs
received
10
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
epinephrine
.

Seventeen
animals
responded
with
ventricular
tachycardia

(
VT
)
within
3
min
.

After
3
h
,
these
responders
randomly
received
1
or
2
mg
/
kg

bupivacaine
or
saline
over
5
min
,
followed
by
10
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
epinephrine
.

In
the
bupivacaine
groups
,
epinephrine
caused
fewer
prodysrhythmic
effects
than
without
bupivacaine
.

VT
appeared
in
fewer
dogs
and
at
a
later
time
,
and
there
were
more
sinoatrial
beats
and
less
ectopies
.

Epinephrine
shortened
QT
less
after
bupivacaine
than
in
control
animals
.

One
day
after
experimental
myocardial
infarction
,
six
additional
halothane
-anesthetized
dogs
received
4
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
epinephrine
until
VT
appeared
.

After
45
min
,
1
mg
/
kg
bupivacaine
was
injected
over
5
min
,
again
followed
by
4
micrograms.kg-1.min-1
epinephrine
.

In
these
dogs
,
the
prodysrhythmic
response
to
epinephrine
was
also
mitigated
by
preceding
bupivacaine
.

Bupivacaine
antagonizes
epinephrine
dysrhythmogenicity
in
conscious
dogs
susceptible
to
VT
and
in
anesthetized
dogs
with
spontaneous
postinfarct

dysrhythmias
.

There
is
no
evidence
that
systemic
subtoxic
bupivacaine
administration
enhances
the
dysrhythmogenicity
of
subsequent
epinephrine
.

Milk
-
alkali
syndrome
induced
by
1,25(OH)2D
in
a
patient
with
hypoparathyroidism
.

Milk
-
alkali
syndrome
was
first
described
70
years
ago
in
the
context
of
the
treatment
of
peptic
ulcer
disease
with
large
amounts
of
calcium
and
alkali
.

Although
with
current
ulcer
therapy
(
H-2
blockers
,
omeprazole
,
and
sucralfate
)
,
the
frequency
of
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
has
decreased
significantly
,
the
classic
triad
of
hypercalcemia
,
alkalosis
,
and
renal
impairment
remains
the
hallmark
of
the
syndrome
.

Milk
-
alkali
syndrome
can
present
serious
and
occasionally
life
-
threatening
illness
unless
diagnosed
and
treated
appropriately
.

This
article
presents
a
patient
with
hypoparathyroidism
who
was
treated
with
calcium
carbonate
and
calcitriol
resulting
in
two
admissions
to
the
hospital
for
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
.

The
patient
was
successfully
treated
with
intravenous
pamidronate
on
his
first
admission
and
with
hydrocortisone
on
the
second
.

This
illustrates
intravenous
pamidronate
as
a
valuable
therapeutic
tool
when
milk
-
alkali
syndrome
presents
as
hypercalcemic
emergency
.

Encephalopathy
during
amitriptyline
therapy
:
are
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
and
serotonin
syndrome
spectrum
disorders
?

This
report
describes
a
case
of
encephalopathy
developed
in
the
course
of
amitriptyline
therapy
,
during
a
remission
of
unipolar
depression
.

This
patient
could
have
been
diagnosed
as
having
either
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome

(
NMS
)
or
serotonin
syndrome

(
SS
)
.

The
major
determinant
of
the
symptoms
may
have
been
dopamine
/
serotonin
imbalance
in
the
central
nervous
system
.

The
NMS
-like

encephalopathy
that
develops
in
association
with
the
use
of
antidepressants
indicates
that
NMS
and
SS
are
spectrum
disorders
induced
by
drugs
with
both
antidopaminergic
and
serotonergic
effects
.

Genetic
separation
of
tumor
growth
and
hemorrhagic
phenotypes
in
an
estrogen
-induced
tumor
.

Chronic
administration
of
estrogen
to
the
Fischer
344
(
F344
)
rat
induces
growth
of
large
,
hemorrhagic
pituitary
tumors
.

Ten
weeks
of
diethylstilbestrol

(
DES
)
treatment
caused
female
F344
rat
pituitaries
to
grow
to
an
average
of
109.2
+
/-

6.3
mg
(
mean
+
/-
SE
)

versus
11.3
+
/-

1.4
mg
for
untreated
rats
,
and
to
become
highly
hemorrhagic
.

The
same
DES
treatment
produced
no
significant
growth
(
8.9
+
/-
0.5
mg
for
treated
females
versus
8.7
+
/-
1.1
for
untreated
females
)
or
morphological
changes
in
Brown
Norway
(
BN
)
rat
pituitaries
.

An
F1
hybrid
of
F344
and
BN
exhibited
significant
pituitary
growth
after
10
weeks
of
DES
treatment
with
an
average
mass
of
26.3
+
/-

0.7
mg
compared
with
8.6
+
/-
0.9
mg
for
untreated
rats
.

Surprisingly
,
the
F1
hybrid

tumors
were
not
hemorrhagic
and
had
hemoglobin
content
and
outward
appearance
identical
to
that
of
BN
.

Expression
of
both
growth
and
morphological
changes
is
due
to
multiple
genes
.

However
,
while
DES
-induced
pituitary
growth
exhibited
quantitative
,
additive
inheritance
,
the
hemorrhagic
phenotype
exhibited
recessive
,
epistatic
inheritance
.

Only
5
of
the
160
F2
pituitaries
exhibited
the
hemorrhagic
phenotype
;
36
of
the
160
F2
pituitaries
were
in
the
F344
range
of
mass
,
but
31
of
these
were
not
hemorrhagic
,
indicating
that
the
hemorrhagic
phenotype
is
not
merely
a
consequence
of
extensive
growth
.

The
hemorrhagic
F2
pituitaries
were
all
among
the
most
massive
,
indicating
that
some
of
the
genes
regulate
both
phenotypes
.

Increased
expression
of
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
in
bladder
afferent
pathways
following
chronic

.

Immunocytochemical
techniques
were
used
to
examine
alterations
in
the
expression
of
neuronal
nitric
oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
in
bladder
pathways
following
acute
and
chronic
irritation
of
the
urinary
tract
of
the
rat
.

Chemical
cystitis
was
induced
by
cyclophosphamide

(
CYP
)
which
is
metabolized
to
acrolein
,
an
irritant
eliminated
in
the
urine
.

Injection
of
CYP

(
n
=
10
,
75
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)

2
hours
prior
to
perfusion
(
acute
treatment
)
of
the
animals
increased
Fos
-
immunoreactivity
(
IR
)
in
neurons
in
the
dorsal
commissure
,
dorsal
horn
,
and
autonomic
regions
of
spinal
segments
(
L1-L2
and
L6-S1
)
which
receive
afferent
inputs
from
the
bladder
,
urethra
,
and
ureter
.

Fos
-
IR
in
the
spinal
cord
was
not
changed
in
rats
receiving
chronic
CYP
treatment
(
n
=
15
,
75
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
,
every
3rd
day
for
2
weeks
)
.

In
control
animals
and
in
animals
treated
acutely
with
CYP
,
only
small
numbers
of
NOS
-
IR
cells
(
0.5
-
0.7
cell
profiles
/
sections
)
were
detected
in
the
L6-S1
dorsal
root
ganglia
(
DRG
)
.

Chronic
CYP
administration
significantly
(
P
or
=
.002
)
increased
bladder
weight
by
60
%
and
increased
(

7-
to
11-fold
)
the
numbers
of
NOS
-
immunoreactive
(
IR
)
afferent
neurons
in
the
L6-S1
DRG
.

A
small
increase
(
1.5-fold
)
also
occurred
in
the
L1
DRG
,
but
no
change
was
detected
in
the
L2
and
L5
DRG
.

Bladder
afferent
cells
in
the
L6-S1
DRG
labeled
by
Fluorogold
(
40
microliters
)
injected
into
the
bladder
wall
did
not
exhibit
NOS
-
IR
in
control
animals
;
however
,
following
chronic
CYP
administration
,
a
significant
percentage
of
bladder
afferent
neurons
were
NOS
-
IR
:
L6
(
19.8
+
/-
4.6
%
)
and
S1
(
25.3
+
/-

2.9
%
)
.

These
results
indicate
that
neuronal
gene
expression
in
visceral
sensory
pathways
can
be
upregulated
by
chemical
irritation
of
afferent
receptors
in
the
urinary
tract
and/or
that
pathological
changes
in
the
urinary
tract
can
initiate
chemical
signals
that
alter
the
chemical
properties
of
visceral
afferent
neurons
.

Effects
of
a
new
calcium
antagonist
,
CD-832
,
on
isoproterenol
-induced
myocardial
ischemia
in
dogs
with
partial
coronary
stenosis
.

Effects
of
CD-832
on
isoproterenol

(
ISO
)
-induced

myocardial
ischemia
were
studied
in
dogs
with
partial
coronary
stenosis
of
the
left
circumflex
coronary
artery
and
findings
were
compared
with
those
for
nifedipine
or
diltiazem
.

In
the
presence
of
coronary
artery
stenosis
,
3-min
periods
of
intracoronary
ISO
infusion
(
10
ng
/
kg
/
min
)
increased
heart
rate
and
maximal
rate
of
left
ventricular
pressure
rise
,
which
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
percentage
segmental
shortening
and
ST
-
segment
elevation
of
the
epicardial
electrocardiogram
.

After
the
control
ISO
infusion
with
stenosis
was
performed
,
equihypotensive
doses
of
CD-832

(
3
and
10
micrograms
/
kg
/
min
,
n
=
7
)
,
nifedipine

(
1
and
3
micrograms
/
kg
/
min
,
n
=
9
)
or
diltiazem
(
10
and
30
micrograms
/
kg
/
min
,
n
=
7
)
were
infused
5
min
before
and
during
the
second
and
third
ISO
infusion
.

Both
CD-832
and
diltiazem
,
but
not
nifedipine
,
significantly
reduced
the
increase
in
heart
rate
induced
by
ISO
infusion
.

In
contrast
to
nifedipine
,
CD-832
(
10
micrograms
/
kg
/
min
)
prevented
the
decrease
in
percentage
segmental
shortening
from
32
+
/-

12
%
to
115
+
/-

26
%
of
the
control
value
(
P
.01
)
and
ST
-
segment
elevation
from
5.6
+
/-

1.0
mV
to
1.6
+
/-

1.3
mV
(
P
.01
)
at
3
min
after
ISO
infusion
with
stenosis
.

Diltiazem
(
30
micrograms
/
kg
/
min
)
also
prevented
the
decrease
in
percentage
segmental
shortening
from
34
+
/-

14
%
to
63
+
/-

18
%
of
the
control
value
(
P
.05
)
and
ST
-
segment
elevation
from
4.7
+
/-

0.7
mV
to
2.1
+
/-

0.7
mV
(
P
.01
)
at
3
min
after
ISO
infusion
with
stenosis
.

These
data
show
that
CD-832
improves
myocardial
ischemia
during
ISO
infusion
with
stenosis
and
suggest
that
the
negative
chronotropic
property
of
CD-832
plays
a
major
role
in
the
beneficial
effects
of
CD-832
.

The
effect
of
recombinant
human
insulin
-
like
growth
factor
-
I
on
chronic
puromycin
aminonucleoside
nephropathy
in
rats
.

We
recently
demonstrated
that
recombinant
hGH
exacerbates
renal
functional
and
structural
injury
in
chronic
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)

nephropathy
,
an
experimental
model
of
glomerular

.

Therefore
,
we
examined
whether
recombinant
human
(
rh
)
IGF
-
I
is
a
safer
alternative
for
the
treatment
of
growth
failure
in
rats
with
chronic
PAN
nephropathy
.

The
glomerulopathy
was
induced
by
seven
serial
injections
of
PAN
over
12
wk
.

Experimental
animals
(
n
=
6
)
received
rhIGF
-
I
,
400
micrograms
/
d
,
whereas
control
rats
(
n
=
6
)
received
the
vehicle
.

rhIGF
-
I
improved
weight
gain
by
14
%
(
p
0.05
)
,
without
altering
hematocrit
or
blood
pressure
in
rats
with
renal
disease
.

Urinary
protein
excretion
was
unaltered
by
rhIGF
-
I
treatment
in
rats
with
chronic
PAN
nephropathy
.

After
12
wk
,
the
inulin
clearance
was
higher
in
rhIGF
-
I
-
treated
rats
,
0.48
+
/-
0.08
versus
0.24

0.06
mL
/
min/100
g
of
body
weight
in
untreated
PAN
nephropathy
animals
,
p
0.05
.

The
improvement
in
GFR
was
not
associated
with
enhanced
glomerular
hypertrophy
or
increased
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
,
tubulointerstitial
injury
,
or
renal
cortical
malondialdehyde
content
.

In
rats
with
PAN

nephropathy
,
administration
of
rhIGF
-
I
increased
IGF
-
I
and
GH
receptor
gene
expression
,
without
altering
the
steady
state
level
of
IGF
-
I
receptor
mRNA
.

In
normal
rats
with
intact
kidneys
,
rhIGF
-
I
administration
(
n
=
4
)
did
not
alter
weight
gain
,
blood

,
proteinuria
,
GFR
,
glomerular
planar
area
,
renal
cortical
malondialdehyde
content
,
or
glomerular
or
tubulointerstitial

,
compared
with
untreated
animals
(
n
=

)
.

rhIGF
-

I
treatment
reduced
the

renal
IGF
-
I
mRNA
level
but
did
not
modify
gene
expression
of
the
IGF

I
or
GH
receptors
.

We
conclude
that
:
1
)
administration
of
rhIGF

I
improves
growth
and
GFR
in
rats
with
chronic
PAN

nephropathy
and
2

effects
.

Nefiracetam
is
a
novel
pyrrolidone
derivative
which
attenuates
scopolamine
-induced
learning
and
post
-
training
consolidation
deficits
.

Given
that
apomorphine
inhibits
passive
avoidance
retention
when
given
during
training
or
in
a
defined
10
-
12h
post
-
training
period
,
we
evaluated
the
ability
of
nefiracetam
to
attenuate
amnesia
induced
by
dopaminergic
agonism
.

A
step
-
down
passive
avoidance
paradigm
was
employed
and
nefiracetam

(
3
mg
/
kg
)
and
apomorphine

(
0.5
mg
/
kg
)
were
given
alone
or
in
combination
during
training
and
at
the
10
-
12h
post
-
training
period
of
consolidation
.

Co
-
administration
of
nefiracetam
and
apomorphine
during
training
or
10h
thereafter
produced
no
significant
anti
-
amnesic
effect
.

However
,
administration
of
nefiracetam
during
training
completely
reversed
the
amnesia
induced
by
apomorphine
at
the
10h
post
-
training
time
and
the
converse
was
also
true
.

These
effects
were
not
mediated
by
a
dopaminergic
mechanism
as
nefiracetam
,
at
millimolar
concentrations
,
failed
to
displace
either
[
3H
]
SCH
23390
or
[
3H
]
spiperone
binding
from
D1
or
D2

dopamine
receptor
subtypes
,
respectively
.

It
is
suggested
that
nefiracetam
augments
molecular
processes
in
the
early
stages
of
events
which
ultimately
lead
to
consolidation
of
memory
.

Human
corticotropin

-releasing
hormone
and
thyrotropin
-releasing
hormone
modulate
the
hypercapnic
ventilatory
response
in
humans
.

Human
corticotropin

-releasing
hormone
(
hCRH
)
and
thyrotropin
-releasing
hormone
(
TRH
)
are
known
to
stimulate
ventilation
after
i.v
.

administration
in
humans
.

In
a
placebo
-
controlled
,
single
-
blind
study
we
aimed
to
clarify
if
both
peptides
act
by
altering
central
chemosensitivity
.

Two
subsequent
CO2

-rebreathing
tests
were
performed
in
healthy
young
volunteers
.

During
the
first
test
0.9
%
NaCl
was
given
i.v
.
;
during
the
second
test
200
micrograms
of
hCRH
(
n
=
12
)
or
400
micrograms
of
TRH
(
n
=
6
)
was
administered
i.v
.

Nine
subjects
received
0.9
%
NaCl
i.v
.

during
both
rebreathing
manoeuvres
.

The
CO2
-response
curves
for
the
two
tests
were
compared
within
the
same
subject
.

In
the
hCRH
group
a
marked
parallel
shift
of
the
CO2
-response
curve
to
the
left
was
observed
after
hCRH
(
P
0.01
)
.

The
same
effect
occurred
following
TRH
but
was
less
striking
(
P
=
0.05
)
.

hCRH
and
TRH
caused
a
reduction
in
the
CO2
threshold
.

The
CO2
-response
curves
in
the
control
group
were
nearly
identical
.

The
results
indicate
an
additive
effect
of
both
releasing
hormones
on
the
hypercapnic
ventilatory
response
in
humans
,
presumably
independent
of
central
chemosensitivity
.

Lamivudine
is
effective
in
suppressing
hepatitis
B
virus
DNA
in
Chinese

hepatitis
B
surface
antigen
carriers
:
a
placebo
-
controlled
trial
.

Lamivudine
is
a
novel
2',3'-dideoxy
cytosine
analogue
that
has
potent
inhibitory
effects
on
hepatitis
B
virus
replication
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

We
performed
a
single
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
study
to
assess
its
effectiveness
and
safety
in
Chinese
hepatitis
B
surface
antigen

(
HBsAg
)
carriers
.

Forty
-
two

Chinese
HBsAg
carriers
were
randomized
to
receive
placebo
(
6
patients
)
or
lamivudine
orally
in
dosages
of
25
mg
,
100
mg
,
or
300
mg
daily
(
12
patients
for
each
dosage
)
.

The
drug
was
given
for
4
weeks
.

The
patients
were
closely
monitored
clinically
,
biochemically
,
and
serologically
up
to
4
weeks
after
drug
treatment
.

All
36
patients
receiving
lamivudine
had
a
decrease
in
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
DNA
values
of
>
90
%
(
P
.001
compared
with
placebo
)
.

Although
25
mg
of
lamivudine
was
slightly
less
effective
than
100
mg
(
P
=
.011
)
and
300
mg
(
P
=
.005
)
,
it
still
induced
94
%
suppression
of
HBV
DNA
after
the
fourth
week
of
therapy
.

HBV
DNA
values
returned
to
pretreatment
levels
within
4
weeks
of
cessation
of
therapy
.

There
was
no
change
in
the
hepatitis
B

e
antigen
status
or
in
aminotransferase
levels
.

No
serious
adverse
events
were
observed
.

In
conclusion
,
a
4-week
course
of
lamivudine
was
safe
and
effective
in
suppression
of
HBV
DNA
in
Chinese
HBsAg
carriers
.

The
suppression
was
>
90
%
but
reversible
.

Studies
with
long

term
lamivudine
administration
should
be
performed
to
determine
if
prolonged
suppression
of
HBV
DNA
can
be
achieved
.

Population
-
based
study
of
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
associated
with
various
oral
contraceptives
.

BACKGROUND
:

Four
studies
published
since
December
,
1995
,
reported
that
the
incidence
of
venous
thromboembolism

(
VTE
)
was
higher
in
women
who
used
oral
contraceptives

(
OCs
)
containing
the
third
-
generation
progestagens
gestodene
or
desogestrel
than
in
users
of
OCs
containing
second
-
generation
progestagens
.

However
,
confounding
and
bias
in
the
design
of
these
studies
may
have
affected
the
findings
.

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
re
-
examine
the
association
between
risk
of
VTE
and
OC
use
with
a
different
study
design
and
analysis
to
avoid
some
of
the
bias
and
confounding
of
the
earlier
studies
.

METHODS
:

We
used
computer
records
of
patients
from
143
general
practices
in
the
UK
.

The
study
was
based
on
the
medical
records
of
about
540,000
women
born
between
1941
and
1981
.

All
women
who
had
a
recorded
diagnosis
of
deep
-
vein
thrombosis
,
venous
thrombosis
not
otherwise
specified
,
or
pulmonary
embolus
during
the
study
period
,
and
who
had
been
treated
with
an
anticoagulant
were
identified
as
potential
cases
of
VTE
.

We
did
a
cohort
analysis
to
estimate
and
compare
incidence
of
VTE
in
users
of
the
main
OC
preparations
,
and
a
nested
case
-
control
study
to
calculate
the
odds
ratios
of
VTE
associated
with
use
of
different
types
of
OC
,
after
adjustment
for
potential
confounding
factors
.

In
the
case
-
control
study
,
we
matched
cases
to
controls
by
exact
year
of
birth
,
practice
,
and
current
use
of
OCs
.

We
used
a
multiple
logistic
regression
model
that
included
body
-
mass
index
,
number
of
cycles
,
change
in
type
of
OC
prescribed
within
3
months
of
the
event
,
previous
pregnancy
,
and
concurrent
disease
.

FINDINGS
:
85
women
met
the
inclusion
criteria
for
VTE
,
two
of
whom
were
users
of
progestagen
-only
OCs
.

Of
the
83
cases
of
VTE
associated
with
use
of
combined
OCs
,
43
were
recorded
as
deep
-
vein
thrombosis
,
35
as
pulmonary
thrombosis
,
and
five
as
venous
thrombosis
not
otherwise
specified
.

The
crude
rate
of
VTE
per
10,000
woman
-
years
was
4.10
in
current
users
of
any
OC
,
3.10
in
users
of
second
-
generation
OCs
,
and
4.96
in
users
of
third
-
generation
preparations
.

After
adjustment
for
age
,
the
rate
ratio
of
VTE
in
users
of
third
-
generation
relative
to
second
-
generation
OCs
was
1.68
(
95
%
CI
1.04
-
2.75
)
.

Logistic
regression
showed
no
significant
difference
in
the
risk
of
VTE
between
users
of
third
-
generation
and
second
-
generation
OCs
.

Among
users
of
third
-
generation
progestagens
,
the
risk
of
VTE
was
higher
in
users
of
desogestrel
with
20
g
ethinyloestradiol
than
in
users
of
gestodene
or
desogestrel
with
30
g
ethinyloestradiol
.

With
all
second
-
generation
OCs
as
the
reference
,
the
odds
ratios
for
VTE
were
3.49
(
1.21
-
10.12
)
for
desogestrel
plus

20
g
ethinyloestradiol
and
1.18

(
0.66
-
2.17
)
for
the
other
third
-
generation
progestagens
.

INTERPRETATION
:

The
previously
reported
increase
in
odds
ratio
associated
with
third
-
generation
OCs
when
compared
with
second
-
generation
products
is
likely
to
have
been
the
result
of
residual
confounding
by
age
.

The
increased
odds
ratio
associated
with
products
containing
20
micrograms
ethinyloestradiol
and
desogestrel
compared
with
the
30
micrograms
product
is
biologically
implausible
,
and
is
likely
to
be
the
result
of
preferential
prescribing
and
,
thus
,
confounding
.

The
authors
examined
the
anticonvulsant
effects
of
MK-801
on
the
pilocarpine
-induced

seizure
model
.

Intraperitoneal
injection
of
pilocarpine

(
400
mg

kg
)
induced
tonic
and
clonic
seizure
.

Scopolamine

(
10
mg
/
kg
)
and
pentobarbital
(
5
mg
/
kg
)
prevented
development
of
pilocarpine
-induced

behavioral
seizure
but
MK-801
(
0.5
mg
/
kg
)
did
not
.

.

An
electrical
seizure
measured
with
hippocampal
EEG
appeared
in
the
pilocarpine
-treated
group
.

Scopolamine
and
pentobarbital
blocked
the
pilocarpine
-induced
electrographic
seizure
,
MK-801

treatment
augmented
the
electrographic
seizure
induced
by
pilocarpine
.

.

Brain
damage
was
assessed
by
examining
the
hippocampus
microscopically
.

Pilocarpine
produced

neuronal
death
in
the
hippocampus
,
which
showed
pyknotic
changes
.

Pentobarbital
,
scopolamine
and
MK-801
protected
the
brain
damage
by
pilocarpine
,
though
in
the
MK-801
-treated
group
,
the
pyramidal
cells
of
hippocampus
appeared
darker
than
normal
.

In
all
treatments
,
granule
cells
of
the
dentate
gyrus
were
not
affected
.

These
results
indicate
that
status
epilepticus
induced
by
pilocarpine
is
initiated
by
cholinergic
overstimulation

propagated
by
glutamatergic
transmission

.

This
study
prospectively
evaluated
the
clinical
efficacy
,
the
incidence
of
torsades

pointes
,
and
the
presumable
risk
factors
for
torsades
de
pointes
in
patients
treated
with
d
,
l
-
sotalol
for
sustained
ventricular
tachyarrhythmias
.

Eighty
-
one
consecutive
patients
(
54
with
coronary
artery
disease
,
and
20
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy
)
with
inducible
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
or
ventricular
fibrillation
received
oral
d
,
l
-
sotalol
to
prevent
induction
of
the
ventricular
tachyarrhythmia
.

During
oral
loading
with
d
,
l
-
sotalol
,
continuous
electrocardiographic
(
ECG
)
monitoring
was
performed
.

Those
patients
in
whom
d
,
l
-
sotalol
prevented
induction
of
ventricular
tachycardia
or
ventricular
fibrillation
were
discharged
with
the
drug
and
followed
up
on
an
outpatient
basis
for
21
+
/-

18
months
.

Induction
of
the
ventricular
tachyarrhythmia
was
prevented
by
oral
d
,
l
-
sotalol
in
35
(
43
%
)
patients
;
the
ventricular
tachyarrhythmia
remained
inducible
in
40
(
49
%
)
patients
;
and
two
(
2.5
%
)

patients
did
not
tolerate
even
40
mg
of
d
,
l
-
sotalol
once
daily
.

Four
(
5
%
)
patients
had
from

torsades
de
pointes
during
the
initial
oral
treatment
with
d
,
l
-
sotalol
.

Neither
ECG
[
sinus
-
cycle
length
(
SCL
)
,
QT
or
QTc
interval
,
or
U
wave
]
nor
clinical
parameters
identified
patients
at
risk
for
torsades
de
pointes
.

However
,
the
oral
dose
of
d
,
l
-
sotalol
was
significantly
lower
in
patients
with
torsades
de
pointes

(

+
/-
46
vs.
328
+
/-

53
mg
/
day
;
p
=
0.0017
)
.

Risk
factors
associated
with
the
development
of
torsades
de
pointes
were
the
appearance
of
an
U
wave
(
p
=
0.049
)
,
female
gender
(
p
=

,
and
significant
dose
-
corrected
changes
of
SCL
,
QT

,
and
QTc
interval
(
p
0.05
)
.

During
follow
-
up
,
seven
(
20
%
)
patients
had
a
nonfatal
ventricular
tachycardia
recurrence
,
and
two
(
6
%
)
patients
died
suddenly
.

One
female
patient
with
stable
cardiac
disease
had
recurrent

torsades
de
pointes
after
2
years
of
successful
treatment
with
d
,
l
-
sotalol
.

Torsades
de
pointes
occurred
early
during
treatment
even
with
low
doses
of
oral
d
,
l
-
sotalol
.

Pronounced
changes
in
the
surface
ECG
(
cycle
length
,
QT
,
and
QTc
)
in
relation
to
the
dose
of
oral
d
,
l
-
sotalol
might
identify
a
subgroup
of
patients
with
an
increased
risk
for
torsades
de
pointes
.

Other
ECG
parameters
before
the
application
of
d
,
l
-
sotalol
did
not
identify
patients
at
increased
risk
for
torsades
de
pointes
.

Recurrence
rates
of
ventricular
tachyarrhythmias
are
high
despite
complete
suppression
of
the
arrhythmia
during
programmed
stimulation
.

Therefore
programmed
electrical
stimulation
in
the
case
of
d
,
l
-
sotalol
seems
to
be
of
limited
prognostic
value
.

Chronic
hyperprolactinemia
and

neurons
.

The
tuberoinfundibular
dopaminergic
(
TIDA
)
system
is
known
to
inhibit
prolactin
(
PRL
)
secretion
.

In
young
animals
this
system
responds
to
acute
elevations
in
serum
PRL
by
increasing
its
activity
.

However
,
this
responsiveness
is
lost
in
aging
rats
with
chronically
high
serum
PRL
levels
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
induce
hyperprolactinemia
in
rats
for
extended
periods
of
time
and
examine
its
effects
on
dopaminergic
systems
in
the
brain
.

Hyperprolactinemia
was
induced
by
treatment
with
haloperidol
,
a
dopamine
receptor
antagonist
,
and
Palkovits
'
microdissection
technique
in
combination
with
high
-
performance
liquid
chromatography
was
used
to
measure
neurotransmitter
concentrations
in
several
areas
of
the
brain
.

After
6
months
of
hyperprolactinemia
,
dopamine
(
DA
)
concentrations
in
the
median
eminence
(
ME
)
increased
by
84
%
over
the
control
group
.

Nine
months
of
hyperprolactinemia
produced
a
50
%
increase
in
DA
concentrations
in
the
ME
over
the
control
group
.

However
,
DA
response
was
lost
if
a
9-month
long
haloperidol
-induced
hyperprolactinemia
was
followed
by
a
1
1/2
month
-
long
extremely
high
increase
in
serum
PRL
levels
produced
by
implantation
of
MMQ
cells
under
the
kidney
capsule
.

There
was
no
change
in
the
levels
of
DA
,
norepinephrine

(
NE
)
,
serotonin

(
5-HT
)
,
or
their
metabolites
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
(
AN
)
,
medial
preoptic
area
(
MPA
)
,
caudate
putamen
(
CP
)
,
substantia
nigra
(
SN
)
,
and
zona
incerta
(
ZI
)
,
except
for
a
decrease
in
5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid

(
5-HIAA
)
in
the
AN
after
6-months
of
hyperprolactinemia
and
an
increase
in
DA
concentrations
in
the
AN
after
9-months
of
hyperprolactinemia
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
hyperprolactinemia
specifically
affects
TIDA
neurons
and
these
effects
vary
,
depending
on
the
duration
and
intensity
of
hyperprolactinemia
.

The
age
-
related
decrease
in
hypothalamic
dopamine
function
may
be
associated
with
increases
in
PRL
secretion
.

Treatment
-
related
disseminated
necrotizing
leukoencephalopathy
with
characteristic
contrast
enhancement
of
the
white
matter
.

This
report
describes
unique
contrast
enhancement
of
the
white
matter
on
T1-weighted
magnetic
resonance
images
of
two
patients
with
disseminated
necrotizing
leukoencephalopathy
,
which
developed
from
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
treated
with
high
-
dose
methotrexate
.

In
both
patients
,
the
enhancement
was
more
pronounced
near
the
base
of
the
brain
than
at
the
vertex
.

Necropsy
of
the
first
case
revealed
loss
of
myelination
and
necrosis
of
the
white
matter
.

Possible
mechanisms
causing
such
a
leukoencephalopathy
are
discussed
.

Thrombotic
complications
in
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
during
all
-
trans
-
retinoic
acid
therapy
.

A
case
of
acute
renal
failure
,
due
to
occlusion
of
renal
vessels
in
a
patient
with
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia

(
APL
)
treated
with
all
-
trans
-
retinoic
acid

(
ATRA
)
and
tranexamic
acid
has
been
described
recently
.

We
report
a
case
of
acute
renal
failure
in
an
APL
patient
treated
with
ATRA
alone
.

This
case
further
supports
the
concern
about
thromboembolic
complications
associated
with
ATRA
therapy
in
APL
patients
.

The
patients
,
a
43-year
-
old
man
,
presented
all
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
APL
and
was
included
in
a
treatment
protocol
with
ATRA
.

After
10
days
of
treatment
,
he
developed
acute
renal
failure

that
was
completely
reversible
after
complete
remission
of

APL
was
achieved
and
therapy
discontinued
.

We
conclude
that
ATRA
is
a
valid
therapeutic
choice
for
patients
with
APL
,
although
the
procoagulant
tendency
is
not
completely
corrected
.

Thrombotic
events
,
however
,
could
be
avoided
by
using
low
-
dose
heparin
.

Pupillary
changes
associated
with
the
development
of
stimulant
-
induced
mania
:
a
case
report
.

A
30-year
-
old
cocaine
-dependent
man
who
was
a
subject
in
a
study
evaluating
the
anticraving
efficacy
of
the
stimulant
medication
diethylpropion

(
DEP
)
became
manic
during
his
second
week
on
the
study
drug
.

Pupillometric
changes
while
on
DEP
,
especially
changes
in
the
total
power
of
pupillary
oscillation
,
were
dramatically
different
than
those
observed
in
the
eight
other
study
subjects
who
did
not
become
manic
.

The
large
changes
in
total
power
of
pupillary
oscillation
occurred
a
few
days
before
the
patient
became
fully
manic
.

Such
medication
-
associated
changes
in
the
total
power
of
pupillary
oscillation
might
be
of
utility
in
identifying
persons
at
risk
for
manic

-like
adverse
effects
during
the
medical
use
of
psychomotor
stimulants
or
sympathomimetic
agents
.

The
negative
mucosal
potential
:
separating
central
and
peripheral
effects
of
NSAIDs
in
man
.

OBJECTIVE
:

We
wanted
to
test
whether
assessment
of
both
a
central
pain
-related
signal
(
chemo
-
somatosensory
evoked
potential
,
CSSEP
)
and
a
concomitantly
recorded
peripheral
signal
(
negative
mucosal
potential
,
NMP
)
allows
for
separation
of
central
and
peripheral
effects
of
NSAIDs
.

For
this
purpose
,
experimental
conditions
were
created
in
which
NSAIDs
had
previously
been
observed
to
produce
effects
on
phasic
and
tonic
pain
by
either
central
or
peripheral
mechanisms
.

METHODS
:

According
to
a
double
-
blind
,
randomised
,
controlled
,
threefold
cross
-
over
design
,
18
healthy
subjects
(
11
males
,
7
females
;
mean
age
26
years
)
received
either
placebo
,
400
mg
ibuprofen
,
or
800
mg
ibuprofen
.

Phasic
pain
was
applied
by
means
of
short
pulses
of
CO2
to
the
nasal
mucosa
(
stimulus
duration
500
ms
,
interval
approximately
60
s
)
,
and
tonic
pain
was
induced
in
the
nasal
cavity
by
means
of
dry
air
of
controlled
temperature
,
humidity
and
flow
rate
(
22
degrees
C
,
0
%
relative
humidity
,
145
ml.s-1
)
.

Both
CSSEPs
as
central
and
NMPs
as
peripheral
correlates
of
pain
were
obtained
in
response
to
the
CO2
stimuli
.

Additionally
,
the
subjects
rated
the
intensity
of
both
phasic
and
tonic
pain
by
means
of
visual
analogue
scales
.

RESULTS
:

As
described
earlier
,
administration
of
ibuprofen
was
followed
by
a
decrease
in
tonic
pain
but
-
relative
to
placebo
-
an
increase
in
correlates
of
phasic
pain
,
indicating
a
specific
effect
of
ibuprofen
on
the
interaction
between
the
pain
stimuli
under
these
special
experimental
conditions
.

Based
on
the
similar
behaviour
of
CSSEP
and
NMP
,
it
was
concluded
that
the
pharmacological
process
underlying
this
phenomenon
was
localised
in
the
periphery
.

By
means
of
the
simultaneous
recording
of
interrelated
peripheral
and
central
electrophysiologic
correlates
of
nociception
,
it
was
possible
to
separate
central
and
peripheral
effects
of
an
NSAID
.

The
major
advantage
of
this
pain
model
is
the
possibility
of
obtaining
peripheral
pain
-related
activity
directly
using
a
non
-
invasive
technique
in
humans
.

Acute
severe
depression
following
peri
-
operative
ondansetron
.

A
41-year
-
old
woman
with
a
strong
history
of
postoperative
nausea
and
vomiting
presented
for
abdominal
hysterectomy
3
months
after
a
previous
anaesthetic
where
ondansetron

prophylaxis
had
been
used
.

She
had
developed
a
severe
acute
major
depression
disorder
almost
immediately
thereafter
,
possibly
related
to
the
use
of
a
serotonin
antagonist
.

Nine
years
before
she
had
experienced
a
self
-
limited
puerperal
depressive
episode
.

Anaesthesia
with
a
propofol
infusion
and
avoidance
of
serotonin
antagonists
provided
a
nausea
-free
postoperative
course
without
exacerbation
of
the
depression
disorder
.

Hypertensive
response
during
dobutamine
stress
echocardiography
.

Among
3,129
dobutamine
stress
echocardiographic
studies
,
a
hypertensive
response
,
defined
as
systolic
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
>
or
=
220
mm
Hg
and/or
diastolic
BP
>
or
=
110
mm
Hg
,
occurred
in
30
patients
(
1
%
)
.

Patients
with
this
response
more
often
had
a
history
of
hypertension
and
had
higher
resting
systolic
and
diastolic
BP
before
dobutamine
infusion
.

Continuously
nebulized
albuterol
in
severe
exacerbations
of
asthma
in
adults
:
a
case
-
controlled
study
.

A
retrospective
,
case
-
controlled
analysis
comparing
patients
admitted
to
a
medical
intensive
care
unit
with
severe
exacerbations
of
asthma
who
received
continuously
nebulized
albuterol
(
CNA
)
versus
intermittent
albuterol

(
INA
)
treatments
is
reported
.

Forty
matched
pairs
of
patients
with
asthma
are
compared
.

CNA
was
administered
for
a
mean
of
11
+
/-

10
hr
.

The
incidence
of
cardiac
dysrhythmias
was
similar
between
groups
.

Symptomatic

hypokalemia
did
not
occur
.

CNA
patients
had
higher
heart
rates
during
treatment
,
which
may
reflect
severity
of
illness
.

The
incidence
of
intubation
was
similar
.

We
conclude
that
CNA
and
INA
demonstrated
similar
profiles
with
regard
to
safety
,
morbidity
,
and
mortality
.

Hyperosmolar
nonketotic
coma
precipitated
by
lithium

-induced

nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
.

A
45-year
-
old
man
,
with
a
10-year
history
of
manic
depression
treated
with
lithium
,
was
admitted
with
hyperosmolar
,
nonketotic
coma
.

He
gave
a
five
-
year
history
of
polyuria
and
polydipsia
,
during
which
time
urinalysis
had
been
negative
for
glucose
.

After
recovery
from
hyperglycaemia
,
he
remained

polyuric
despite
normal
blood
glucose
concentrations
;

water
deprivation
testing
indicated
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
,
likely
to
be

lithium

-induced
.

We
hypothesize
that
when
this
man
developed
type
2
diabetes
,
chronic
polyuria
due
to
nephrogenic
diabetes
insipidus
was
sufficient
to
precipitate
hyperosmolar
dehydration
.

Effects
of
the
intracoronary
infusion
of
cocaine
on
left
ventricular
systolic
and
diastolic
function
in
humans
.

BACKGROUND
:

In
dogs
,
a
large
amount
of
intravenous
cocaine
causes
a
profound
deterioration
of
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
systolic
function
and
an
increase
in
LV
end
-
diastolic
pressure
.

This
study
was
done
to
assess
the
influence
of
a
high
intracoronary
cocaine
concentration
on
LV
systolic
and
diastolic
function
in
humans
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:

In
20
patients
(
14
men
and
6
women
aged
39
to
72
years
)
referred
for
cardiac
catheterization
for
the
evaluation
of
chest
pain
,
we
measured
heart
rate
,
systemic
arterial
pressure
,
LV
pressure
and
its
first
derivative
(
dP
/
dt
)
,
and
LV
volumes
and
ejection
fraction
before
and
during
the
final
2
to
3
minutes
of
a
15-minute
intracoronary
infusion
of
saline
(
n=10
,
control
subjects
)
or
cocaine
hydrochloride
1
mg
/
min
(
n=10
)
.

No
variable
changed
with
saline
.

With
cocaine
,
the
drug
concentration
in
blood
obtained
from
the
coronary
sinus
was
3.0+/-0.4
(
mean+/-SD
)
mg
/
L
,
similar
in
magnitude
to
the
blood
cocaine
concentration
reported
in
abusers
dying
of
cocaine
intoxication
.

Cocaine
induced
no
significant
change
in
heart
rate
,
LV
dP
/
dt
(
positive
or
negative
)
,
or
LV
end
-
diastolic
volume
,
but
it
caused
an
increase
in
systolic
and
mean
arterial
pressures
,
LV
end
-
diastolic
pressure
,
and
LV
end
-
systolic
volume
,
as
well
as
a
decrease
in
LV
ejection
fraction
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
humans
,
the
intracoronary
infusion
of
cocaine
sufficient
in
amount
to
achieve
a
high
drug
concentration
in
coronary
sinus
blood
causes
a
deterioration
of
LV
systolic
and
diastolic
performance
.

Heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
,
paradoxical
thromboembolism
,
and
other
side
effects
of
heparin
therapy
.

Although
several
new
anticoagulant
drugs
are
in
development
,
heparin
remains
the
drug
of
choice
for
most
anticoagulation
needs
.

The
clinical
effects
of
heparin
are
meritorious
,
but
side
effects
do
exist
.

Important

therapy
including
heparin

-induced

thrombocytopenia
,
heparin

-associated

osteoporosis
,

other
than
thrombocytopenia
and
alopecia

Nonopaque
crystal
deposition
causing
ureteric
obstruction
in
patients
with
HIV
undergoing
indinavir
therapy
.

OBJECTIVE
:

We
describe
the
unique
CT
features
of
ureteric
calculi
in
six
HIV
-
infected
patients
receiving
indinavir
,
the
most
commonly
used
HIV
protease
inhibitor
,
which
is
associated
with
an
increased
incidence
of
urolithiasis
.

CONCLUSION
:

Ureteric
obstruction
caused
by
precipitated
indinavir
crystals
may
be
difficult
to
diagnose
with
unenhanced
CT
.

The
calculi
are
not
opaque
,
and
secondary
signs
of
obstruction
may
be
absent
or
minimal
and
should
be
sought
carefully
.

Images
may
need
to
be
obtained
using
i.v
.

contrast
material
to
enable
diagnosis
of
ureteric
stones
or
obstruction
in
patients
with
HIV
infection
who
receive
indinavir
therapy
.

Ischemic
colitis
and
sumatriptan
use
.

Sumatriptan
succinate
,
a
serotonin
-1
(
5-hydroxytryptamine
-1
)
receptor
agonist
,
is
an
antimigraine
drug
that
is
reported
to
act
by
selectively
constricting
intracranial
arteries
.

Recently
,
vasopressor
responses
that
are
distinct
from
the
cranial
circulation
have
been
demonstrated
to
occur
in
the
systemic
,
pulmonary
,
and
coronary
circulations
.

Cases
have
been
published
of
coronary
vasospasm
,
myocardial
ischemia
,
and
myocardial
infarction
occurring
after
sumatriptan
use
.

We
report
on
the
development
of
8
serious
cases
of
ischemic
colitis
in
patients
with
migraine
treated
with
sumatriptan
.

Pallidotomy
with
the
gamma
knife
:
a
positive
experience
.

51
patients
with
medically
refractory
Parkinson
's
disease
underwent
stereotactic
posteromedial
pallidotomy
between
August
1993
and
February
1997
for
treatment
of
bradykinesia
,
rigidity
,
and
L
-
DOPA
-induced
dyskinesias
.

In
29
patients
,
the
pallidotomies
were
performed
with
the
Leksell
Gamma
Knife
and
in
22
they
were
performed
with
the
standard
radiofrequency
(
RF
)
method
.

Clinical
assessment
as
well
as
blinded
ratings
of
Unified
Parkinson
's
Disease
Rating
Scale
(
UPDRS
)
scores
were
carried
out
pre-
and
postoperatively
.

Mean
follow
-
up
time
is
20.6
months
(
range
6
-
48
)
and
all
except
4
patients
have
been
followed
more
than
one
year
.

85
percent
of
patients
with
dyskinesias
were
relieved
of
symptoms
,
regardless
of
whether
the
pallidotomies
were
performed
with
the
Gamma
Knife
or
radiofrequency
methods
.

About
2/3
of
the
patients
in
both
Gamma
Knife
and
radiofrequency
groups
showed
improvements
in
bradykinesia
and
rigidity
,
although
when
considered
as
a
group
neither
the
Gamma
Knife
nor
the
radiofrequency
group
showed
statistically
significant
improvements
in
UPDRS
scores
.

One
patient
in
the
Gamma
Knife
group
(
3.4
%
)
developed
a
homonymous
hemianopsia
9
months
following
treatment
and
5
patients
(
27.7
%
)
in
the
radiofrequency
group
became
transiently
confused
postoperatively
.

No
other
complications
were
seen
.

Gamma
Knife
pallidotomy
is
as
effective
as
radiofrequency
pallidotomy
in
controlling
certain
of
the
symptoms
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

It
may
be
the
only
practical
technique
available
in
certain
patients
,
such
as
those
who
take
anticoagulants
,
have
bleeding
diatheses
or
serious
systemic
medical
illnesses
.

It
is
a
viable
option
for
other
patients
as
well
.

Neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
and
methylphenidate
.

A
1-year
-
old
female
presented
with
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
probably
caused
by
methylphenidate
.

She
had
defects
in
the
supratentorial
brain
including
the
basal
ganglia
and
the
striatum
(
multicystic
encephalomalacia
)
due
to
severe
perinatal
hypoxic
-
ischemic
encephalopathy
,
which
was
considered
to
be
a
possible
predisposing
factor
causing
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
.

A
dopaminergic
blockade
mechanism
generally
is
accepted
as
the
pathogenesis
of
this
syndrome
.

However
,
methylphenidate
is
a
dopamine
agonist
via
the
inhibition
of
uptake
of
dopamine
,
and
therefore
dopaminergic
systems
in
the
brainstem
(
mainly
the
midbrain
)
and
the
spinal
cord
were
unlikely
to
participate
in
the
onset
of
this
syndrome
.

A
relative
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
-ergic
deficiency
might
occur
because
diazepam
,
a
gamma
-
aminobutyric
acid
-mimetic
agent
,
was
strikingly
effective
.

This
is

as
of

,
were
analyzed
in
rats
treated
with
EE

(
5
mg

,
3
days
)
or
its

.

BS
pool
size
was
decreased
by
27
%
but
total
BS
synthesis
was
not
affected
by
EE
in
intact
rats
.

Synthesis
of
cholate
was
reduced
by
68
%
in
EE

-treated
rats
,
while
that
of
chenodeoxycholate
was
increased
by
60
%
.

The
recently
identified
Delta22-isomer
of

contributed
for
5.4
%
and
18.3
%
(
P

)
to
the
pool
in
control
and
EE
-treated

,
respectively
,
but
could
not
be
detected
in

after
exhaustion
of
the
pool
.

A
clear
reduction
of
BS
synthesis
was
found
in
bile
-
diverted
rats
treated
with
EE
,
yet
biliary
BS
composition
was
only
minimally
affected
.

Activity
of
CYP7A
was
decreased
by
EE
in
both
intact
and
bile
-
diverted
rats
,
whereas
the
activity
of
the
CYP27
was
not
affected
.

Hepatic
mRNA
levels
of
CYP7A
were
significantly
reduced
by
EE
in
bile
-
diverted
rats
only
;
CYP27
mRNA
levels
were
not
affected
by
EE
.

In
addition
,
mRNA
levels
of
sterol

12alpha
-
hydroxylase
and
lithocholate

6beta
-
hydroxylase
were
increased
by
bile
diversion
and
suppressed
by
EE
.

This
study
shows
that
17alpha
-
ethinylestradiol

(
EE
)
-induced

intrahepatic
cholestasis
in
rats
is
associated
with
selective
inhibition
of
the
neutral

of
bile
salt

(
BS
)
synthesis
.

Simultaneous
impairment
of
other
enzymes
in
the
BS
biosynthetic

may
contribute
to
overall
effects
of
EE
on
BS

.

Glibenclamide
-sensitive
hypotension
produced
by
helodermin
assessed
in
the
rat
.

The
effects
of
helodermin
,
a
basic
35-
amino
acid
peptide
isolated
from
the
venom
of
a
lizard
salivary
gland
,
on
arterial
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
were
examined
in
the
rat
,
focusing
on
the
possibility
that
activation
of
ATP
sensitive
K
+

(
K
(
ATP
)
)
channels
is
involved
in
the
responses
.

The
results
were
also
compared
with
those
of
vasoactive
intestinal
polypeptide
(
VIP
)
.

Helodermin
produced

hypotension
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
with
approximately
similar
potency
and
duration
to
VIP
.

Hypotension
induced
by
both
peptides
was
significantly
attenuated
by
glibenclamide
,
which
abolished
a
levcromakalim
-produced
decrease
in
arterial
blood
pressure
.

Oxyhemoglobin
did
not
affect
helodermin

-induced

hypotension
,

whereas
it
shortened
the
duration
of
acetylcholine

(
ACh
)
-produced

hypotension
.

These
findings
suggest
that
helodermin
-produced

hypotension
is
partly
attributable
to
the
activation
of
glibenclamide
-sensitive

K
+
channels

(
K
(
ATP
)
channels
)
,
which
presumably
exist
on
arterial
smooth
muscle

efficacy
and
adverse
event
of
nifedipine
sustained
-
release
tablets
for
cyclosporin
A

-induced

hypertension
in
patients
with
psoriasis
.

Thirteen

psoriatic
patients
with
hypertension
during
the
course
of
cyclosporin
A
therapy
were
treated
for
25
months
with
a
calcium
channel
blocker
,
sustained
-
release
nifedipine
,
to
study
the
clinical
antihypertensive
effects
and
adverse
events
during
treatment
with
both
drugs
.

Seven
of
the
13
patients
had
exhibited
a
subclinical
hypertensive
state
before
cyclosporin
A
therapy
.

Both
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressures
of
these
13
patients
were
decreased
significantly
after
4
weeks
of
nifedipine
therapy
,
and
blood
pressure
was
maintained
within
the
normal
range
thereafter
for
25
months
.

The
adverse
events
during
combined
therapy
with
cyclosporin
A
and
nifedipine
included
an
increase
in
blood
urea
nitrogen
levels
in
9
of
the
13
patients
and
development
of
gingival
hyperplasia
in
2
of
the
13
patients
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
sustained
-
release
nifedipine
is
useful
for
hypertensive
psoriatic
patients
under
long
-
term
treatment
with
cyclosporin
A
,
but
that
these
patients
should
be
monitored
for
gingival

.

Torsade

pointes

ventricular
tachycardia
during
low
dose
intermittent
dobutamine
treatment
in
a
patient
with

.

The
authors
describe
the
case
of
a
56-year
-
old
woman
with
chronic
,
severe
heart
failure
secondary
to
dilated
cardiomyopathy
and
absence
of
significant

who
developed
QT

pointes
ventricular
tachycardia
during
one
cycle
of
intermittent
low

(
2.5
mcg

)
dobutamine
.

This
report
of
torsade
de
pointes

ventricular
tachycardia
during
intermittent
dobutamine
supports
the
hypothesis
that
unpredictable
fatal
arrhythmias
may
occur
even
with
low
doses
and
in
patients
with
no
history
of
significant
rhythm
disturbances
.

The
mechanisms
of
proarrhythmic

of
Dubutamine
are
discussed

.

In
the
last
few
years
delayed
reactions
several
hours
after
the
injection
of
radiographic

contrast
materials

(
PRC
)
have
been
described
with
increasing
frequency
.

The
authors
report
two
observations
on
patients
with
delayed
reactions
in
whom
intradermoreactions
(
IDR
)
and
patch
tests
to
a
series
of
ionic
and
non
ionic
PRC
were
studied
.

After
angiography
by
the
venous
route
in
patient
n
degree
1
a
biphasic
reaction
with
an
immediate
reaction
(
dyspnea
,
loss
of
consciousness
)
and
delayed
macro
-
papular
rash
appeared
,
whilst
patient
n
degree
2
developed
a
generalised
sensation
of
heat
,
persistent
pain
at
the
site
of
injection
immediately
and
a
generalised
macro
-
papular
reaction
after
24
hours
.

The
skin
tests
revealed
positive
delayed
reactions
of
24
hours
and
48
hours
by
IDR
and
patch
tests
to
only
some
PRC
with
common
chains
in
their
structures
.

The
positive
skin
tests
are
in
favour
of
immunological
reactions
and
may
help
in
diagnosis
of
allergy
in
the
patients
.

Risk
of
transient
hyperammonemic
encephalopathy
in
cancer
patients
who
received
continuous
infusion
of
5-fluorouracil
with
the
complication
of
dehydration
and
infection
.

From
1986
to
1998
,
29
cancer
patients
who
had
32
episodes
of
transient
hyperammonemic
encephalopathy
related
to
continuous
infusion
of
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
were
identified
.

None
of
the
patients
had
decompensated
liver
disease
.

Onset
of
hyperammonemic
encephalopathy
varied
from
0.5
to
5
days
(
mean
:
2.6
+
/-

1.3
days
)
after
the
initiation
of
chemotherapy
.

Plasma
ammonium
level
ranged
from
248
to
2387
microg%
(
mean

:
626
+
/-

431
microg%
)
.

Among
the
32
episodes
,
26
(
81
%
)
had
various
degrees
of
azotemia
,
18
(
56
%
)
occurred
during
bacterial
infections
and
14
(
44
%
)
without

infection
occurred
during
periods
of
dehydration
.

Higher
plasma

ammonium
levels
and
more
rapid
onset
of
hyperammonemia
were
seen
in
18
patients
with
bacterial
infections
(
p=0.003
and
0.0006
,
respectively
)
and
in
nine
patients
receiving
high
daily
doses
(
2600
or
1800

mg
/
m2
)
of
5-FU

(
p=0.0001
and
0.0001
,
respectively
)
.

In
25
out
of
32
episodes
(
78
%
)
,
plasma
ammonium
levels
and
mental
status
returned
to
normal
within
2
days
after
adequate
management
.

In
conclusion
,
hyperammonemic
encephalopathy
can
occur
in
patients
receiving
continuous
infusion
of
5-FU
.

Azotemia
,
body
fluid
insufficiency
and
bacterial
infections
were
frequently
found
in
these
patients
.

It
is
therefore
important
to
recognize
this
condition
in
patients
receiving
continuous
infusion
of
5-FU
.

The

on

and
biphasic
changes
in

activity
induced
by
morphine

(
10

were

.

Quinine
is
known
to
block
voltage-

.

In
the
counterbalanced
method
,
quinine
attenuated
morphine
-induced

,
whereas
4-aminopyridine
was
ineffective
.

In
the
motor
activity
test
measured
with
an
Animex
-
activity
meter
neither
of
the
K
(
+
)
-channel

blockers
affected

morphine
-induced

hypoactivity
,
but
both
K
(
+
)

-channel
blockers
prevented
morphine
-induced
secondary
hyperactivity
.

3
.

These
results
suggest
the
involvement
of
quinine
-sensitive
but
not
4-aminopyridine
-sensitive
K
(
+
)
-channels
in
morphine
reward
.

It
is
also
suggested
that
the
blockade
of
K
(
+
)
-channels
sensitive
to
these
blockers
is
not
sufficient
to
prevent
morphine
-induced

hypoactivity
whereas

morphine
-induced

hyperactivity
seems
to
be
connected
to
both
quinine
-
and

Nociceptin
,
also
known
as
orphanin
FQ
,
is
an
endogenous
ligand
for
the
orphan
opioid
receptor
-
like
receptor
1
(
ORL1
)
and
involves
in
various
functions
in
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
nocistatin
is
recently
isolated
from
the
same
precursor
as
nociceptin
and
blocks
nociceptin
-induced
allodynia
and
hyperalgesia
.

2
.

Although
ORL1
receptors
which
display
a
high
degree
of
sequence
homology
with
classical
opioid
receptors
are
abundant
in
the
hippocampus
,
little
is
known
regarding
their
role
in
learning
and
memory
.

.

The
present
study
was
designed
to
investigate
whether
nociceptin
/
orphanin
FQ
and
nocistatin
could
modulate
impairment
of
learning
and

induced
by
scopolamine

These

that
nocistatin

,
ameliorates
impairments
of
spontaneous

Meloxicam
-induced
liver
toxicity
.

We
report
the
case
of
a
female
patient
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
who
developed
acute
cytolytic
hepatitis
due
to
meloxicam
.

Recently
introduced
in
Belgium
,
meloxicam
is
the
first
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drug
with
selective
action
on
the
inducible
form
of
cyclooxygenase
2
.

The
acute
cytolytic
hepatitis
occurred
rapidly
after
meloxicam
administration
and
was
associated
with
the
development
of
antinuclear
antibodies
suggesting
a
hypersensitivity
mechanism
.

This
first
case
of
meloxicam
related

liver
toxicity
demonstrates
the
potential
of
this

to
induce
hepatic

Induction
of

HL60
and
CD34+/CD19-
human
bone

progenitor
cells
:
potential
relevance
to
remoxipride
-induced
aplastic
anemia
.

The
antipsychotic
agent
,
remoxipride
[
(
S)-(-)-3-bromo
-
N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,6-dimethoxybenz
amide
]
has
been
associated
with
acquired
aplastic
anemia
.

We
have
examined
the
ability
of
remoxipride
,
three
pyrrolidine
ring
metabolites
and
five
aromatic
ring
metabolites
of
the
parent
compound
to
induce
apoptosis
in
HL60
cells
and
human
bone
marrow
progenitor
(
HBMP
)
cells
.

Cells
were
treated
for
0
-
24
h
with
each
compound
(
0
-
200
microM
)
.

Apoptosis
was
assessed
by
fluorescence
microscopy
in
Hoechst
33342
-
and
propidium
iodide
stained
cell
samples
.

Results
were
confirmed
by
determination
of
internucleosomal
DNA
fragmentation
using
gel
electrophoresis
for
HL60
cell
samples
and
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase
assay
in
HBMP
cells
.

The
catechol
and
hydroquinone
metabolites
,
NCQ436
and
NCQ344
,
induced
apoptosis
in
HL60
and
HBMP
cells
in
a
time-
and
concentration
dependent
manner
,
while
the
phenols
,
NCR181
,
FLA873
,
and
FLA797
,
and
the
derivatives
formed
by
oxidation
of
the
pyrrolidine
ring
,
FLA838
,
NCM001
,
and
NCL118
,
had
no
effect
.

No
necrosis
was
observed
in
cells
treated
with
NCQ436
but
NCQ344
had
a
biphasic
effect
in
both
cell
types
,
inducing
apoptosis
at
lower
concentrations
and
necrosis
at
higher
concentrations
.

These
data
show
that
the
catechol
and
hydroquinone
metabolites
of
remoxipride
have
direct
toxic
effects
in
HL60
and
HBMP
cells
,
leading
to
apoptosis
,
while
the
phenol
metabolites
were
inactive
.

Similarly
,
benzene
-derived

catechol
and
hydroquinone
,
but
not
phenol
,
induce
apoptosis

.

We
propose
that
remoxipride
and
benzene
may
induce
aplastic
anemia
via
production
of
similar
reactive
metabolites
and
that
the
ability
of
NCQ436
and
NCQ344
to
induce
apoptosis
in
HBMP
cells
may
contribute
to
the
mechanism
underlying

RATIONALE
:

NG
-
nitro

L
-
arginine

(
L

NOARG
)
,
an
inhibitor
of
nitric

oxide
synthase
(
NOS
)
,
induces
catalepsy
in
mice
.

This
effect
undergoes
rapid
tolerance
,
showing
a
significant
decrease
after
2
days
of
sub
-
chronic
L
-
NOARG
treatment
.

Nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
has
been
shown
to
influence
dopaminergic
neurotransmission
in
the
striatum
.

Neuroleptic
drugs
such
as
haloperidol
,
which
block
dopamine
receptors
,
also
cause
catalepsy
in
rodents
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
investigate
the
effects
of
subchronic
L
-
NOARG
treatment
in
haloperidol
-induced
catalepsy
and
the
number
of
NOS
neurons
in
areas
related
to
motor
control
.

METHODS
:

Male
albino
Swiss
mice
were
treated
sub
-
chronically
(
twice
a
day
for
4
days
)
with
L
-
NOARG

(
40
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
or
haloperidol
(
1
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
.

Catalepsy
was
evaluated
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
treatments
.

Reduced

nicotinamide
adenine

histochemistry
was
also
employed
to
visualize
NOS
as
an
index
of
enzyme
expression
in
mice
brain
regions
related
to
motor
control
.

RESULTS
:

L
-
NOARG
sub
-
chronic
administration
produced
tolerance
of
L
-
NOARG
and
of

haloperidol
-induced

catalepsy
.

It
also
induced
an
increase
in
the
number
of
NADPH
-d
-
positive
cells
in
the
dorsal
part
of
the
caudate
and
accumbens
nuclei
compared
with
haloperidol
and
in
the
pedunculopontine
tegmental
nucleus
compared
with
saline
.

In
contrast
,
there
was
a
decrease
in
NADPH

neuron
number
in
the
substantia
nigra
,
pars
compacta
in
both
haloperidol
-treated
and
L
-
NOARG
-treated
animals
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
results
give
further
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
NO
plays
a
role
in
motor
behavior
control
and
suggest
that
it
may
take
part
in
the
synaptic
changes
produced
by
antipsychotic
treatment

Prolonged

left
ventricular
dysfunction
occurs
in
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
after
both
dobutamine
and
exercise
induced
myocardial
ischaemia
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
determine
whether
pharmacological
stress
leads
to
prolonged
but
reversible
left
ventricular
dysfunction
in
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
,
similar
to
that
seen
after
exercise
.

DESIGN
:

A
randomised
crossover
study
of
recovery
time
of
systolic
and
diastolic
left
ventricular
function
after
exercise
and
dobutamine
induced

ischaemia
.

SUBJECTS
:
10
patients
with
stable
angina
,
angiographically
proven
coronary
artery
disease
,
and
normal
left
ventricular
function
.

INTERVENTIONS
:

Treadmill
exercise
and
dobutamine
stress
were
performed
on
different
days
.

Quantitative
assessment
of
systolic
and
diastolic
left
ventricular
function
was
performed
using
transthoracic
echocardiography
at
baseline
and
at
regular
intervals
after
each
test
.

RESULTS
:

Both
forms
of
stress
led
to
prolonged
but
reversible
systolic
and
diastolic
dysfunction
.

There
was
no
difference
in
the
maximum
double
product
(
p
=
0.53
)
or
ST
depression

(
p
=
0.63
)
with
either
form
of
stress
.

After
exercise
,
ejection
fraction
was
reduced
at
15
and
30
minutes
compared
with
baseline
(
mean
(
SEM
)

.

Regional
analysis
showed
a
reduction
in
the
worst
affected
segment
15
and
30
minutes
after
exercise
(
-27.9
(
7.2)%
and
-28.6
(

,
and
at
30
minutes
after
dobutamine

(
-32
(

)
.

The
isovolumic
relaxation
period
was
prolonged
45
minutes
after
each
form
of
stress
(
p
0.05
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
,
dobutamine
induced
ischaemia
results
in
prolonged
reversible
left
ventricular
dysfunction
,
presumed
to
be
myocardial
stunning
,
similar
to
that
seen
after
exercise
.

Dobutamine
induced

ischaemia
could
therefore
be
used
to
study
the
pathophysiology
of
this
phenomenon
further
in
patients
with
coronary
artery
disease
.

Anorexigens
and
pulmonary
hypertension
in
the
United
States
:
results
from
the
surveillance
of
North
American
pulmonary
hypertension
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
use
of
appetite
suppressants
in
Europe
has
been
associated
with
the
development
of
primary
pulmonary
hypertension

(
PPH
)
.

Recently
,
fenfluramine
appetite
suppressants
became
widely
used
in
the
United
States
but
were
withdrawn
in
September
1997
because
of
concerns
over
adverse
effects
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS

:
We
conducted
a
prospective
surveillance
study
on
patients
diagnosed
with
pulmonary
hypertension
at
12
large
referral
centers
in
North
America
.

Data
collected
on
patients
seen
from
September
1
,
1996
,
to
December
31
,
1997
,
included
the
cause
of
the
pulmonary
hypertension
and
its
severity
.

Patients
with
no
identifiable
cause
of
pulmonary
hypertension
were
classed
as
PPH
.

A
history
of
drug
exposure
also
was
taken
with
special
attention
on
the
use
of
antidepressants
,
anorexigens
,
and
amphetamines
.

RESULTS
:

Five
hundred
seventy
-
nine
patients
were
studied
,
205
with
PPH
and
374
with
pulmonary
hypertension
from
other
causes
(
secondary
pulmonary
hypertension
[
SPH
]
)
.

The
use
of
anorexigens
was
common
in
both
groups
.

However
,
of
the
medications
surveyed
,
only
the
fenfluramines
had
a
significant
preferential
association
with
PPH
as
compared
with
SPH
(
adjusted
odds
ratio
for
use
>
6
months
,
7.5
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
1.7
to
32.4
)
.

The
association
was
stronger
with
longer
duration
of
use
when
compared
to
shorter
duration
of
use
and
was
more
pronounced
in
recent
users
than
in
remote
users
.

An
unexpectedly
high
(
11.4
%
)
number
of
patients
with
SPH
had
used
anorexigens
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
magnitude
of
the
association
with
PPH
,
the
increase
of
association
with
increasing
duration
of
use
,
and
the
specificity
for
fenfluramines
are
consistent
with
previous
studies
indicating
that
fenfluramines
are
causally
related
to
PPH
.

The
high
prevalence
of
anorexigen
use
in
patients
with
SPH
also
raises
the
possibility
that
these
drugs
precipitate
pulmonary
hypertension
in
patients
with
underlying
conditions
associated
with
SPH
.

Clinical
aspects
of
heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
and
thrombosis
and
other
side
effects
of
heparin
therapy
.

Heparin
,
first
used
to
prevent
the
clotting
of
blood
in
vitro
,
has
been
clinically
used
to
treat
thrombosis
for
more
than
50
years
.

Although
several
new
anticoagulant
drugs
are
in
development
,
heparin
remains
the
anticoagulant
of
choice
to
treat
acute
thrombotic
episodes
.

The
clinical
effects
of
heparin
are
meritorious
,
but
side
effects
do
exist
.

Bleeding
is
the
primary
untoward
effect
of
heparin
.

Major
bleeding
is
of
primary
concern
in
patients
receiving
heparin
therapy
.

However
,
additional
important
untoward
effects
of
heparin
therapy
include

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia
,
heparin

-associated

osteoporosis
,
eosinophilia
,
skin
reactions
,
allergic
reactions
other
than
thrombocytopenia
,
alopecia
,
transaminasemia
,
hyperkalemia
,
hypoaldosteronism
,
and
priapism
.

These
side
effects
are
relatively
rare
in
a
given
individual
,
but
given
the
extremely
widespread
use
of
heparin
,
some
are
quite
common
,
particularly
HITT
and
osteoporosis
.

Although
reasonable
incidences
of
many
of
these
side
effects
can
be
"
softly
"
deduced
from
current
reports
dealing
with
unfractionated
heparin
,
at
present
the
incidences
of
these
side
effects
with
newer
low
molecular
weight
heparins
appear
to
be
much
less
common
.

However
,
only
longer
experience
will
more
clearly
define
the
incidence
of
each
side
effect
with
low
molecular
weight
preparations
.

A
case
of
bilateral
optic
neuropathy
in
a
patient
on
tacrolimus

(
FK506
)
therapy
after
liver
transplantation
.

PURPOSE
:

To
report
a
case
of
bilateral
optic
neuropathy
in
a
patient
receiving
tacrolimus

(
FK
506
,
Prograf
;
Fujisawa
USA
,
Inc
,
Deerfield
,
Illinois
)
for
immunosuppression
after
orthotropic
liver
transplantation
.

METHOD
:

Case
report
.

In
a
58-year
-
old
man
receiving
tacrolimus
after
orthotropic
liver
transplantation
,
serial
neuro
-
ophthalmologic
examinations
and
laboratory
studies
were
performed
.

RESULTS
:

The
patient
had
episodic
deterioration
of
vision
in
both
eyes
,
with
clinical
features
resembling
ischemic
optic
neuropathies
.

Deterioration
of
vision
occurred
despite
discontinuation
of
the
tacrolimus
.

CONCLUSION
:

Tacrolimus
and
other
immunosuppressive
agents
may
be
associated
with
optic
nerve
toxicity
.

Hypercalcemia
,
arrhythmia
,
and
mood
stabilizers
.

Recent
findings
in
a
bipolar
patient
receiving
maintenance
lithium
therapy
who
developed
hypercalcemia
and
severe
bradyarrhythmia
prompted
the
authors
to
conduct
a
retrospective
study
of
bipolar
patients
with
lithium

-associated

hypercalcemia
.

A
printout
of
all
cases
of
hypercalcemia
that
presented
during
a
1-year
period
was
generated
.

After
eliminating
spurious
hypercalcemias
or
those
associated
with
intravenous
fluids
,
the
authors
identified
18
non-
lithium
-treated
patients
with
hypercalcemias
related
to
malignancies
and
other
medical
conditions
(
group
A
)
and
12
patients
with
lithium

-associated

hypercalcemia
(
group
B
)
.

Patients
in
group
B
were
not
comparable
to
those
in
group
A
,
as
the
latter
were
medically
compromised
and
were
receiving
multiple
pharmacotherapies
.

Thus
,
two
control
groups
were
generated
:
group
C1
,
which
included
age-
and
sex
-
comparable
lithium
-treated
bipolar
normocalcemic
patients
,
and
group
C2
,
which
included
bipolar
normocalcemic
patients
treated
with
anticonvulsant
mood
stabilizers
.

The
electrocardiographic
(
ECG
)
findings
for
patients
in
group
B
were
compared
with
those
of
patients
in
groups
C1
and
C2
.

It
was
found
that
these
groups
did
not
differ
in
their
overall
frequency
of
ECG
abnormalities
;
however
,
there
were
significant
differences
in
the
frequency
of
conduction
defects
.

Patients
with
hypercalcemia
resulting
from
medical
diseases
and
bipolar
patients
with
lithium

-associated

hypercalcemia
had
significantly
higher
frequencies
of
conduction
defects
.

Patients
in
group
A
had
significant
mortality
at
2-year
follow
-
up
(
28
%
)
,
in
contrast
to
zero
mortality
in
the
other
three
groups
.

The
clinical
implications
of
these
findings
are
discussed
.

Attenuation
of
nephrotoxicity
by
a
novel
lipid
nanosphere
(
NS-718
)
incorporating
amphotericin
B
.

NS-718
,
a
lipid
nanosphere
incorporating
amphotericin
B
,
is
effective
against
pathogenic
fungi
and
has
low
toxicity
.

We
compared
the
toxicity
of
NS-718
with
that
of
Fungizone

(
amphotericin
B
-
sodium
deoxycholate
;
D
-
AmB
)
in
vitro
using
renal
cell
cultures
and
in
vivo
by
biochemical
analysis
,
histopathological
study
of
the
kidney
and
pharmacokinetic
study
of
amphotericin
B
following
intravenous
infusion
of
the
formulation
in
rats
.

Incubation
with
NS-718
resulted
in
significantly
less
damage
of
cultured
human
renal
proximal
tubular
epithelial
cells
compared
with
D
-
AmB
.

Serum
blood
urea
and
creatinine
concentrations
increased
significantly
in
rats
given
an
iv
infusion
of
D
-
AmB
3
mg
/
kg
but
not
in
those
given
the
same
dose
of
NS-718
.

Histopathological
examination
of
the
kidney
showed
tubular
necrosis
in
D
-
AmB
-treated
rats
but
no
change
in
NS-718-treated
rats
.

Amphotericin
B
concentrations
in
the
kidney
in
NS-718-treated
rats
were
higher
than
those
in
D
-
AmB
-treated
rats
.

Our
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
results
suggest
that
incorporation
of
amphotericin
B
into
lipid
nanospheres
of
NS-718
attenuates
the
nephrotoxicity
of
amphotericin
B
.

Patterns
of
sulfadiazine
acute
nephrotoxicity
.

Sulfadiazine

acute
nephrotoxicity
is
reviving
specially
because
of
its
use
in
toxoplasmosis
in
HIV
-
positive
patients
.

We
report
4
cases
,
one
of
them
in
a
previously
healthy
person
.

Under
treatment
with
sulfadiazine

they
developed
oliguria
,
abdominal
pain
,
renal
failure
and
showed
multiple
radiolucent
renal
calculi
in
echography
.

All
patients
recovered
their
previous
normal
renal
function
after
adequate
hydration
and
alcalinization
.

A
nephrostomy
tube
had
to
be
placed
in
one
of
the
patients
for
ureteral
lithiasis
in
a
single
functional
kidney
.

None
of
them
needed
dialysis
or
a
renal
biopsy
because
of
a
typical
benign
course
.

Treatment
with
sulfadiazine
requires
exquisite
control
of
renal
function
,
an
increase
in
water
ingestion
and
possibly
the
alcalinization
of
the
urine
.

We
communicate
a
case
in
a
previously
healthy
person
,
a
fact
not
found
in
the
recent
literature
.

Probably
many
more
cases
are
not
detected
.

We
think
that
a
prospective
study
would
be
useful
.

Downbeat
nystagmus
associated
with
intravenous
patient
-
controlled
administration
of
morphine
.

IMPLICATIONS
:

This
case
documents
a
patient
who
developed
dizziness
with
downbeating
nystagmus
while
receiving
a
relatively
large
dose
of
IV
patient
-
controlled
analgesia
morphine
.

Although
there
have
been
case
reports
of
epidural
morphine
with
these
symptoms
and
signs
,
this
has
not
been
previously
documented
with
IV
or
patient
-
controlled
analgesia
morphine
.

Hemodynamic
and
antiadrenergic
effects
of
dronedarone
and
amiodarone
in
animals
with
a
healed
myocardial
infarction
.

The
hemodynamic
and
antiadrenergic
effects
of
dronedarone
,
a
noniodinated
compound
structurally
related
to
amiodarone
,
were
compared
with
those
of
amiodarone
after
prolonged
oral
administration
,
both
at
rest
and
during
sympathetic
stimulation
in
conscious
dogs
with
a
healed
myocardial
infarction
.

All
dogs
(
n
=
6
)
randomly
received
orally
dronedarone

(
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
,
amiodarone

(
10
and
30
mg
/
kg
)
,
and
placebo
twice
daily
for
7
days
,
with
a
3-week
washout
between
consecutive
treatments
.

Heart
rate
(
HR
)
,
mean
arterial
pressure
(
MBP
)
,
positive
rate
of
increase
of
left
ventricular
pressure
(
+
LVdP
/
dt
)
,
echocardiographically
assessed
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(
LVEF
)
,
and
fractional
shortening
(
FS
)
,
as
well
as
chronotropic
response
to
isoproterenol
and
exercise
-
induced
sympathetic
stimulation
were
evaluated
under
baseline
and
posttreatment
conditions
.

Resting
values
of
LVEF
,
FS
,
+
LVdP
/
dt
,
and
MBP
remained
unchanged
whatever
the
drug
and
the
dosing
regimen
,
whereas
resting
HR
was
significantly
and
dose
-
dependently
lowered
after
dronedarone
and
to
a
lesser
extent
after
amiodarone
.

Both
dronedarone
and
amiodarone
significantly
reduced
the
exercise
-
induced
tachycardia
and
,
at
the
highest
dose
,
decreased
the
isoproterenol
-induced
tachycardia
.

Thus
,
dronedarone
and
amiodarone
displayed
a
similar
level
of
antiadrenergic
effect
and
did
not
impair
the
resting
left
ventricular
function
.

Consequently
,
dronedarone
might
be
particularly
suitable
for
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
various
clinical
arrhythmias
,
without
compromising
the
left
ventricular
function
.

RESULTS
:

A
total
of
49
patients
(

BACKGROUND
:

We
compared
the
efficacy
and

for
the
treatment
of
acute
bipolar

.

METHODS
:

Four

.

A
total
of
115
patients
with

.

The
primary
efficacy
measure
was
the
Young-

.

Response
and
euthymia
were
defined
,
a

The
effect
of
pupil
dilation
with
tropicamide
on
vision
and
driving
simulator
performance
.

PURPOSE
:
To
assess
the
effect
of
pupil
dilation
on
vision
and
driving
ability
.

METHODS
:

A
series
of
tests
on
various
parameters
of
visual
function
and
driving
simulator
performance
were
performed
on
12
healthy
drivers
,
before
and
after
pupil
dilation
using
guttae

tropicamide
1
%
.

A
driving
simulator
(
Transport
Research
Laboratory
)
was
used
to
measure
reaction
time
(
RT
)
,
speed
maintenance
and
steering
accuracy
.

Tests
of
basic
visual
function
included
high-
and
low
-
contrast
visual
acuity
(
HCVA
and
LCVA
)

,
Pelli
-
Robson
contrast
threshold
(
CT
)
and
Goldmann
perimetry
(
FIELDS
)
.

Useful
Field
of
View
(
UFOV
--
a
test
of
visual
attention
)
was
also
undertaken
.

The
mean
differences
in
the
pre-
and
post
-
dilatation
measurements
were
tested
for
statistical
significance
at
the
95
%
level
using
one
-
tail
paired
t
-
tests
.

RESULTS
:

Pupillary
dilation
resulted
in
a
statistically
significant
deterioration
in
CT
and
HCVA
only
.

Five
of
12
drivers
also
exhibited
deterioration
in
LCVA
,
CT
and
RT
.

Little
evidence
emerged
for
deterioration
in
FIELDS
and
UFOV
.

Also
,
7
of
12
drivers
appeared
to
adjust
their
driving
behaviour
by
reducing
their
speed
on
the
driving
simulator
,
leading
to
improved
steering
accuracy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Pupillary
dilation
may
lead
to
a
decrease
in
vision
and
daylight
driving
performance
in
young
people
.

A
larger
study
,
including
a
broader
spectrum
of
subjects
,
is
warranted
before
guidelines
can
be
recommended
.

A

)
due
to
exposure
to

.

In
this
paper
we
aim

Effect
of
methoxamine
on
maximum
urethral
pressure
in
women
with
genuine
stress
incontinence
:
a
placebo
-
controlled
,
double
-
blind
crossover
study
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
evaluate
the
potential
role
for
a
selective
alpha1-adrenoceptor
agonist
in
the
treatment
of
urinary
stress
incontinence
.

A
randomised
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
,
crossover
study
design
was
employed
.

Half
log
incremental
doses
of
intravenous
methoxamine
or
placebo
(
saline
)
were
administered
to
a
group
of
women
with
genuine
stress
incontinence
while
measuring
maximum
urethral
pressure
(
MUP
)
,
blood
pressure
,
heart
rate
,
and
symptomatic
side
effects
.

Methoxamine
evoked
non
-
significant
increases
in
MUP
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
but
caused
a
significant
rise
in
systolic
blood
pressure
and
significant
fall
in
heart
rate
at
maximum
dosage
.

Systemic
side
effects
including
piloerection
,
headache
,
and
cold
extremities
were
experienced
in
all
subjects
.

The
results
indicate
that
the
clinical
usefulness
of
direct
,
peripherally
acting
sub
-
type
-
selective
alpha1-adrenoceptor
agonists
in
the
medical
treatment
of
stress
incontinence
may
be
limited
by
associated
piloerection
and
cardiovascular
side
effects
.

Toleration

The
Assessment
of
Treatment
with
Lisinopril
and
Survival
.

BACKGROUND
:

Treatment
with
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitors

reduces
mortality
and
morbidity
in
patients
with
chronic
heart
failure

(
CHF
)
,
but
most
affected
patients
are
not
receiving
these
agents
or
are
being
treated
with
doses
lower
than
those
found
to
be
efficacious
in
trials
,
primarily
because
of
concerns
about
the
safety
and
tolerability
of
these
agents
,
especially
at
the
recommended
doses
.

The
present
study
examines
the
safety
and
tolerability
of
high-
compared
with
low
-
dose
lisinopril
in
CHF
.

METHODS
:

The
Assessment
of
Lisinopril
and
Survival
study
was
a
multicenter
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
trial
in
which
patients
with
or
without
previous
ACE
inhibitor
treatment
were
stabilized
receiving
medium
-
dose
lisinopril
(
12.5
or
15.0
mg
once
daily
[
OD
]
)
for
2
to
4
weeks
and
then
randomized
to
high-
(
35.0
or
32.5
mg
OD
)
or
low
-
dose
(
5.0
or
2.5
mg
OD
)
groups
.

Patients
with
New
York
Heart
Association
classes
II
to
IV
CHF
and
left
ventricular
ejection
fractions
of
no
greater
than
0.30
(
n
=
3164
)
were
randomized
and
followed
up
for
a
median
of
46
months
.

We
examined
the
occurrence
of
adverse
events
and
the
need
for
discontinuation
and
dose
reduction
during
treatment
,
with
a
focus
on
hypotension
and
renal
dysfunction
.

RESULTS
:

Of
405
patients
not
previously
receiving
an
ACE
inhibitor
,
doses
in
only
4.2
%
could
not
be
titrated
to
the
medium
doses
required
for
randomization
because
of
symptoms
possibly
related
to
hypotension
(
2.0
%
)
or
because
of
renal
dysfunction
or
hyperkalemia
(
2.3
%
)
.

Doses
in
more
than
90
%
of
randomized
patients
in
the
high-
and
low
-
dose
groups
were
titrated
to
their
assigned
target
,
and
the
mean
doses
of
blinded
medication
in
both
groups
remained
similar
throughout
the
study
.

Withdrawals
occurred
in
27.1
%
of
the
high-
and
30.7
%
of
the
low
-
dose
groups
.

Subgroups
presumed
to
be
at
higher
risk
for
ACE
inhibitor
intolerance
(

)
generally
tolerated
the
high

strategy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
findings
demonstrate
that
ACE
inhibitor
therapy
in
most
patients
with
CHF
can
be
successfully
titrated
to
and
maintained
at
high
doses
,
and
that
more
aggressive
use
of
these
agents
is
warranted

Cocaine
,
ethanol
,
and
cocaethylene

cardiotoxity
in
an
animal
model
of
cocaine
and
ethanol
abuse
.

OBJECTIVES
:

Simultaneous
abuse
of
cocaine
and
ethanol
affects
12
million
Americans
annually
.

In
combination
,
these
substances
are
substantially
more
toxic
than
either
drug
alone
.

Their
combined
cardiac
toxicity
may
be
due
to
independent
effects
of
each
drug
;
however
,
they
may
also
be
due
to
cocaethylene

(
CE
)
,
a
cocaine
metabolite
formed
only
in
the
presence
of
ethanol
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
delineate
the
role
of
CE
in
the
combined
cardiotoxicity
of
cocaine
and
ethanol
in
a
model
simulating
their
abuse
.

METHODS
:

Twenty

three
dogs
were
randomized
to
receive

.

Hemodynamic
measurements
,
electrocardiograms
,
and
serum
drug
concentrations
were
obtained
at
baseline
,
and
then
at
fixed
time
intervals
after
each
drug
was
administered
.

RESULTS
:

Two
of
eight
dogs
in
the
C+E
group
experienced
cardiovascular
collapse
.

The
most
dramatic
hemodynamic
changes
occurred
after
each
cocaine
bolus
in
the
C+E
and
C
only
groups
;
however
,
persistent
hemodynamic
changes
occurred
in
the
C+E
group
.

.

Ventricular
arrhythmias
were
primarily
observed
in
the
C+E
group
,
in
which
four
of
eight
dogs
experienced
ventricular
tachycardia
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Cocaine
and
ethanol
in
combination
were
more
toxic
than
either
substance
alone
.

Co
-
administration
resulted
in
prolonged
cardiac
toxicity
and
was
dysrhythmogenic
.

Peak

Worsening
of
Parkinsonism
after
the
use
of
veralipride
for
treatment
of
menopause
:
case
report
.

We
describe
a
female
patient
with
stable
Parkinson
's
disease
who
has
shown
a
marked
worsening
of
her
motor
functions
following
therapy
of
menopause
related
symptoms
with
veralipride
,
as
well
as
the
improvement
of
her
symptoms
back
to
baseline
after
discontinuation
of
the
drug
.

We
emphasize
the
anti
-
dopaminergic
effect
of
veralipride
.

Viracept
and
irregular
heartbeat
warning
.

A
group
of
doctors
in
Boston
warn
that
the
protease
inhibitor
Viracept
may
cause
an
irregular
heart
beat
,
known
as
bradycardia
,
in
people
with
HIV
.

Bradycardia
occurred
in
a
45-year
-
old
male
patient
who
was
Viracept
in
combination
with
other
anti
-
HIV
drugs
.

The
symptoms
ceased
after
switching
to
another

Frequency
of
appearance
of
myeloperoxidase
-
antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody
(
MPO
-
ANCA
)
in
Graves
'
disease
patients
treated
with
propylthiouracil
and
the
relationship
between
MPO
-
ANCA
and
clinical
manifestations
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Myeloperoxidase
antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody
(
MPO
-
ANCA)-positive
vasculitis
has
been
reported
in
patients
with
Graves
'
disease
who
were
treated
with
propylthiouracil

(
PTU
)
.

The
appearance
of
MPO
-
ANCA
in
these
cases
was
suspected
of
being
related
to
PTU
because
the
titres
of
MPO
-
ANCA
decreased
when
PTU
was
stopped
.

Nevertheless
,
there
have
been
no
studies
on
the
temporal
relationship
between
the
appearance
of
MPO
-
ANCA
and
vasculitis
during
PTU
therapy
,
or
on
the
incidence
of
MPO
-
ANCA
in
untreated
Graves
'
disease
patients
.

Therefore
,
we
sought
to
address
these
parameters
in
patients
with
Graves
'
disease
.

PATIENTS
:

We
investigated
102
untreated
patients
with
hyperthyroidism
due
to
Graves
'
disease
for
the
presence
of
MPO
-
ANCA
,
and
for
the
development
vasculitis
after
starting
PTU
therapy
.

Twenty
-
nine
of
them
were
later
excluded
because
of
adverse
effects
of
PTU
or
because
the
observation
period
was
less
than
3
months
.

The
remaining
73
patients
(
55
women
and
18
men
)
,
all
of
whom
were
examined
for
more
than
3
months
,
were
adopted
as
the
subjects
of
the
investigation
.

The
median
observation
period
was
23.6
months
(
range
:
3
-
37
months
)
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
MPO
-
ANCA
was
measured
at
intervals
of
2
-
6
months
.

RESULTS
:

Before

,
the
MPO

Three
(
4.1
%
)
of
the
73
patients
were
positive
for
MPO
-
ANCA
at
13
,
16
and
17
months
,
respectively
,
after
the
start
of
PTU
therapy
.

In
two
of
them
,
the
MPO
-
ANCA
titres
transiently
increased
to
12.8
and
15.0
U
/
ml
,
respectively
,
despite
continued
PTU
therapy
,
but
no
vasculitic
disorders
developed
.

In
the
third
patient
,
the
MPO
-
ANCA
titre
increased
to
204
U
/
ml
and
she
developed
a
higher
fever
,
oral
ulcers
and
polyarthralgia
,
but
the
symptoms
resolved
2
weeks
after
stopping
PTU
therapy
,
and
the
MPO
-
ANCA
titre
decreased
to
20.7
U
/
ml
by
4
months
after
discontinuing
PTU
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

PTU
therapy
may
be
related
to
the
appearance
of
MPO
-
ANCA
,
but
MPO
-
ANCA
does
not
appear
to
be
closely
related
to
vasculitis
.

Prevalence
of
heart
disease
in
asymptomatic
chronic
cocaine
users
.

To
determine
the
prevalence
of
heart
disease
in
outpatient
young
asymptomatic
chronic
cocaine
users
,
35
cocaine
users
and
32
age
-
matched
controls
underwent
resting
and
exercise
electrocardiography
(
ECG
)
and
Doppler
echocardiography
.

Findings
consistent
with
coronary
artery
disease
were
detected
in
12
(
34
%
)
patients
and
3
(
9
%
)
controls
(
p
=
0.01
)
.

Decreased
left
ventricular
systolic
function
was
demonstrated
in
5
(
14
%
)
patients
,
but
in
none
of
the
controls
(
p
=
0.055
)
.

Finally
,
resting
and
peak
exercise

abnormal
left
ventricular
filling
was
detected
in
38
and
35
%
of
patients
as
compared
to
19
and
9
%
of
controls
,
respectively
(
p
=
0.11
and
0.02
,
respectively
)
.

We
conclude
that
coronary
artery
or
myocardial
disease
is
common
(
38
%
)
in
young
asymptomatic
chronic
cocaine
users
.

Therefore
,
screening
ECG
and
echocardiography
may
be
warranted
in
these
patients
.

Cardioprotective
effects
of
Picrorrhiza
kurroa
against
isoproterenol
-induced

.

The
cardioprotective

of
the
ethanol
extract
of
Picrorrhiza
kurroa
rhizomes
and
roots
(
PK
)
on
isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial
infarction
in
rats
with
respect
to
lipid
metabolism
in

has
been
investigated
.

Oral
pre
-
treatment
with
PK
(
80
mg
kg(-1
)
day(-1
)
for
15
days
)
significantly
prevented
the
isoproterenol
-induced

myocardial

and
maintained
the
rats
at
near

status
.

Phase
2
early
afterdepolarization
as
a
trigger
of
polymorphic
ventricular
tachycardia
in
acquired
long
-
QT
syndrome
:
direct
evidence
from
intracellular
recordings
in
the
intact
left
ventricular
wall
.

BACKGROUND
:

This
study
examined
the
role
of
phase
2
early
afterdepolarization
(
EAD
)
in
producing
a
trigger
to
initiate
torsade
de
pointes

(
TdP
)
with

QT
prolongation
induced
by
dl-
sotalol
and
azimilide
.

The
contribution
of
transmural
dispersion
of
repolarization
(
TDR
)
to
transmural
propagation
of
EAD
and
the
maintenance
of
TdP
was
also
evaluated
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:

Transmembrane
action
potentials
from
epicardium
,
midmyocardium
,
and
endocardium
were
recorded
simultaneously
,
together
with
a
transmural
ECG
,
in
arterially
perfused
canine
and
rabbit
left
ventricular
preparations
.

dl-

Sotalol
preferentially
prolonged
action
potential
duration
(
APD
)
in
M
cells
dose
-
dependently
(
1
to
100
micromol
/
L
)
,
leading
to
QT
prolongation
and
an
increase
in
TDR
.

Azimilide
,
however
,
significantly
prolonged
APD
and
QT
interval
at
concentrations
from
0.1
to
10
micromol
/

L
but
shortened
them
at
30
micromol
/

L.
Unlike
dl-
sotalol
,

azimilide

(
>
3
micromol
/
L
)
increased
epicardial
APD
markedly
,
causing
a
diminished
TDR
.

Although
both
dl-
sotalol
and
azimilide
rarely
induced
EADs
in
canine
left
ventricles
,
they
produced
frequent
EADs
in
rabbits
,
in
which
more
pronounced
QT
prolongation
was
seen
.

An
increase
in
TDR
by
dl-
sotalol
facilitated
transmural
propagation
of
EADs
that
initiated
multiple
episodes
of
spontaneous
TdP
in
3
of
6
rabbit
left
ventricles
.

Of
note
,
although
azimilide
(
3
to
10
micromol
/
L
)
increased
APD
more
than
dl-
sotalol
,
its
EADs
often
failed
to
propagate
transmurally
,
probably
because
of
a
diminished
TDR
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
study
provides
the
first
direct
evidence
from
intracellular
action
potential
recordings
that
phase
2
EAD
can
be
generated
from
intact
ventricular
wall
and
produce
a
trigger
to
initiate
the
onset
of
TdP
under
QT
prolongation
.

Prenatal
cocaine
exposure
and
cranial
sonographic
findings
in
preterm
infants
.

PURPOSE
:

Prenatal
cocaine
exposure
has
been
linked
with
subependymal
hemorrhage
and
the
formation
of
cysts

that
are
detectable
on
cranial
sonography
in
neonates
born
at
term
.

We
sought
to
determine
if
prenatal
cocaine

exposure
increases
the
incidence
of
subependymal
cysts
in
preterm
infants
.

METHODS
:
We
retrospectively
reviewed
the
medical
records
and
cranial
sonograms
obtained
during
a
1-year
period
on
122
premature
(
36
weeks
of
gestation
)
infants
.

Infants
were
categorized
into
1
of
2
groups
:
those
exposed
to
cocaine
and
those
not
exposed
to
cocaine
.

Infants
were
assigned
to
the
cocaine
-exposed
group
if
there
was
a
maternal
history
of
cocaine
abuse
during
pregnancy
or
if
maternal
or
neonatal
urine
toxicology
results
were
positive
at
the
time
of
delivery
.

RESULTS
:

Five
of
the
122
infants
were
excluded
from
the
study
because
of
insufficient
medical
and
drug
histories
.

The
incidence
of
subependymal
cysts
in
the
117
remaining
infants
was
14
%
(
16
of
117
)
.

The
incidence
of
subependymal
cysts
in
infants
exposed
to
cocaine

prenatally
was
44
%
(
8
of
18
)
compared
with
8
%
(
8
of
99
)
in
the
unexposed
group
(
p
0.01
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

We
found
an
increased
incidence
of
subependymal
cyst
formation
in
preterm
infants
who
were
exposed
to
cocaine

prenatally
.

This
result
is
consistent
with
results
of
similar
studies
in
term
infants
.

Thalidomide

neuropathy
in
patients
treated
for
metastatic
prostate
cancer
.

We
prospectively
evaluated

thalidomide
-induced
neuropathy
using
electrodiagnostic
studies
.

Sixty
-
seven
men
with
metastatic
androgen
-independent

prostate
cancer
in
an
open
-
label
trial
of
oral
thalidomide
underwent
neurologic
examinations
and
nerve
conduction
studies
(
NCS
)
prior
to
and
at
3-month
intervals
during
treatment
.

NCS
included
recording
of
sensory
nerve
action
potentials
(
SNAPs
)
from
median
,
radial
,
ulnar
,
and
sural
nerves
.

SNAP
amplitudes
for
each
nerve
were
expressed
as
the
percentage
of
its
baseline
,
and
the
mean
of
the
four
was
termed
the
SNAP
index
.

A
40
%
decline
in
the
SNAP
index
was
considered
clinically
significant
.

Thalidomide
was
discontinued
in
55
patients
for
lack
of
therapeutic
response
.

Of
67
patients
initially
enrolled
,
24
remained
on
thalidomide
for
3
months
,
8
remained
at
6
months
,
and
3
remained
at
9
months
.

Six
patients
developed
neuropathy
.

Clinical
symptoms
and
a
decline
in
the
SNAP
index
occurred
concurrently
.

Older
age
and
cumulative
dose
were
possible
contributing
factors
.

Neuropathy
may
thus
be
a
common
complication
of
thalidomide
in
older
patients
.

The
SNAP
index
can
be
used
to
monitor
peripheral
neuropathy
,
but
not
for
early
detection
.

Overexpression
of
copper
/
zinc
-
superoxide
dismutase
protects
from
kanamycin

-induced

hearing
loss
.

The
participation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
in
aminoglycoside
-induced

ototoxicity
has
been
deduced
from
observations
that
aminoglycoside
-
iron
complexes
catalyze
the
formation
of
superoxide
radicals
in
vitro
and
that
antioxidants
attenuate

ototoxicity
in
vivo
.

We
therefore
hypothesized
that
overexpression
of
Cu
/
Zn
-
superoxide
dismutase
(
h
-
SOD1
)
should
protect
transgenic
mice
from
ototoxicity
.

Immunocytochemistry
confirmed
expression
of
h
-
SOD1
in
inner
ear
tissues
of
transgenic
C57BL/6-TgN[SOD1]3Cje
mice
.

Transgenic
and
nontransgenic
littermates
received
kanamycin

(
400
mg
/
kg
body
weight
/
day
)
for
10
days
beginning
on
day
10
after
birth
.

Auditory
thresholds
were
tested
by
evoked
auditory
brain
stem
responses
at
1
month
after
birth
.

In
nontransgenic
animals
,
the
threshold
in
the
kanamycin
-treated
group
was
45
-
50
dB
higher
than
in
saline
-
injected
controls
.

In
the
transgenic
group
,
kanamycin
increased
the
threshold
by
only
15
dB
over
the
respective
controls
.

The
effects
were
similar
at
12
and
24
kHz
.

The
protection
by
overexpression
of
superoxide
dismutase
supports
the
hypothesis
that
oxidant
stress
plays
a
significant
role
in
aminoglycoside

-induced
ototoxicity
.

The
results
also
suggest
transgenic
animals
as
suitable
models
to
investigate
the
underlying
mechanisms
and
possible
strategies
for
prevention
.

Prednisone
induces

anxiety
and
glial
cerebral
changes
in
rats
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
assess
whether
prednisone

(
PDN
)
produces
anxiety
and/or
cerebral
glial
changes
in
rats
.

METHODS
:

Male
Wistar
rats
were
studied
and
3
groups
were
formed
(
8
rats
per
group
)
.

The
moderate
-
dose
group
received
5
mg
/
kg
/
day
PDN
released
from
a
subcutaneous
implant
.

In
the
high
-
dose
group
,
implants
containing
PDN
equivalent
to
60
mg
/
kg
/
day
were
applied
.

In
the
control
group
implants
contained
no
PDN
.

Anxiety
was
assessed
using
an
open
field
and
elevated
plus
-
maze
devices
.

The
number
of
cells
and
cytoplasmic
transformation
of
astrocytes
and
microglia
cells
were
assessed
by
immunohistochemical
analyses
.

RESULTS
:

Anxiety
was
documented
in
both
groups
of

PDN
treated
rats
compared
with
controls
.

The
magnitude
of
transformation
of
the
microglia
assessed
by
the
number
of
intersections
was
significantly
higher
in
the
PDN
groups
than
in
controls
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
(
moderate
-
dose
,
24.1
;
high
-
dose
,
23.6
;
controls
18.7
;
p
0.01
)
and
striatum
(
moderate

dose
25.6
;
high
-
dose
26.3
;
controls
18.9
;
p
0.01
)
,
but
not
in
hippocampus
.

The
number
of
stained
microglia
cells
was
significantly
higher
in
the
PDN
treated
groups
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
than
in
controls
(
moderate
-
dose
,
29.1
;
high
-
dose
,
28.4
;
control
,
17.7
cells
per
field
;
p
0.01
)
.

Stained
microglia
cells
were
significantly
more
numerous
striatum
and
hippocampus
in
the
high
-
dose
group
compared
to
controls
.

CONCLUSION
:

Subacute
exposure
to
PDN
induced

anxiety
and
reactivity
of
microglia
.

The
relevance
of
these
features
for
patients
using
PDN
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Phase
II
study
of
carboplatin
and
liposomal
doxorubicin
in
patients
with
recurrent
squamous
cell
carcinoma
of
the
cervix
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
activity
of
the
combination
of
carboplatin
and
liposomal
doxorubicin
was
tested
in
a
Phase
II
study
of
patients
with
recurrent
cervical
carcinoma
.

METHODS
:

The
combination
of
carboplatin

(
area
under
the
concentration
curve
[
AUC
]
,
5
)
and
liposomal
doxorubicin

(
Doxil
;
starting
dose
,
40
mg
/
m(2
)
)
was
administered
intravenously
every
28
days
to
37
patients
with
recurrent
squamous
cell
cervical
carcinoma
to
determine
antitumor
activity
and
toxicity
profile
.

RESULTS
:

Twenty
-
nine
patients
were
assessable
for
response
,
and
35
patients
were
assessable
for
toxicity
.

The
overall
response
rate
was
38
%
,
the
median
time
to
response
was
10
weeks
,
the
median
duration
of
response
was
26
weeks
,
and
the
median
survival
was
37
weeks
.

The
main
toxic
effect
was
myelosuppression
,
with
Grade
3
and
4
neutropenia
in
16
patients
,
anemia
in
12
patients
,
thrombocytopenia
in
11
patients
,
and
neutropenic
fever
in
3
patients
.

Four
patients
had
five
infusion
-
related
reactions
during
the
infusion
of
liposomal
doxorubicin
,
leading
to
treatment
discontinuation
in
three
patients
.

Grade
>
or
=
2
nonhematologic
toxicity
included
nausea

in
17
patients
,

emesis
in
14
patients
,
fatigue
in
9
patients
,
mucositis
and/or
stomatitis
in
8
patients
,
constipation
in
6
patients
,
weight
loss
in
5
patients
,
hand
-
foot
syndrome
in
2
patients
,
and
skin
reactions
in
3
patients
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
combination
of
carboplatin
and
liposomal
doxorubicin
has
modest
activity
in
patients
with
recurrent
cervical

.

Antimicrobial
-
induced
mania
(
antibiomania
):
a
review
of
spontaneous
reports
.

The
authors
reviewed
reported
cases
of
antibiotic
-
induced
manic
episodes
by
means
of
a
MEDLINE
and
PsychLit
search
for
reports
of
antibiotic
-
induced
mania
.

Unpublished
reports
were
requested
from
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
and
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
.

Twenty
-
one
reports
of
antimicrobial
-
induced
mania
were
found
in
the
literature
.

There
were
6
cases
implicating
clarithromycin
,
13
implicating
isoniazid
,
and
1
case
each
implicating
erythromycin
and
amoxicillin
.

The
WHO
reported
82
cases
.

Of
these
,
clarithromycin
was
implicated
in
23
(
27.6
%
)
cases
,
ciprofloxacin
in
12
(
14.4
%
)
cases
,
and
ofloxacin
in
10
(
12
%
)
cases
.

Cotrimoxazole
,
metronidazole
,
and
erythromycin
were
involved
in
15
reported

manic
episodes
.

Cases
reported
by
the
FDA
showed
clarithromycin
and
ciprofloxacin
to
be
the
most
frequently
associated
with
the
development
of
mania
.

Statistical
analysis
of
the
data
would
not
have
demonstrated
a
significant
statistical
correlative
risk
and
was
therefore
not
undertaken
.

Patients
have
an
increased
risk
of
developing
mania
while
being
treated
with
antimicrobials
.

Although
this
is
not
a
statistically
significant
risk
,
physicians
must
be
aware
of
the
effect
and
reversibility
.

Further
research
clearly
is
required
to
determine
the
incidence
of
antimicrobial
-
induced
mania
,
the
relative
risk
factors
of
developing
an
antimicrobial
-
induced
manic
episode
among
various
demographic
populations
,
and
the
incidence
of
patients
who
continue
to
have
persistent
affective
disorders
once
the
initial
episode
,
which
occurs
while
the
patient
is
taking
antibiotics
,
subsides
.

The
authors
elected
to
name
this
syndrome
"
antibiomania

Levodopa
-induced
ocular
dyskinesias
in
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Levodopa
-induced

ocular
dyskinesias
are
very
uncommon
.

Usually
they
occur
simultaneously
with
limb
peak
-
dose
choreatic
dyskinesias
.

We
report
on
a
patient
with
leftward
and
upward
deviations
of
gaze
during
the
peak
effect
of
levodopa
,
and
hypothesize
that
a
severe
dopaminergic
denervation
in
the
caudate
nucleus
is
needed
for
the
appearance
of
these
levodopa
-induce
ocular
dyskinesias
.

A
comparison
of
glyceryl
trinitrate
with
diclofenac
for
the
treatment
of
primary
dysmenorrhea
:
an
open
,
randomized
,
cross
-
over
trial
.

Primary
dysmenorrhea
is
a
syndrome
characterized
by
painful
uterine
contractility
caused
by
a
hypersecretion
of
endometrial
prostaglandins
;
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
are
the
first
choice
for
its
treatment
.

However
,
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
studies
have
demonstrated
that
myometrial
cells
are
also
targets
of
the
relaxant
effects
of
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
the
efficacy
of
glyceryl
trinitrate

(
GTN
)
,
an
NO
donor
,
in
the
resolution
of
primary
dysmenorrhea
in
comparison
with
diclofenac

(
DCF
)
.

A
total
of
24
patients
with
the
diagnosis
of
severe
primary
dysmenorrhea
were
studied
during
two
consecutive
menstrual
cycles
.

In
an
open
,
cross
-
over
,
controlled
design
,
patients
were
randomized
to
receive
either
DCF
per
os
or
GTN
patches
the
first
days
of
menses
,
when
menstrual
cramps
became
unendurable
.

In
the
subsequent
cycle
the
other
treatment
was
used
.

Patients
received
up
to
3
doses
/
day
of
50
mg
DCF
or
2.5
mg/24

h
transdermal
GTN
for
the
first
3
days
of
the
cycle
,
according
to
their
needs
.

The
participants
recorded
menstrual
symptoms
and
possible
side
-
effects
at
different
times
(
0
,
30
,
60
,
120
minutes
)
after
the
first
dose
of
medication
on
the
first
day
of
the
cycle
,
with
both
drugs
.

The
difference
in
pain

intensity
score
(
DPI
)
was
the
main
outcome
variable
.

Both
treatments
significantly
reduced
DPI
by
the
30th
minute
(
GTN
,
-12.8

+
/-
17.9
;
DCF
,
-18.9
+
/-
16.6
)
.

However
,
DCF
continued
to
be
effective
in
reducing
pelvic
pain
for
two
hours
,
whereas
GTN
scores
remained
more
or
less
stable
after
30
min
and
significantly
higher
than
those
for
DFC
(
after
one
hour
:
GTN
,
-12.8
+
/-
17.9
;
DFC
,
-18.9
+

/-
16.6
and
after
two
hours
:
GTN
,
-23.7
+
/-
20.5
;
DFC
,
-59.7
+
/-
17.9
,
p
=
0.0001
)
.

Low
back
pain
was
also
relieved
by
both
drugs
.

Headache
was
significantly
increased
by
GTN
but
not
by
DCF
.

Eight
patients
stopped
using
GTN
because
headache
--attributed
to
its
use
--
became
intolerable
.

These
findings
indicate
that
GTN
has
a
reduced
efficacy
and
tolerability
by
comparison
with
DCF
in
the
treatment
of
primary
dysmenorrhea
.

Temocapril
,
a
long
-
acting
non
-
SH
group
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
inhibitor
,
modulates
glomerular
injury
in
chronic
puromycin
aminonucleoside
nephrosis
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
whether
chronic
administration
of
temocapril
,
a
long
-
acting
non
-
SH
group
angiotensin

converting
enzyme
(
ACE
)
inhibitor
,
reduced

proteinuria
,
inhibited
glomerular
hypertrophy
and
prevented

glomerulosclerosis
in
chronic
puromycin
aminonucleoside

(
PAN
)
-
induced
nephrotic
rats
.

Nephrosis
was
induced
by
injection
of
PAN

(
15mg/100
g
body
weight
)
in
male
Sprague
-
Dawley
(
SD
)
rats
.

Four
groups
were
used
,
i
)
the
PAN
group
(
14
)
,
ii
)
PAN
/
temocapril
(
13
)
,
iii
)
temocapril

(
14
)
and
iv
)
untreated
controls
(
15
)
.

Temocapril

(
8
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
was
administered
to
the
rats
which
were
killed
at
weeks
4
,
14
or
20
.

At
each
time
point
,
systolic
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
,
urinary
protein
excretion
and
renal
histopathological
findings
were
evaluated
,
and
morphometric
image
analysis
was
done
.

Systolic
BP
in
the
PAN
group
was
significantly
high
at
4
,
14
and
20
weeks
,
but
was
normal
in
the
PAN
/
temocapril
group
.

Urinary
protein
excretion
in
the
PAN
group
increased
significantly
,
peaking
at
8
days
,
then
decreased
at
4
weeks
,
but
rose
again
significantly
at
14
and
20
weeks
.

Temocapril
did
not
attenuate

proteinuria
at
8
days
,
but
it
did
markedly
lower
it
from
weeks
4
to
20
.

The
glomerulosclerosis
index
(
GSI
)
was
6.21
%
at
4
weeks
and
respectively
25.35
%
and
30.49
%
at
14
and
20
weeks
in
the
PAN
group
.

There
was
a
significant
correlation
between
urinary
protein
excretion
and
GSI

(
r
=
0.808
,
p
0.0001
)
.

The
ratio
of
glomerular
tuft
area
to
the
area
of
Bowman
's
capsules
(
GT
/
BC
)
in
the
PAN
group
was
significantly
increased
,
but
it
was
significantly
lower
in
the
PAN
/
temocapril
group
.

It
appears
that
temocapril
was
effective
in
retarding
renal
progression
and
protected
renal
function
in
PAN
neprotic
rats
.

Pulmonary
hypertension
after
ibuprofen
prophylaxis
in
very
preterm
infants
.

We
report
three
cases
of
severe
hypoxaemia
after
ibuprofen
administration
during
a
randomised
controlled
trial
of
prophylactic
treatment
of
patent
ductus
arteriosus
with
ibuprofen
in
premature
infants
born
at
less
than
28
weeks
of
gestation
.

Echocardiography
showed
severely
decreased
pulmonary
blood
flow
.

Hypoxaemia
resolved
quickly
on
inhaled
nitric
oxide
therapy
.

We
suggest
that
investigators
involved
in
similar
trials
pay
close
attention
to
pulmonary
pressure
if
hypoxaemia
occurs
after
prophylactic
administration
of
ibuprofen
.

Hyponatremia
and
syndrome
of
inappropriate
anti
-
diuretic
hormone
reported
with
the
use
of
Vincristine
:
an
over
-
representation
of
Asians
?

PURPOSE
:

This
retrospective
study
used
a
pharmaceutical
company
's
global
safety
database
to
determine
the
reporting
rate
of
hyponatremia
and/or
syndrome
of
inappropriate
secretion
of
anti
-
diuretic
hormone

(
SIADH
)
among

vincristine

-treated
patients
and
to
explore
the
possibility
of
at
-
risk
population
subgroups
.

METHOD
:

We
searched
the
Eli
Lilly
and
Company
's
computerized
adverse
event
database
for
all
reported
cases
of
hyponatremia
and/or
SIADH
as
of
1
November
1999
that
had
been
reported
during
the
use
of
vincristine
.

RESULTS
:

A
total
of
76
cases
of
hyponatremia
and/or
SIADH
associated
with
vincristine
use
were
identified
.

The
overall
reporting
rate
was
estimated
to
be
1.3/100,000
treated
patients
.

The
average
age
of
patients
was
35.6
+
/-

28.3
years
,
and
62
%
were
males
.

Approximately
75
%
of
the
patients
were
receiving
treatment
for
leukemia
or
lymphoma
.

Among
the
39
reports
that
included
information
on
race
,
the
racial
distribution
was
:
1
Black
,
3
Caucasian
,
and
35
Asian
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
data
suggest
that
Asian
patients
may
be
at
increased
risk
of
hyponatremia
and/or
SIADH
associated
with
vincristine
use
.

Although
the
overall
reported
rate
of
SIADH
associated
with
vincristine
is
very
low
,
physicians
caring
for
Asian
oncology
patients
should
be
aware
of
this
potential
serious
but
reversible
adverse
event
.

Delayed
toxicity
of
cyclophosphamide
on
the
bladder
of
DBA/2
and
C57BL/6
female
mouse
.

The
present
study
describes
the
delayed
development
of
a
severe
bladder
pathology
in
a
susceptible
strain
of
mice
(
DBA/2
)
but
not
in
a
resistant
strain
(
C57BL/6
)
when
both
were
treated
with
a
single
300
mg
/
kg
dose
of
cyclophosphamide

(
CY
)
.

Inbred
DBA/2
and
C57BL/6
female
mice
were
injected
with
CY
,
and
the
effect
of
the
drug
on
the
bladder
was
assessed
during
100
days
by
light
microscopy
using
different
staining
procedures
,
and
after
30
days
by
conventional
electron
microscopy
.

Early
CY

toxicity
caused
a
typical
haemorrhagic
cystitis
in
both
strains
that
was
completely
repaired
in
about
7
-
10
days
.

After
30
days
of
CY
injection
ulcerous
and
non
-
ulcerous
forms
of
chronic
cystitis
appeared
in
86
%
of
DBA/2
mice
but
only
in
4
%
of
C57BL/6
mice
.

Delayed
cystitis
was
characterized
by
infiltration
and
transepithelial
passage
into
the
lumen
of
inflammatory
cells
and
by
frequent
exfoliation
of
the
urothelium
.

Mast
cells
appeared
in
the
connective
and
muscular
layers
of
the
bladder
at
a
much
higher
number
in
DBA/2
mice
than
in
C57BL/6
mice
or
untreated
controls
.

Electron
microscopy
disclosed
the
absence
of
the
typical
discoidal
vesicles
normally
present
in
the
cytoplasm
of
surface
cells
.

Instead
,
numerous
abnormal
vesicles
containing
one
or
several
dark
granules
were
observed
in
the
cytoplasm
of
cells
from
all
the
epithelial
layers
.

Delayed

cystitis
still
persisted
in
DBA/2
mice
100
days
after
treatment
.

These
results
indicate
that
delayed
toxicity
of
CY
in
female
DBA/2
mice
causes
a
bladder
pathology
that
is
not
observed
in
C57BL/6
mice
.

This
pathology
resembles
interstitial
cystitis
in
humans
and
could
perhaps
be
used
as
an
animal
model
for
studies
on
the
disease
.

High

mitomycin
C
in
the
treatment
of
advanced

cancer
.

A
phase
II
study
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
24-hour
continuous
infusion
of
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
and
folinic
acid

(
FA
)
as
part
of
several
new
multidrug
chemotherapy
regimens
in
advanced
gastric
cancer

(
AGC
)
has
shown
to
be
effective
,
with
low
toxicity
.

In
a
previous
phase
II
study
with
3-weekly
bolus
5-FU
,
FA
and
mitomycin
C

(
MMC
)

we
found
a
low
toxicity
rate
and
response
rates
comparable
to
those
of
regimens
such
as
ELF
,
FAM
or
FAMTX
,
and
a
promising
median
overall
survival
.

In
order
to
improve
this
MMC
-dependent
schedule
we
initiated
a
phase
II
study
with
high
-
dose
5-FU
/
FA
and
3-weekly
bolus
MMC
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

From
February

2000
we
recruited
33
patients

was
added
in
3-weekly
intervals
.

Treatment
given
on

CONCLUSIONS
:

High

is
an
effective
and
well
-
tolerated
outpatient
regimen
for
AGC

(

%
)
.

It
may
serve
as
an
alternative
to
cisplatin

-containing
regimens
;
however
,
it
has
to
be
considered
that
possibly
HUS
may
occur
.

Persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
is
associated
with
impaired
renal
function
in
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1-infected
children
treated
with
indinavir
.

BACKGROUND
:

Prolonged
administration
of
indinavir
is
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
a
variety
of
renal
complications
in
adults
.

These
well
-
documented
side
effects
have
restricted
the
use
of
this
potent
protease
inhibitor
in
children
.

DESIGN
:

A
prospective
study
to
monitor
indinavir
-related
nephrotoxicity
in
a
cohort
of
30
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1-infected
children
treated
with
indinavir
.

METHODS
:

Urinary
pH
,
albumin
,
creatinine
,
the
presence
of
erythrocytes
,
leukocytes
,
bacteria
and
crystals
,
and
culture
were
analyzed
every
3
months
for
96
weeks
.

Serum
creatinine
levels
were
routinely
determined
at
the
same
time
points
.

Steady
-
state
pharmacokinetics
of
indinavir
were
done
at
week
4
after
the
initiation
of
indinavir
.

RESULTS
:

The
cumulative
incidence
of
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
(
>
or
=
75
cells/
micro
L
in
at
least
2
consecutive
visits
)
after
96
weeks
was
53
%
.

Persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
was
frequently
associated
with
a
mild
increase
in
the
urine
albumin/
creatinine
ratio
and
by
microscopic
hematuria
.

The
cumulative
incidence
of
serum
creatinine
levels
>
50
%
above
normal
was
33
%
after
96
weeks
.

Children
with
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
more
frequently
had
serum
creatinine
levels
of
50
%
above
normal
than
those
children
without
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
.

In
children
younger
than
5.6
years
,
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
was
significantly
more
frequent
than
in
older
children
.

A
higher
cumulative
incidence
of
persistent
leukocyturia
was
found
in
children
with
an
area
under
the
curve
>

19
mg
/
L
x
h
or
a
peak
serum
level
of
indinavir
>

12
mg
/
L.

In
4
children
,
indinavir
was
discontinued
because
of
nephrotoxicity
.

Subsequently
,
the
serum
creatinine
levels
decreased
,
the
urine
albumin/
creatinine
ratios
returned
to
zero
,
and
the
leukocyturia
disappeared
within
3
months
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Children
treated
with
indinavir
have
a
high
cumulative
incidence
of
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
.

Children
with
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
more
frequently
had
an
increase
in
serum
creatinine
levels
of
>
50
%
above
normal
.

Younger
children
have
an
additional
risk
for
renal
complications
.

The
impairment
of
the
renal
function
in
these
children
occurred
in
the
absence
of
clinical
symptoms
of
nephrolithiasis
.

Indinavir
-associated

nephrotoxicity
must
be
monitored
closely
,
especially
in
children
with
risk
factors
such
as
persistent
sterile
leukocyturia
,

%
)
met
CK
-
MB
criteria
for
MI
and
38
(
16
%
)
had
cTnI
elevations
.

Angiography
was
performed
in
29
of
38
patients
who
were
cTnI
-
positive
,
with
significant
disease
present
in
25
(
86
%
)
.

Three
of
the
four
patients
without
significant
disease
who
had
cTnI
elevations
met
CK
-
MB
criteria
for
MI
,
and
the
other
had
a
peak
CK
-
MB
level
of
13
ng
/
mL.
Sensitivities
,
specificities
,
and
positive
and
negative
likelihood
ratios
for
predicting
cardiac
death
or
significant
disease
were
high
for
both
CK

MI
and
cTnI
and
were
not
significantly
different
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Most
patients
with
cTnI
elevations
meet
CK
-
MB
criteria
for
MI
,
as
well
as
have
a
high
incidence
of
underlying
significant
disease
.

Troponin
appears
to
have
an
equivalent
diagnostic
accuracy
compared
with
CK

for
diagnosing
necrosis
in
patients
with

chest
pain
and
suspected
MI

Acute
interstitial
nephritis
due
to
nicergoline

(
Sermion
)
.

We
report
a
case
of
acute
interstitial
nephritis

(
AIN
)
due
to
nicergoline

(
Sermion
)
.

A
50-year
-
old
patient
admitted
to
our
hospital
for
fever
and
acute
renal
failure
.

Before
admission
,
he
had
been
taking
nicergoline
and
bendazac
lysine
due
to
retinal
vein
occlusion
at
ophthalmologic
department
.

Thereafter
,
he
experienced
intermittent
fever
and
skin
rash
.

On
admission
,
clinical
symptoms
(
i.e.
arthralgia
and
fever
)
and
laboratory
findings
(
i.e.
eosinophilia
and
renal
failure
)
suggested
AIN
,
and
which
was
confirmed
by
pathologic
findings
on
renal
biopsy
.

A
lymphocyte
transformation
test
demonstrated
a
positive
result
against
nicergoline
.

Treatment
was
consisted
of
withdrawal
of
nicergoline
and
intravenous
methylprednisolone
,
and
his
renal
function
was
completely
recovered
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
report
of
nicergoline

-associated

AIN
.

Neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome
complicated
by
massive
intestinal
bleeding
in
a
patient
with
chronic
renal
failure
.

A
patient
with
chronic
renal
failure

(
CRF
)
developed
neuroleptic
malignant
syndrome

(
NMS
)
after
administration
of
risperidone
and
levomepromazine
.

In
addition
to
the
typical
symptoms
of
NMS
,
massive
intestinal
bleeding
was
observed
during
the
episode
.

This
report
suggests
that
NMS
in
a
patient
with
CRF
may
be
complicated
by
intestinal
bleeding
and
needs
special
caution
for
this
complication
.

Blood
brain
barrier
in
right-
and
left
-
pawed
female
rats
assessed
by
a
new
staining
method
.

The
asymmetrical
breakdown
of
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
(
BBB
)
was
studied
in
female
rats
.

Paw
preference
was
assessed
by
a
food
reaching
test
.

Adrenaline
-induced

hypertension
was
used
to
destroy
the
BBB
,
which
was
evaluated
using
triphenyltetrazolium

(
TTC
)
staining
of
the
brain
slices
just
after
giving
adrenaline
for
30
s.

In
normal
rats
,
the
whole
brain
sections
exhibited
complete
staining
with
TTC
.

After
adrenaline
infusion
for
30
s
,
there
were
large
unstained
areas
in
the
left
brain
in
right
-
pawed
animals
,
and
vice
versa
in
left
-
pawed
animals
.

Similar
results
were
obtained
in
seizure
-induced
breakdown
of
BBB
.

These
results
were
explained
by
an
asymmetric
cerebral
blood
flow
depending
upon
the
paw
preference
in
rats
.

It
was
suggested
that
this
new
method
and
the
results
are
consistent
with
contralateral
motor
control
that
may
be
important
in
determining
the
dominant
cerebral
hemisphere
in
animals
.

Carvedilol
protects
against
doxorubicin
-induced
mitochondrial
cardiomyopathy
.

Several
cytopathic
mechanisms
have
been
suggested
to
mediate
the
dose
-
limiting
cumulative
and
irreversible
cardiomyopathy
caused
by
doxorubicin
.

Recent
evidence
indicates
that
oxidative
stress
and
mitochondrial
dysfunction
are
key
factors
in
the
pathogenic
process
.

The
objective
of
this
investigation
was
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
carvedilol
,
a
nonselective
beta
-
adrenergic
receptor
antagonist
with
potent
antioxidant
properties
,
protects
against
the
cardiac
and
hepatic
mitochondrial
bioenergetic
dysfunction
associated
with
subchronic
doxorubicin
toxicity
.

Heart
and
liver
mitochondria
were
isolated
from
rats
treated
for
7
weeks
with
doxorubicin

(
2
mg
/
kg
sc
/
week
)
,
carvedilol

(
1
mg
/
kg
ip
/
week
)
,
or
the
combination
of
the
two
drugs
.

Heart
mitochondria
isolated
from
doxorubicin

-treated
rats
exhibited
depressed
rates
for
state
3
respiration
(
336
+
/-

26
versus
425
+
/-

53
natom
O
/
min
/
mg
protein
)
and
a
lower
respiratory
control
ratio
(
RCR
)
(
4.3
+
/-
0.6
versus
5.8
+
/-
0.4
)
compared
with
cardiac
mitochondria
isolated
from
saline
-
treated
rats
.

Mitochondrial
calcium
-loading
capacity
and
the
activity
of
NADH
-
dehydrogenase
were
also
suppressed
in
cardiac
mitochondria
from
doxorubicin
-treated
rats
.

Doxorubicin
treatment
also
caused
a
decrease
in
RCR
for
liver
mitochondria
(
3.9
+
/-
0.9
versus
5.6
+
/-
0.7
for
control
rats
)
and
inhibition
of
hepatic
cytochrome
oxidase
activity
.

Coadministration
of
carvedilol
decreased
the
extent
of
cellular
vacuolization
in
cardiac
myocytes
and
prevented
the
inhibitory
effect
of
doxorubicin
on
mitochondrial
respiration
in
both
heart
and
liver
.

Carvedilol
also
prevented
the
decrease
in
mitochondrial
Ca
(
2
+
)
loading
capacity
and
the
inhibition
of
the
respiratory
complexes
of
heart
mitochondria
caused
by
doxorubicin
.

Carvedilol
by
itself
did
not
affect
any
of
the
parameters
measured
for
heart
or
liver
mitochondria
.

It
is
concluded
that
this
protection
by
carvedilol
against
both
the
structural
and
functional
cardiac
tissue
damage
may
afford
significant
clinical
advantage
in
minimizing
the
dose
-
limiting
mitochondrial
dysfunction
and
cardiomyopathy
that
accompanies
long
-
term
doxorubicin
therapy
in
cancer
patients
.

Cocaine
-induced

hyperactivity
is
more
influenced
by
adenosine
receptor
agonists
than
amphetamine
-induced
hyperactivity
.

The
influence
of
adenosine
receptor
agonists
and
antagonists
on
cocaine
-and

amphetamine
-induced

hyperactivity
was
examined
in
mice
.

All
adenosine
receptor
agonists
significantly
decreased
the
locomotor
activity
in
mice
,
and
the
effects
were
dose
-
dependent
.

It
seems
that
adenosine
A1
and
A2
receptors
might
be
involved
in
this
reaction
.

Moreover
,
all
adenosine
receptor
agonists
:
2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N
-
ethylcarboxamidoadenosine
(
CGS
21680
)
,
A2A
receptor
agonist
,
N6-cyclopentyladenosine

(
CPA
)
,
A1
receptor
agonist
,
and
5'-N
-
ethylcarboxamidoadenosine
(
NECA
)
,
A2/A1
receptor
agonist
significantly
and
dose
-
dependently
decreased
cocaine

-induced
locomotor
activity
.

CPA
reduced
cocaine
action
at
the
doses
which
,
given
alone
,
did
not
influence
motility
,
while
CGS
21680
and
NECA
decreased
the
action
of
cocaine
at
the
doses
which
,
given
alone
,
decreased
locomotor
activity
in
animals
.

These
results
suggest
the
involvement
of
both
adenosine
receptors
in
the
action
of
cocaine
although
agonists
of
A1
receptors
seem
to
have
stronger
influence
on
it
.

The
selective
blockade
of
A2
adenosine
receptor
by
DMPX

(
3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine
)
significantly
enhanced

cocaine
-induced
locomotor
activity
of
animals
.

Caffeine
had
similar
action
but
the
effect
was
not
significant
.

CPT

(
8-cyclopentyltheophylline
)
--A1

receptor
antagonist
,
did
not
show
any
influence
in
this
test
.

Similarly
,
all
adenosine
receptor
agonists
decreased
amphetamine

-induced

hyperactivity
,
but
at
the
higher
doses
than
those
which
were
active
in
cocaine
-induced
hyperactivity
.

The
selective
blockade
of
A2
adenosine
receptors
(
DMPX
)
and
non
-
selective
blockade
of
adenosine
receptors
(
caffeine
)
significantly
increased
the
action
of
amphetamine
in
the
locomotor
activity
test
.

Our
results
have
shown
that
all
adenosine
receptor
agonists
(
A1
and
A2
)
reduce
cocaine
-
and
amphetamine
-induced
locomotor
activity
and
indicate
that
cocaine
-induced
hyperactivity
is
more
influenced
by
adenosine
receptor
agonists
(
particularly
A1
receptors
)
than
amphetamine
-induced
hyperactivity
.

Amiodarone
and
the
risk
of
bradyarrhythmia
requiring
permanent
pacemaker
in
elderly
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation
and
prior
myocardial
infarction
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
the
use
of
amiodarone
in
patients
with
atrial
fibrillation

(
AF
)
increases
the
risk
of
bradyarrhythmia
requiring
a
permanent
pacemaker
.

BACKGROUND
:

Reports
of
severe
bradyarrhythmia
during
amiodarone
therapy
are
infrequent
and
limited
to
studies
assessing
the
therapy
's
use
in
the
management
of
patients
with
ventricular
arrhythmias
.

METHODS
:

A
study
cohort
of
8,770
patients
age
>
or
=
65
years
with
a
new
diagnosis
of
AF
was
identified
from
a
provincewide
database
of
Quebec
residents
with
a
myocardial
infarction

(
MI
)
between
1991
and
1999
.

Using
a
nested
case
-
control
design
,
477
cases
of
bradyarrhythmia
requiring
a
permanent
pacemaker
were
matched
(
1:4
)
to
1,908
controls
.

Multivariable
logistic
regression
was
used
to
estimate
the
odds
ratio
(
OR
)
of
pacemaker
insertion
associated
with
amiodarone
use
,
controlling
for
baseline
risk
factors
and
exposure
to
sotalol
,
Class
I
antiarrhythmic
agents
,
beta
-
blockers
,
calcium
channel
blockers
,
and
digoxin
.

RESULTS
:

amiodarone
use
was
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
pacemaker
insertion
(
OR
:
2.14
,
95
%
confidence
interval
[
CI
]
:
1.30
to
3.54
)
.

This
effect
was
modified
by
gender
,
with
a
greater
risk
in
women
versus
men
(
OR
:
3.86
,
95
%
CI
:
1.70
to
8.75
vs.
OR
:
1.52
,
95
%
CI
:
0.80
to
2.89
)
.

Digoxin
was
the
only
other
medication
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
pacemaker
insertion
(

OR
:
1.78
,
95
%
CI
:
1.37
to
2.31
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

This
study
suggests
that
the
use
of
amiodarone
in
elderly
patients
with
AF
and
a
previous
MI
increases
the
risk
of
bradyarrhythmia
requiring
a
permanent
pacemaker
.

The
finding
of
an
augmented
risk
of
pacemaker
insertion
in
elderly
women
receiving
amiodarone
requires
further
investigation
.

Indomethacin
-induced
morphologic
changes
in
the
rat
urinary
bladder
epithelium
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
evaluate
the
morphologic
changes
in
rat
urothelium
induced
by
indomethacin
.

Nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
-
induced

cystitis
is
a
poorly
recognized
and
under
-
reported
condition
.

In
addition
to
tiaprofenic
acid
,
indomethacin
has
been
reported
to
be
associated
with
this
condition
.

METHODS
:

Three
groups
were
established
:
a
control
group
(
n
=
10
)
,
a
high
-
dose
group
(
n
=
10
)
,
treated
with
one
intraperitoneal
injection
of
indomethacin
20
mg
/
kg
,
and
a
therapeutic
dose
group
(
n
=
10
)
in
which
oral
indomethacin
was
administered
3.25
mg
/
kg
body
weight
daily
for
3
weeks
.

The
animals
were
then
killed
and
the
bladders
removed
for
light
and
electron
microscopic
studies
.

RESULTS
:

The
light
microscopic
findings
showed
some
focal
epithelial
degeneration
that
was
more
prominent
in
the
high
-
dose
group
.

When
compared
with
the
control
group
,
both
indomethacin
groups
revealed
statistically
increased
numbers
of
mast
cells
in
the
mucosa
(
P
0.0001
)
and
penetration
of
lanthanum
nitrate
through
intercellular
areas
of
the
epithelium
.

Furthermore
,
the
difference
in
mast
cell
counts
between
the
high
and
therapeutic
dose
groups
was
also
statistically
significant
(
P
0.0001
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Indomethacin
resulted
in
histopathologic
findings
typical
of
interstitial
cystitis
,
such
as
leaky
bladder
epithelium
and
mucosal
mastocytosis
.

The
true
incidence
of
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
-
induced
cystitis
in
humans
must
be
clarified
by
prospective
clinical
trials
.

An
open
-
label
phase
II
study
of
low
-
dose
thalidomide
in
androgen
-independent
prostate
cancer
.

The
antiangiogenic
effects
of
thalidomide
have
been
assessed
in
clinical
trials
in
patients
with
various
solid
and
haematological
malignancies
.

Thalidomide
blocks
the
activity
of
angiogenic
agents
including
bFGF
,
VEGF
and
IL-6
.

We
undertook
an
open
-
label
study
using
thalidomide
100
mg
once
daily
for
up
to
6
months
in
20
men
with

androgen
-independent

prostate
cancer
.

The
mean
time
of
study
was
109
days
(
median
107
,
range
4
-
184
days
)
.

Patients
underwent
regular
measurement
of
prostate
-
specific
antigen
(
PSA
)
,
urea
and
electrolytes
,
serum
bFGF
and
VEGF
.

Three
men
(
15
%
)
showed
a
decline
in
serum
PSA
of
at
least
50
%
,
sustained
throughout
treatment
.

Of
16
men
treated
for
at
least
2
months
,
six
(
37.5
%
)
showed
a
fall
in
absolute
PSA
by
a
median
of
48
%
.

Increasing
levels
of
serum
bFGF
and
VEGF
were
associated
with
progressive
disease
;
five
of
six
men
who
demonstrated
a
fall
in
PSA
also
showed
a
decline
in
bFGF
and
VEGF
levels
,
and
three
of
four
men
with
a
rising
PSA
showed
an
increase
in
both
growth
factors
.

Adverse
effects
included
constipation
,
morning
drowsiness
,
dizziness
and
rash
,
and
resulted
in
withdrawal
from
the
study
by
three
men
.

Evidence
of
peripheral
sensory
neuropathy
was
found
in
nine
of
13
men
before
treatment
.

In
the
seven
men
who
completed
six
months
on
thalidomide
,
subclinical
evidence
of
peripheral
neuropathy
was
found
in
four
before
treatment
,
but
in
all
seven
at
repeat
testing
.

The
findings
indicate
that
thalidomide
may
be
an
option
for
patients
who
have
failed
other
forms
of
therapy
,
provided
close
follow
-
up
is
maintained
for
development
of
peripheral
neuropathy
.

Central
nervous
system
toxicity
following
the
administration
of
levobupivacaine
for
lumbar
plexus
block
:

A
report
of
two
cases
.

BACKGROUND
AND
OBJECTIVES
:

Central
nervous
system
and
cardiac
toxicity
following
the
administration
of
local
anesthetics
is
a
recognized
complication
of
regional
anesthesia
.

Levobupivacaine
,
the
pure
S(-
)

enantiomer
of
bupivacaine
,
was
developed
to
improve
the
cardiac
safety
profile
of
bupivacaine
.

We
describe
2
cases
of
grand
mal
seizures
following
accidental
intravascular
injection
of
levobupivacaine
.

CASE
REPORT
:

Two
patients
presenting
for
elective
orthopedic
surgery
of
the
lower
limb
underwent
blockade
of
the
lumbar
plexus
via
the
posterior
approach
.

Immediately
after
the
administration
of
levobupivacaine
0.5
%
with
epinephrine
2.5
microgram
/
mL
,
the
patients
developed

grand
mal
seizures
,
despite
negative
aspiration
for
blood
and
no
clinical
signs
of
intravenous
epinephrine
administration
.

The
seizures
were
successfully
treated
with
sodium
thiopental
in
addition
to
succinylcholine
in
1
patient
.

Neither
patient
developed
signs
of
cardiovascular
toxicity
.

Both
patients
were
treated
preoperatively
with
beta
-
adrenergic
antagonist
medications
,
which
may
have
masked
the
cardiovascular
signs
of
the
unintentional
intravascular
administration
of
levobupivacaine
with
epinephrine
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Although
levobupivacaine
may
have
a
safer
cardiac
toxicity
profile
than
racemic
bupivacaine
,
if
adequate
amounts
of
levobupivacaine
reach
the
circulation
,
it
will
result
in
convulsions
.

Plasma
concentrations
sufficient
to
result
in
central
nervous
system
toxicity
did
not
produce
manifestations
of
cardiac
toxicity
in
these
2
patients
.

Anaesthetic
complications
associated
with
myotonia
congenita
:
case
study
and
comparison
with
other
myotonic
disorders
.

Myotonia
congenita

(
MC
)
is
caused
by
a
defect
in
the
skeletal
muscle
chloride
channel
function
,
which
may
cause
sustained
membrane
depolarisation
.

We
describe
a
previously
healthy
32-year
-
old
woman
who
developed
a
life
-
threatening
muscle
spasm
and
secondary
ventilation
difficulties
following
a
preoperative
injection
of
suxamethonium
.

The
muscle
spasms
disappeared
spontaneously
and
the
surgery
proceeded
without
further
problems
.

When
subsequently
questioned
,
she
reported
minor
symptoms
suggesting
a
myotonic
condition
.

Myotonia
was
found
on
clinical
examination
and
EMG
.

The
diagnosis
MC
was
confirmed
genetically
.

Neither
the
patient
nor
the
anaesthetist
were
aware
of
the
diagnosis
before
this
potentially
lethal
complication
occurred
.

We
give
a
brief
overview
of
ion
channel
disorders
including
malignant
hyperthermia
and
their
anaesthetic
considerations
.

Respiratory
pattern
in
a
rat
model
of
epilepsy
.

PURPOSE
:

Apnea
is
known
to
occur
during
seizures
,
but
systematic
studies
of
ictal
respiratory
changes
in
adults
are
few
.

Data
regarding
respiratory
pattern
defects
during
interictal
periods
also
are
scarce
.

Here
we
sought
to
generate
information
with
regard
to
the
interictal
period
in
animals
with

pilocarpine
-induced

epilepsy
.

METHODS
:
Twelve
rats
(
six
chronically
epileptic
animals
and
six
controls
)
were
anesthetized
,
given
tracheotomies
,
and
subjected
to
hyperventilation
or
hypoventilation
conditions
.

Breathing
movements
caused
changes
in
thoracic
volume
and
forced
air
to
flow
tidally
through
a
pneumotachograph
.

This
flow
was
measured
by
using
a
differential
pressure
transducer
,
passed
through
a
polygraph
,
and
from
this
to
a
computer
with
custom
software
that
derived
ventilation
(
VE
)
,
tidal
volume
(
VT
)
,
inspiratory
time
(
TI
)
,
expiratory
time
(
TE
)
,
breathing
frequency
(
f
)
,
and
mean
inspiratory
flow
(
VT
/
TI
)
on
a
breath
-
by
-
breath
basis
.

RESULTS
:

The
hyperventilation
maneuver
caused
a
decrease
in
spontaneous
ventilation
in
pilocarpine
-treated
and
control
rats
.

Although
VE
had
a
similar
decrease
in
both
groups
,
in
the
epileptic
group
,
the
decrease
in
VE
was
due
to
a
significant
(
p
0.05
)
increase
in
TE
peak
in
relation
to
that
of
the
control
animals
.

The
hypoventilation
maneuver
led
to
an
increase
in
the
arterial
Paco2
,
followed
by
an
increase
in
VE
.

In
the
epileptic
group
,
the
increase
in
VE
was
mediated
by
a
significant
(
p
0.05
)
decrease
in
TE
peak
compared
with
the
control
group
.

Systemic
application
of
KCN
,
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
peripheral
chemoreception
activation
on
ventilation
,
led
to
a
similar
increase
in
VE
for
both
groups
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
data
indicate
that
pilocarpine

-treated
animals
have
an
altered
ability
to
react
to
(
or
compensate
for
)
blood
gas
changes
with
changes
in
ventilation
and
suggest
that
it
is
centrally
determined
.

We
speculate
on
the
possible
relation
of
the
current
findings
on
treating
different
epilepsy
-associated
conditions
.

Increased
serum
soluble
Fas
in
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
due
to
paracetamol
overdose
.

BACKGROUND
/
AIMS
:

Experimental
studies
have
suggested
that
apoptosis
via
the
Fas
/
Fas
Ligand
signaling
system
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
acute
liver
failure
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
investigate
the
soluble
form
of
Fas
in
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
.

METHODOLOGY
:

Serum
levels
of
sFas
(
soluble
Fas
)
were
measured
by
ELISA
in
24
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
and
10
normal
control
subjects
.

Serum
levels
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
and
interferon
-
gamma
were
also
determined
by
ELISA
.

RESULTS
:

Serum
sFas
was
significantly
increased
in
patients
with
acute
liver
failure

(
median
,
26.8
U
/
mL
;
range
,
6.9
-
52.7
U
/
mL
)
compared
to
the
normal
controls
(

U
/
mL
;
range
,
6.5
-
12.0
U
/
mL
,
P
0.0001
)
.

Levels
were
significantly
greater
in
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
due
to
paracetamol
overdose

(
median
,
28.7
U
/
mL
;
range
,
12.8
-
52.7
U
/
mL
,
n
=
17
)
than
those
due
to
non
-
A
to
E
hepatitis

(
median
,
12.5
U
/
mL
;
range
,
6.9
-
46.0
U
/
mL
,
n
=
7
,
P
0.01
)
.

There
was
no
relationship
of
sFas
to
eventual
outcome
in
the
patients
.

A
significant
correlation
was
observed
between
serum
sFas
levels
and
aspartate
aminotransferase
(
r
=
0.613
,
P
0.01
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
increased
concentration
of
sFas
in
serum
of
patients
with
acute
liver
failure
may
reflect
activation
of
Fas
-
mediated
apoptosis
in
the
liver
and
this
together
with
increased
tumor
necrosis
factor

-
alpha
may
be
an
important
factor
in
liver
cell
loss
.

Bilateral
subthalamic
nucleus
stimulation
for
Parkinson
's
disease
.

High
frequency
stimulation
of
the
subthalamic
nucleus
(
STN
)
is
known
to
ameliorate
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
.

AIM
:
We
studied
the
effect
of
high
frequency
STN
stimulation
in
23
patients
.

METHOD
:

Twenty
-
three
patients
suffering
from
severe
Parkinson
's
disease

(
Stages
III
-
V
on
Hoehn
and
Yahr
scale
)
and
,
particularly
bradykinesia
,
rigidity
,
and
levodopa
-induced
dyskinesias
underwent
bilateral
implantation
of
electrodes
in
the
STN
.

Preoperative
and
postoperative
assessments
of
these
patients
at

recordings
.

RESULTS
:

After
one
year
of
electrical
stimulation
of
the
STN
,
the
patients
'
scores
for
activities
of
daily
living
and
motor

scores
(
Unified

)
off
medication
improved
by
62
%
and
61
%
respectively
(
p<0.0005
)
.

The
subscores
for
the
akinesia
,
rigidity
,
tremor
and
gait
also
improved
.

(
p<0.0005
)
.

The
average
levodopa
dose
decreased
from
813
mg
to
359
mg
.

The
cognitive
functions
remained
unchanged
.

Two
patients
developed
device
-
related
complications
and
two
patients
experienced
abnormal
weight
gain
.

CONCLUSION
:

Bilateral
subthalamic
nucleus
stimulation
is
an
effective
treatment
for
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
.

It
reduces
the
severity
of
"
off
"
phase
symptoms
,
improves
the
axial
symptoms
and
reduces
levodopa
requirements
.

The
reduction
in
the
levodopa
dose
is
useful
in
controlling
drug
-
induced
dyskinesias
.

Ocular
motility
changes
after
subtenon
carboplatin
chemotherapy
for
retinoblastoma
.

BACKGROUND
:

Focal
subtenon
carboplatin
injections
have
recently
been
used
as
a
presumably
toxicity
-free
adjunct
to
systemic
chemotherapy
for
intraocular
retinoblastoma
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
our
clinical
experience
with
abnormal
ocular
motility
in
patients
treated
with
subtenon
carboplatin
chemotherapy
.

METHODS
:

We
noted
abnormal
ocular
motility
in
10
consecutive
patients
with
retinoblastoma
who
had
received
subtenon
carboplatin
.

During
ocular
manipulation
under
general
anesthesia
,
we
assessed
their
eyes
by
forced
duction
testing
,
comparing
ocular
motility
after
tumor
control
with
ocular
motility
at
diagnosis
.

Eyes
subsequently
enucleated
because
of
treatment
failure
(
n
=
4
)
were
examined
histologically
.

RESULTS
:

Limitation
of
ocular
motility
was
detected
in
all
12
eyes
of
10
patients
treated
for
intraocular
retinoblastoma
with
1
to
6
injections
of
subtenon
carboplatin
as
part
of
multimodality
therapy
.

Histopathological
examination
revealed
many
lipophages
in
the
periorbital
fat
surrounding
the
optic
nerve
in
1
eye
,
indicative
of
phagocytosis
of
previously
existing
fat
cells
and
suggesting
prior
fat
necrosis
.

The
enucleations
were
technically
difficult
and
hazardous
for
globe
rupture
because
of
extensive
orbital
soft
tissue
adhesions
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Subtenon
carboplatin
chemotherapy
is
associated
with
significant
fibrosis
of
orbital
soft
tissues
,
leading
to
mechanical
restriction
of
eye
movements
and
making
subsequent
enucleation
difficult
.

Subtenon
carboplatin
is
not
free
of
toxicity
,
and
its
use
is
best
restricted
to
specific
indications
.

Ethambutol
and
optic
neuropathy
.

PURPOSE
:
To
demonstrate
the
association
between
ethambutol
and
optic
neuropathy
.

METHOD
:

Thirteen
patients
who
developed
optic
neuropathy
after
being
treated
with
ethambutol
for
tuberculosis
of
the
lung
or
lymph
node
at
Siriraj
Hospital
between
1997
and
2001
were
retrospectively
reviewed
.

The
clinical
characteristics
and
initial
and
final
visual
acuity
were
analyzed
to
determine
visual
outcome
.

RESULTS
:

All
patients
had
optic
neuropathy

between
1
to
6
months
(
mean
=
2.9
months
)
after
starting
ethambutol
therapy
at
a
dosage
ranging
from
13
to
20
mg
/
kg
/
day

(
mean
=
17
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
.

Seven
(
54
%
)
of
the
13
patients
experienced
visual
recovery
after
stopping
the
drug
.

Of
6
patients
with
irreversible
visual
impairment
,
4
patients
had
diabetes
mellitus
,
glaucoma
and
a
history
of
heavy
smoking
.

CONCLUSION
:

Early
recognition
of
optic
neuropathy
should
be
considered
in
patients
with
ethambutol
therapy
.

A
low
dose
and
prompt
discontinuation
of
the
drug
is
recommended
particularly
in
individuals
with
diabetes
mellitus
,
glaucoma
or
who
are
heavy
smokers
.

Treatment
of
compensatory
gustatory
hyperhidrosis
with
topical
glycopyrrolate
.

Gustatory
hyperhidrosis
is
facial
sweating
usually
associated
with
the
eating
of
hot
spicy
food
or
even
smelling
this
food
.

Current
options
of
treatment
include
oral
anticholinergic
drugs
,
the
topical
application
of
anticholinergics
or
aluminum
chloride
,
and
the
injection
of
botulinum
toxin
.

Thirteen
patients
have
been
treated
to
date
with
1.5
%
or
2
%
topical
glycopyrrolate
.

All
patients
had
gustatory
hyperhidrosis
,
which
interfered
with
their
social
activities
,
after
transthroacic
endoscopic
sympathectomy
,
and
which
was
associated
with
compensatory
focal
hyperhidrosis
.

After
applying
topical
glycopyrrolate
,
the
subjective
effect
was
excellent

(
no
sweating
after
eating
hot
spicy
food
)
in
10
patients
(
77
%
)
,
and
fair
(
clearly
reduced
sweating
)
in
3
patients
(
23
%
)
.

All
had
reported
incidents
of
being
very
embarrassed
whilst
eating
hot
spicy
foods
.

Adverse
effects
included
a
mildly
dry
mouth
and
a
sore
throat
in
2
patients
(
2
%
glycopyrrolate
)
,
a
light
headache
in
1
patient
(
1.5
%
glycopyrrolate
)
.

The
topical
application
of
a
glycopyrrolate
pad
appeared
to
be
safe
,
efficacious
,
well
tolerated
,
and
a
convenient
method
of
treatment
for
moderate
to
severe
symptoms
of
gustatory
hyperhidrosis
in
post
transthoracic
endoscopic
sympathectomy
or
sympathicotomy
patients
,
with
few
side
effects
.

Pharmacological
characteristics
and
side
effects
of
a
new
galenic
formulation
of
propofol
without
soyabean
oil
.

We
compared
the
pharmacokinetics
,
pharmacodynamics
and
safety
profile
of
a
new
galenic
formulation
of
propofol

(
AM149
1
%
)
,
which
does
not
contain
soyabean
oil
,
with
a
standard
formulation
of
propofol

(
Disoprivan
1
%
)
.

In
a
randomised
,
double
-
blind
,
cross
-
over
study
,
30
healthy
volunteers
received
a
single
intravenous
bolus
injection
of
2.5
mg.kg-1
propofol
.

Plasma
propofol
levels
were
measured
for
48
h
following
drug
administration
and
evaluated
according
to
a
three
-
compartment
model
.

The
pharmacodynamic
parameters
assessed
included
induction
and
emergence
times
,
respiratory
and
cardiovascular
effects
,
and
pain
on
injection
.

Patients
were
monitored
for
side
effects
over
48
h.
Owing
to
a
high
incidence
of
thrombophlebitis
,
the
study
was
terminated
prematurely
and
only
the
data
of
the
two
parallel
treatment
groups
(
15
patients
in
each
group
)
were
analysed
.

Plasma
concentrations
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
two
formulations
.

Anaesthesia
induction
and
emergence
times
,
respiratory
and
cardiovascular
variables
showed
no
significant
differences
between
the
two
treatment
groups
.

Pain
on
injection
(
80
vs.
20
%
,
p
0.01
)
and
thrombophlebitis

(
93.3
vs.
6.6
%
,
p
0.001
)
occurred
more
frequently
with
AM149
than
with
Disoprivan
.

Although
both
formulations
had
similar
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
profiles
the
new
formulation
is
not
suitable
for
clinical
use
due
to
the
high
incidence
of
thrombophlebitis
produced
.

Vinorelbine
-related
cardiac
events
:
a
meta
-
analysis
of
randomized
clinical
trials
.

Several
cases
of
cardiac
adverse
reactions
related
to
vinorelbine

(
VNR
)
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
.

In
order
to
quantify
the
incidence
of
these
cardiac
events
,
we
performed
a
meta
-
analysis
of
clinical
trials
comparing
VNR
with
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
in
the
treatment
of
various
malignancies
.

Randomized
clinical
trials
comparing
VNR
with
other
drugs
in
the
treatment
of
cancer
were
searched
in
Medline
,
Embase
,
Evidence
-
based
Medicine
Reviews
databases
and
the
Cochrane
library
from
1987
to
2002
.

Outcomes
of
interest
were
severe
cardiac
events
,
toxic
deaths
and
cardiac
event
-
related
deaths
reported
in
each
publication
.

We
found
19
trials
,
involving
2441
patients
treated
by
VNR
and
2050
control
patients
.

The
incidence
of
cardiac
events
with
VNR
was
1.19
%
[
95
%
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
(
0.75
;
1.67
)
]
.

There
was
no
difference
in
the
risk
of
cardiac
events
between
VNR
and
other
drugs

[
odds
ratio
:
0.92
,
95
%
CI
(
0.54
;
1.55
)
]
.

The
risk
of
VNR
cardiac
events
was
similar
to
vindesine

(
VDS
)
and
other
cardiotoxic
drugs
[
fluorouracil
,
anthracyclines
,
gemcitabine

(
GEM
)

em
leader
]
.

Even
if
it
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
because
of
a
few
number
of
cases
,
the
risk
was
lower
in
trials
excluding
patients
with
cardiac
history
,
and
seemed
to
be
higher
in
trials
including
patients
with
pre
-
existing
cardiac
diseases
.

Vinorelbine
-related
cardiac
events
concern
about
1
%
of
treated
patients
in
clinical
trials
.

However
,
the
risk
associated
with
VNR
seems
to
be
similar
to
that
of
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
in
the
same
indications
.

MRI
findings
of
hypoxic
cortical
laminar
necrosis
in
a
child
with
hemolytic
anemia
crisis
.

We
present
magnetic
resonance
imaging
findings
of
a
5-year
-
old
girl
who
had
a
rapidly
installing
hemolytic
anemia
crisis
induced
by
trimethoprim
-
sulfomethoxazole
,
resulting
in
cerebral
anoxia
leading
to
permanent
damage
.

Magnetic
Resonance
imaging
revealed
cortical
laminar
necrosis
in
arterial
border
zones
in
both
cerebral
hemispheres
,
ischemic
changes
in
subcortical
white
matter
of
left
cerebral
hemisphere
,
and
in
the
left
putamen
.

Although
cortical
laminar

necrosis
is
a
classic
entity
in
adulthood
related
to
conditions
of
energy
depletions
,
there
are
few
reports
available
in
children
.

A
wide
review
of
the
literature
is
also
presented
.

The
natural
history
of
Vigabatrin
associated

visual

defects
in
patients
electing
to
continue
their

.

PURPOSE
:

To
determine
the
natural
history
of
visual
field
defects
in
a
group
of
patients
known
to
have

Vigabatrin

-associated
changes
who
elected
to
continue
the
medication
because
of
good
seizure
control
.

METHODS
:

All
patients
taking
Vigabatrin
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
antiepileptic
drugs
for
at
least
5
years
(
range
5
-
12
years
)
were
entered
into
a
visual
surveillance
programme
.

Patients
were
followed
up
at
6-monthly
intervals
for
not
less
than
18
months
(

months
)
.

In
all
,
16
patients
with
unequivocal
defects
continued
the
medication
.

Following
already
published
methodology
(
Eye
2002
;
16;567
-
571
)
monocular
mean
radial
degrees
(
MRDs
)
to
the
I/4e
isopter
on
Goldmann
perimetry
was
calculated
for
the
right
eye
at
the
time
of
discovery
of
a
visual
field
defect
and
again
after
not
less
than
18
months
follow

up
.

RESULTS
:

Mean
right
eye
MRD
at
presentation
was
36.98
degrees
(
range
22.25
-
51.0
)
,
compared
to
38.40
degrees
(
range
22.5
-
49.75
)
after
follow

up
;
P=0.338
unpaired
t
-
test
.

Only
one
patient
demonstrated
a
deterioration
in
visual
field
during
the
study
period
and
discontinued
treatment
.

CONCLUSION
:

Established

visual
field
defects
presumed
to
be
due
to
Vigabatrin

therapy
did
not
usually
progress
in
spite
of
continuing
use
of
the
medication
.

These
data
give
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
the
pathogenesis
of
Vigabatrin
-associated
visual
field
defects
may
be
an
idiosyncratic
adverse
drug
reaction
rather
than
dose
-
dependent
toxicity
.

Induction
of
rosaceiform
dermatitis
during
treatment
of
facial
inflammatory
dermatoses
with
tacrolimus
ointment
.

BACKGROUND
:

Tacrolimus
ointment
is
increasingly
used
for
anti
-
inflammatory
treatment
of
sensitive
areas
such
as
the
face
,
and
recent
observations
indicate
that
the
treatment
is
effective
in
steroid
-aggravated

rosacea
and
perioral
dermatitis
.

We
report
on
rosaceiform
dermatitis
as
a
complication
of
treatment
with
tacrolimus
ointment
.

OBSERVATIONS
:

Six
adult
patients
with
inflammatory
facial
dermatoses
were
treated
with
tacrolimus
ointment
because
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
standard
treatments
.

Within
2
to
3
weeks
of
initially
effective
and
well
-
tolerated
treatment
,
3
patients
with
a
history
of
rosacea
and
1
with
a
history
of
acne
experienced
sudden
worsening
with
pustular
rosaceiform
lesions
.

Biopsy
revealed
an
abundance
of
Demodex
mites
in
2
of
these
patients
.

In
1
patient
with
eyelid
eczema
,
rosaceiform
periocular
dermatitis
gradually
appeared
after
3
weeks
of
treatment
.

In
1
patient
with
atopic
dermatitis
,
telangiectatic
and
papular
rosacea
insidiously
appeared
after
5
months
of
treatment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Our
observations
suggest
that
the
spectrum
of
rosaceiform
dermatitis
as
a
complication
of
treatment
with
tacrolimus
ointment
is
heterogeneous
.

A
variety
of
factors
,
such
as
vasoactive
properties
of
tacrolimus
,
proliferation
of
Demodex
due
to
local
immunosuppression
,
and
the
occlusive
properties
of
the
ointment
,
may
be
involved
in
the
observed
phenomena
.

Future
studies
are
needed
to
identify
individual
risk
factors
.

Structural
abnormalities
in
the
brains
of
human
subjects
who
use
methamphetamine
.

We
visualize
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
profile
of
structural
deficits
in
the
human
brain
associated
with
chronic
methamphetamine

(
MA
)
abuse
.

Studies
of
human
subjects
who
have
used
MA
chronically
have
revealed
deficits
in
dopaminergic
and
serotonergic
systems
and
cerebral
metabolic
abnormalities
.

Using
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(
MRI
)
and
new
computational
brain
-
mapping
techniques
,
we
determined
the
pattern
of
structural
brain
alterations
associated
with
chronic
MA
abuse
in
human
subjects
and
related
these
deficits
to
cognitive
impairment
.

We
used
high
-
resolution
MRI
and
surface
-
based
computational
image
analyses
to
map
regional
abnormalities
in
the
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
white
matter
,
and
ventricles
in
22
human
subjects
who
used
MA
and
21
age
-
matched
,
healthy
controls
.

Cortical
maps
revealed
severe
gray
-
matter
deficits
in
the
cingulate
,
limbic
,
and
paralimbic
cortices
of
MA
abusers
(
averaging
11.3
%
below
control
;
p
0.05
)
.

On
average
,
MA
abusers
had
7.8
%
smaller
hippocampal
volumes
than
control
subjects
(
p
0.01
;
left
,
p
=
0.01
;
right
,
p
0.05
)
and
significant
white
-
matter
hypertrophy
(
7.0
%
;
p
0.01
)
.

Hippocampal
deficits
were
mapped
and
correlated
with
memory
performance
on
a
word
-
recall
test
(
p
0.05
)
.

MRI
-
based
maps
suggest
that
chronic
methamphetamine
abuse
causes
a
selective
pattern
of
cerebral
deterioration
that
contributes
to
impaired
memory
performance
.

MA
may
selectively
damage
the
medial
temporal
lobe
and
,
consistent
with
metabolic
studies
,
the
cingulate
-
limbic
cortex
,
inducing
neuroadaptation
,
neuropil
reduction
,
or
cell
death
.

Prominent
white
-
matter
hypertrophy
may
result
from
altered
myelination
and
adaptive
glial
changes
,
including
gliosis
secondary
to
neuronal
damage
.

These
brain
substrates
may
help
account
for
the
symptoms
of
MA
abuse
,
providing
therapeutic
targets
for
drug
-
induced
brain
injury
.

Disruption
of
hepatic
lipid
homeostasis
in
mice
after
amiodarone
treatment
is
associated
with
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
-
alpha
target
gene
activation
.

Amiodarone
,
an
efficacious
and
widely
used
antiarrhythmic
agent
,
has
been
reported
to
cause
hepatotoxicity
in
some
patients
.

To
gain
insight
into
the
mechanism
of
this
unwanted
effect
,
mice
were
administered
various
doses
of
amiodarone
and
examined
for
changes
in
hepatic
histology
and
gene
regulation
.

Amiodarone
induced

hepatomegaly
,
hepatocyte
microvesicular
lipid
accumulation
,
and
a
significant
decrease
in
serum
triglycerides
and
glucose
.

Northern
blot
analysis
of
hepatic
RNA
revealed
a
dose
-
dependent
increase
in
the
expression
of
a
number
of
genes
critical
for
fatty
acid
oxidation
,
lipoprotein
assembly
,
and
lipid
transport
.

Many
of
these
genes
are
regulated
by
the
peroxisome
proliferator
-
activated
receptor
-
alpha
(
PPARalpha
)
,
a
ligand
-
activated
nuclear
hormone
receptor
transcription
factor
.

The
absence
of
induction
of
these
genes
as
well
as
hepatomegaly
in
PPARalpha
knockout

[
PPARalpha-/-
]
mice
indicated
that
the
effects
of
amiodarone
were
dependent
upon
the
presence
of
a
functional
PPARalpha
gene
.

Compared
to
wild
-
type
mice
,
treatment
of
PPARalpha-/-
mice
with
amiodarone
resulted
in
an
increased
rate
and
extent
of
total
body
weight
loss
.

The
inability
of
amiodarone
to
directly
activate
either
human
or
mouse
PPARalpha
transiently
expressed
in
human
HepG2

hepatoma
cells
indicates
that
the
effects
of
amiodarone
on
the
function
of
this
receptor
were
indirect
.

Based
upon
these
results
,
we
conclude
that
amiodarone
disrupts
hepatic
lipid
homeostasis
and
that
the
increased
expression
of
PPARalpha
target
genes
is
secondary
to
this
toxic
effect
.

These
results
provide
important
new
mechanistic
information
regarding
the
hepatotoxic
effects
of
amiodarone
and
indicate
that
PPARalpha
protects
against
amiodarone
-induced
hepatotoxicity
.

A
total
of
4,499
patients
with

.

Patients
also
received

In

A
case
of
postoperative
anxiety
due
to
low
dose
droperidol
used
with
patient
-
controlled
analgesia
.

A
multiparous
woman
in
good
psychological
health
underwent
urgent
caesarean
section
in
labour
.

Postoperatively
,
she
was
given
a
patient
-
controlled
analgesia
device
delivering
boluses
of
diamorphine
0.5
mg
and
droperidol
0.025
mg
.

Whilst
using
the
device
she
gradually
became
anxious
,
the
feeling
worsening
after
each
bolus
.

The
diagnosis
of
droperidol
-induced

psychological
disturbance
was
not
made
straight
away
although
on
subsequent
close
questioning
the
patient
gave
a
very
clear
history
.

After
she
had
received
a
total
of
only
0.9
mg
droperidol
,
a
syringe
containing
diamorphine
only
was
substituted
and
her
unease
resolved
completely
.

We
feel
that
,
although
the
dramatic
extrapyramidal
side
effects
of
dopaminergic
antiemetics
are
well
known
,
more
subtle
manifestations
may
easily
be
overlooked
.

Accurate
patient
history
contributes
to
differentiating
diabetes
insipidus
:
a
case
study
.

This
case
study
highlights
the
important
contribution
of
nursing
in
obtaining
an
accurate
health
history
.

The
case
discussed
herein
initially
appeared
to
be
neurogenic
diabetes
insipidus

(
DI
)
secondary
to
a
traumatic
brain
injury
.

The
nursing
staff
,
by
reviewing
the
patient
's
health
history
with
his
family
,
discovered
a
history
of
polydipsia
and
long
-
standing
lithium
use
.

Lithium
is
implicated
in
drug
-
induced
nephrogenic
DI
,
and
because
the
patient
had
not
received
lithium
since
being
admitted
to
the
hospital
,
his
treatment
changed
to
focus
on
nephrogenic
DI
.

By
combining
information
from
the
patient
history
,
the
physical
examination
,
and
radiologic
and
laboratory
studies
,
the
critical
care
team
demonstrated
that
the
patient
had
been
self
-
treating
his
lithium
-induced
nephrogenic
DI
and
developed
neurogenic
DI
secondary
to
brain
trauma
.

Thus
successful
treatment
required
that
nephrogenic
and
neurogenic
DI
be
treated
concomitantly
.

Factors
contributing
to
ribavirin

-induced

anemia
.

BACKGROUND
AND
AIM
:

Interferon
and
ribavirin
combination
therapy
for
chronic
hepatitis
C
produces
hemolytic
anemia
.

This
study
was
conducted
to
identify
the
factors
contributing
to
ribavirin

-induced

anemia
.

METHODS
:

Eighty
-
eight
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
who
received
interferon
-
alpha-2b
at
a
dose
of
6
MU
administered
intramuscularly
for
24
weeks
in
combination
with
ribavirin
administered
orally
at
a
dose
of
600
mg
or
800
mg
participated
in
the
study
.

A
hemoglobin
concentration
of
10
g
/
dL
was
defined
as
ribavirin
-induced
anemia
.

RESULTS
:

Ribavirin
-induced

anemia
occurred
in
18
(
20.5
%
)

patients
during
treatment
.

A
2
g
/
dL
decrease
in
hemoglobin
concentrations
in
patients
with
anemia
was
observed
at
week
2
after
the
start
of
treatment
.

The
hemoglobin
concentration
in
patients
with
>
or
=
2
g
/
dL
decrease
at
week
2
was
observed
to
be
significantly
lower
even
after
week
2
than
in
patients
with
2
g
/
dL
decrease
(
P
0.01
)
.

A
significant
relationship
was
observed
between
the
rate
of
reduction
of
hemoglobin
concentrations
at
week
2
and
the
severity
of
anemia

(
P
0.01
)
.

Such
factors
as
sex
(
female
)
,
age
(
>
or
=
60
years
old
)
,
and
the
ribavirin
dose
by
body
weight
(
12
mg
/
kg
or
more
)
were
significant
by
univariate
analysis
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Careful
administration
is
necessary
in
patients

>

or
=
60
years
old
,
in
female
patients
,
and
in
patients
receiving
a
ribavirin
dose
of
12
mg
/
kg
or
more
.

Patients
who
experience
a
fall
in
hemoglobin
concentrations
of
2
g
/
dL
or
more
at
week
2
after
the
start
of
treatment
should
be
monitored
with
particular
care
.

Oxidative
damage
precedes
nitrative
damage
in
adriamycin
-induced
cardiac
mitochondrial
injury
.

The
purpose
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
if
elevated
reactive
oxygen

(
ROS)/
nitrogen
species
(
RNS
)
reported
to
be
present
in
adriamycin

(
ADR
)
-induced

cardiotoxicity
actually
resulted
in
cardiomyocyte
oxidative
/
nitrative
damage
,
and
to
quantitatively
determine
the
time
course
and
subcellular
localization
of
these
postulated
damage
products
using
an
in
vivo
approach
.

B6C3
mice
were
treated
with
a
single
dose
of
20
mg
/
kg
ADR
.

Ultrastructural
damage
and
levels
of
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal

(
4HNE
)

-protein
adducts
and
3-nitrotyrosine
(
3NT
)
were
analyzed
.

Quantitative
ultrastructural
damage
using
computerized
image
techniques
showed
cardiomyocyte
injury
as
early
as
3
hours
,
with
mitochondria
being
the
most
extensively
and
progressively
injured
subcellular
organelle
.

Analysis
of
4HNE
protein
adducts
by
immunogold
electron
microscopy
showed
appearance
of
4HNE
protein
adducts
in
mitochondria
as
early
as
3
hours
,
with
a
peak
at
6
hours
and
subsequent
decline
at
24
hours
.

3NT
levels
were
significantly
increased
in
all
subcellular
compartments
at
6
hours
and
subsequently
declined
at
24
hours
.

Our
data
showed
ADR
induced

4HNE

-protein

adducts
in
mitochondria
at
the
same
time
point
as
when
mitochondrial
injury
initially
appeared
.

These
results
document
for
the
first
time
in
vivo
that
mitochondrial
oxidative
damage
precedes
nitrative
damage
.

The
progressive
nature
of
mitochondrial
injury
suggests
that
mitochondria
,
not
other
subcellular
organelles
,
are
the
major
site
of
intracellular
injury
.

Sotalol
-induced
coronary
spasm
in
a
patient
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy
associated
with
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia
.

A
54-year
-
old
man
with
severe
left
ventricular
dysfunction
due
to
dilated
cardiomyopathy
was
referred
to
our
hospital
for
symptomatic
incessant
sustained
ventricular
tachycardia

(
VT
)
.

After
the
administration
of
nifekalant
hydrochloride
,
sustained
VT
was
terminated
.

An
alternate
class
III
agent
,
sotalol
,
was
also
effective
for
the
prevention
of
VT
.

However
,
one
month
after
switching
over
nifekalant
to
sotalol
,
a
short
duration
of
ST
elevation
was
documented
in
ECG
monitoring
at
almost
the
same
time
for
three
consecutive
days
.

ST
elevation
with
chest

Effects
of
the
antidepressant
trazodone
,
a
5-HT
2A/2C
receptor
antagonist
,
on
dopamine

-dependent
behaviors
in
rats
.

RATIONALE
:

5-Hydroxytryptamine
,
via
stimulation
of
5-HT

2C
receptors
,
exerts
a
tonic
inhibitory
influence
on
dopaminergic
neurotransmission
,
whereas
activation
of
5-HT
2A
receptors
enhances
stimulated
DAergic
neurotransmission
.

The
antidepressant
trazodone
is
a
5-HT
2A/2C
receptor
antagonist
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
evaluate
the
effect
of
trazodone
treatment
on
behaviors
dependent
on
the
functional
status
of
the
nigrostriatal
DAergic
system
.

METHODS
:

The
effect
of
pretreatment
with
trazodone
on
dexamphetamine
-
and
apomorphine
-induced
oral
stereotypies
,
on
catalepsy
induced
by
haloperidol
and
apomorphine
(
0.05
mg
/

,
i.p
.
)
,
on
ergometrine

-induced
wet
dog
shake
(
WDS
)
behavior
and

fluoxetine
-induced
penile
erections
was
studied
in
rats
.

We
also
investigated
whether
trazodone
induces
catalepsy
in
rats
.

RESULTS
:

Trazodone
at
2.5
-
20
mg
/
kg
i.p
.

did
not
induce
catalepsy
,
and
did
not
antagonize
apomorphine
(
1.5
and
3
mg
/
kg
)
stereotypy
and
apomorphine
(
0.05
mg
/
kg)-induced
catalepsy
.

However
,
pretreatment
with
5
,
10
and
20
mg
/
kg
i.p
.

trazodone
enhanced
dexamphetamine
stereotypy
,
and
antagonized
haloperidol
catalepsy
,
ergometrine
-induced
WDS
behavior
and

fluoxetine
-induced
penile
erections
.

Trazodone
at
30
,
40
and
50
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
induced

catalepsy
and
antagonized
apomorphine
and
dexamphetamine
stereotypies
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Our
results
indicate
that
trazodone
at
2.5
-
20
mg
/
kg
does
not
block
pre-
and
postsynaptic
striatal
D2
DA
receptors
,
while
at
30
,
40
and
50
mg
/
kg

it
blocks
postsynaptic
striatal
D2
DA
receptors
.

Furthermore
,
at
5
,
10
and
20
mg
/
kg
,
trazodone
blocks
5-HT
2A
and
5-HT
2C
receptors
.

We
suggest
that
trazodone
(
5
,
10
and
20
mg
/
kg
)
,
by
blocking
the
5-HT

2C
receptors
,
releases
the
nigrostriatal
DAergic
neurons
from
tonic
inhibition
caused
by
5-HT
,
and
thereby
potentiates
dexamphetamine
stereotypy
and
antagonizes
haloperidol
catalepsy
.

Swallowing
abnormalities
and
dyskinesia
in
Parkinson
's
disease
.

Gastrointestinal
abnormalities
in
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
have
been
known
for
almost
two
centuries
,
but
many
aspects
concerning
their
pathophysiology
have
not
been
completely
clarified
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
the
oropharyngeal
dynamics
in
PD
patients
with
and
without

levodopa
-induced

dyskinesia
.

Fifteen
dyskinetic
,
12
nondyskinetic
patients
,
and
a
control
group
were
included
.

Patients
were
asked
about
dysphagia
and
evaluated
with
the
Unified
Parkinson
's
Disease
Rating
Scale
Parts
II
and
III
and
the
Hoehn
and
Yahr
scale
.

Deglutition
was
assessed
using
modified
barium
swallow
with
videofluoroscopy
.

Nondyskinetic
patients
,
but
not
the
dyskinetic
ones
,
showed
less
oropharyngeal
swallowing
efficiency
(
OPSE
)
for
liquid
food
than
controls
(
Dunnett
,
P
=
0.02
)
.

Dyskinetic
patients
tended
to
have
a
greater
OPSE
than
nondyskinetic
(
Dunnett
,
P
=
0.06
)
.

Patients
who
were
using
a
higher
dose
of
levodopa
had
a
greater
OPSE
and
a
trend
toward
a
smaller
oral
transit
time
(
Pearson
's
correlation
,
P
=
0.01
and
0.08
,
respectively
)
.

Neither
the
report
of
dysphagia
nor
any
of
the
PD
severity
parameters
correlated
to
the
videofluoroscopic
variables
.

In
the
current
study
,
dyskinetic
patients
performed
better
in
swallowing
function
,
which
could
be
explained
on
the
basis
of
a
greater
levodopa
dose
.

Our
results
suggest
a
role
for
levodopa
in
the
oral
phase
of
deglutition
and
confirm
that
dysphagia
is
not
a
good
predictor
of
deglutition
alterations
in
PD
.

Inhibition
of
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
activation
attenuates
tubulointerstitial
nephritis
induced
by
gentamicin
.

BACKGROUND
:

Animals
treated
with
gentamicin
can
show
residual
areas
of
interstitial
fibrosis
in
the
renal
cortex
.

This
study
investigated
the
expression
of
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
(
NF
-
kappaB
)
,
mitogen
-
activated
protein
(
MAP
)
kinases
and
macrophages
in
the
renal
cortex
and
structural
and
functional
renal
changes
of
rats
treated
with
gentamicin
or
gentamicin
+
pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate

(
PDTC
)
,
an
NF
-
kappaB
inhibitor
.

METHODS
:
38
female
Wistar
rats
were
injected
with
gentamicin
,
40
mg
/
kg
,
twice
a
day
for
9
days
,
38
with
gentamicin
+
PDTC
,
and
28
with
0.15
M
NaCl
solution
.

The
animals
were
killed
5
and
30
days
after
these
injections
and
the
kidneys
were
removed
for
histological
and
immunohistochemical
studies
.

The
results
of
the
immunohistochemical
studies
were
scored
according
to
the
extent
of
staining
.

The
fractional
interstitial
area
was
determined
by
morphometry
.

RESULTS
:

Gentamicin

-treated
rats
presented
a
transitory
increase
in
plasma
creatinine
levels
.

Increased
ED-1
,
MAP
kinases
and
NF
-
kappaB
staining
were
also
observed
in
the
renal
cortex
from
all
gentamicin
-treated
rats
compared
to
control
(
p
0.05
)
.

The
animals
killed
on
day
30
also
presented
fibrosis
in
the
renal
cortex
despite
the
recovery
of
renal
function
.

Treatment
with
PDTC
reduced
the
functional
and
structural
changes
induced
by
gentamicin
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
data
show
that
inhibition
of
NF
-
kappaB
activation
attenuates
tubulointerstitial
nephritis
induced
by
gentamicin
.

BACKGROUND
:

While
the
incidence
of
new

onset
diabetes
mellitus
may
be
increasing
in
patients
with
schizophrenia
treated
with
certain
atypical
antipsychotic
agents
,
it
remains
unclear
whether
atypical
agents
are
directly
affecting
glucose
metabolism
or
simply
increasing
known

factors
for
diabetes
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
study
the

Focal
cerebral
ischemia
in
rats
:
effect
of

phenylephrine
-induced

hypertension
during
reperfusion
.

After
180
min
of
temporary
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion
in
spontaneously
hypertensive
rats
,
the
effect
of
phenylephrine
-induced
hypertension
on

ischemic
brain
injury
and
blood
-
brain
barrier
permeability
was
determined
.

Blood
pressure
was
manipulated
by
one
of
the
following
schedules
during
120
min
of
reperfusion
:
Control
,
normotensive
reperfusion
;
90/
hypertension
(
90/
HTN
)
,
blood
pressure
was
increased
by
35
mm
Hg
during
the
initial
90
min
of
reperfusion
only
;

15/
hypertension
(
15/
HTN
)
,
normotensive
reperfusion
for
30
min
followed
by
15
min
of
hypertension
and
75
min
of
normotension
.

Part
A
,
for
eight
rats
in
each
group
brain
injury
was
evaluated
by
staining
tissue
using
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride
and
edema
was
evaluated
by
microgravimetry
.

Part
B
,
for
eight
different
rats
in
each
group
blood
-
brain
barrier
permeability
was
evaluated
by
measuring
the
amount
and
extent
of
extravasation
of
Evans
Blue
dye
.

Brain
injury
(
percentage
of
the
ischemic
hemisphere
)
was
less
in
the
15/
HTN
group
(
16
+
/-
6
,
mean
+
/-

SD
)
versus
the
90/
HTN
group
(
30
+

/-
6
)
,
which
was
in
turn
less
than
the
control
group
(
42
+
/-
5
)
.

Specific
gravity
was
greater
in
the
15/
HTN
group
(
1.043
+
/-
0.002
)
versus
the
90/
HTN
(
1.036
+
/-
0.003
)
and
control
(
1.037
+
/-
0.003
)
groups
.

Evans
Blue
(
mug
g-1
of
brain
tissue
)
was
greater
in
the
90/
HTN
group
(
24.4
+
/-
6.0
)
versus
the
control
group
(
12.3
+
/-

4.1
)
,
which
was
in
turn
greater
than
the
15/
HTN
group
(
7.3
+
/-
3.2
)
.

This
study
supports
a
hypothesis
that
during
reperfusion
,
a
short
interval
of
hypertension
decreases
brain
injury
and
edema
;
and
that
sustained
hypertension
increases
the
risk
of
vasogenic
edema
.

in
more
than
500
patient
-
years
of
follow
-
up
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
determine
the
incidence
of
major
hemorrhage
and
stroke
in
people
aged
76
and
older
with
atrial
fibrillation
on
adjusted
-
dose
warfarin
who
had
been
recently
been
admitted
to
hospital
.

DESIGN
:

A
retrospective
observational
cohort
study
.

SETTING
:

A
major
healthcare
network
involving
four
tertiary
hospitals
.

PARTICIPANTS
:

Two
hundred
thirty
-
five
patients
aged
76
and
older
admitted
to
a
major
healthcare
network
between
July
1
,
2001
,
and
June
30
,
2002
,
with

atrial
fibrillation
on
warfarin
were
enrolled
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
Information
regarding
major
bleeding
episodes
,
strokes
,
and
warfarin
use
was
obtained
from
patients
,
relatives
,
primary
physicians
,
and
medical
records
.

RESULTS
:

Two
hundred
twenty
-
eight
patients
(
42
%
men
)
with
a
mean
age
of
81.1
(
range
76
-
94
)
were
included
in
the
analysis
.

Total
follow
-
up
on
warfarin
was
530
years
(
mean
28
months
)
.

There
were
53
major
hemorrhages
,
for
an
annual
rate
of
10.0
%
,
including
24
(
45.3
%
)
life
-
threatening
and
five
(
9.4
%
)
fatal
bleeds
.

The
annual
stroke
rate
after
initiation
of
warfarin
was
2.6
%
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
rate
of
major
hemorrhage
was
high
in
this
old
,
frail
group
,
but
excluding
fatalities
,
resulted
in
no
long
-
term
sequelae
,
and
the
stroke
rate
on
warfarin
was
low
,
demonstrating
how
effective
warfarin

treatment
is
.

Safety
of
celecoxib
in
patients
with
adverse
skin
reactions
to
acetaminophen

(
paracetamol
)
and
nimesulide
associated
or
not
with
common
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
.

BACKGROUND
:

Acetaminophen

(
paracetamol
--
P
)
and
Nimesulide

(
N
)
are
widely
used
analgesic
-
antipyretic
/
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
.

The
rate
of
adverse
hypersensitivity
reactions
to
these
agents
is
generally
low
.

On
the
contrary
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
commonly
involved
in
such
reactions
.

Celecoxib

(
CE
)
is
a
novel
drug
,
with
high
selectivity
and
affinity
for
COX-2
enzyme
.

OBJECTIVE
:

We
evaluated
the
tolerability
of
CE
in
a
group
of
patients
with
documented
history
of
adverse
cutaneous
reactions
to
P
and
N
associated
or
not
to
classic
NSAIDs
.

METHODS
:

We
studied
9
patients
with
hypersensitivity
to
P
and
N
with
or
without
associated
reactions
to
classic
NSAIDs
.

The
diagnosis
of
P
and
N

-induced

skin
reactions
was
based
in
vivo
challenge
.

The
placebo
was
blindly
administered
at
the
beginning
of
each
challenge
.

After
three
days
,
a
cumulative
dosage
of
200
mg
of
CE
in
refracted
doses
were
given
.

After
2
-
3
days
,
a
single
dose
of
200
mg
was
administered
.

All
patients
were
observed
for
6
hours
after
each
challenge
,
and
controlled
again
after
24
hours
to
exclude
delayed
reactions
.

The
challenge
was
considered
positive
if
one
or
more
of
the
following
appeared
:
erythema
,
rush
or
urticaria
-
angioedema
.

RESULTS
:

No
reaction
was
observed
with
placebo
and
eight
patients
(
88.8
%
)
tolerated

CE
.

Only
one
patient
developed
a
moderate
angioedema
of
the
lips
.

CONCLUSION
:

Only
one
hypersensitivity
reaction
to
CE
was
documented
among
9
P
and
N
-highly
NSAIDs
intolerant
patients
.

Thus
,
we
conclude
that
CE
is
a
reasonably
safe
alternative
to
be
used
in
subjects
who
do
not
tolerate

Case
-
control
study
of
regular
analgesic
and
nonsteroidal
anti

inflammatory
use
and
end
-
stage
renal
disease
.

BACKGROUND
:

Studies
on
the
association
between
the
long
-
term
use
of
aspirin
and
other
analgesic
and
nonsteroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
and
end
-
stage
renal
disease
(
ESRD
)
have
given
conflicting
results
.

In
order
to
examine
this
association
,
a
case
-
control
study
with
incident
cases
of
ESRD
was
carried
out
.

METHODS
:

The
cases
were
all
patients
entering
the
local
dialysis
program
because
of
ESRD
in
the
study
area
between
June
1
,
1995
and
November
30
,
1997
.

They
were
classified
according
to
the
underlying
disease
,
which
had
presumably
led
them
to
ESRD
.

Controls
were
patients
admitted
to
the
same
hospitals
from
where
the
cases
arose
,
also
matched
by
age
and
sex
.

Odds
ratios
were
calculated
using
a
conditional
logistic
model
,
including
potential
confounding
factors
,
both
for
the
whole
study
population
and
for
the
various
underlying
diseases
.

RESULTS
:

Five
hundred
and
eighty
-
three
cases
and
1190
controls
were
included
in
the
analysis
.

Long
-
term
use
of
any
analgesic
was
associated
with
an
overall
odds
ratio
of
1.22
(
95
%
CI
,
0.89
-
1.66
)
.

For
specific
groups
of
drugs
,
the
risks
were
1.56
(
1.05
-
2.30
)
for
aspirin
,
1.03
(
0.60
-
1.76
)
for
pyrazolones
,
0.80
(
0.39
-
1.63
)
for
paracetamol
,
and
0.94
(
0.57
-
1.56
)
for
nonaspirin
NSAIDs
.

The
risk
of
ESRD
associated
with
aspirin
was
related
to
the
cumulated
dose
and
duration
of
use
,
and
it
was
particularly
high
among
the
subset
of
patients
with
vascular
nephropathy
as
underlying
disease
[
2.35
(
1.17
-
4.72
)
]
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
data
indicate
that
long
-
term
use
of
nonaspirin
analgesic
drugs
and
NSAIDs
is
not
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
ESRD
.

However
,
the
chronic
use
of
aspirin
may
increase
the
risk
of
ESRD
.

Two

Two
cases
of
deliberate
self-

with
5
g
and
3.6

,
respectively
,
are
reported
.

In
both
cases
,
QT
prolongation
and

were
noted
.

The

Growth
-
associated
protein
43
expression
in
hippocampal
molecular
layer
of
chronic
epileptic
rats
treated
with
cycloheximide
.

PURPOSE
:

GAP43
has
been
thought
to
be
linked
with
mossy
fiber
sprouting
(
MFS
)
in
various
experimental
models
of
epilepsy
.

To
investigate
how
GAP43
expression
(
GAP43-ir
)
correlates
with
MFS
,
we
assessed
the
intensity
(
densitometry
)
and
extension
(
width
)
of
GAP43-ir
in
the
inner
molecular
layer
of
the
dentate
gyrus
(
IML
)
of
rats
subject
to
status
epilepticus
induced
by
pilocarpine

(
Pilo
)
,
previously
injected
or
not
with
cycloheximide

(
CHX
)
,
which
has
been
shown
to
inhibit
MFS
.

METHODS
:

CHX
was
injected
before
the
Pilo
injection
in
adult
Wistar
rats
.

The
Pilo
group
was
injected
with
the
same
drugs
,
except
for
CHX
.

Animals
were
killed
between
30
and
60
days
later
,
and
brain
sections
were
processed
for
GAP43
immunohistochemistry
.

RESULTS
:

Densitometry
showed
no
significant
difference
regarding
GAP43-ir
in
the
IML
between
Pilo
,
CHX
+
Pilo
,
and
control
groups
.

However
,
the
results
of
the
width
of
the
GAP43-ir
band
in
the
IML
showed
that
CHX
+
Pilo
and
control
animals
had
a
significantly
larger
band
(
p
=
0.03
)
as
compared
with
that
in
the
Pilo
group
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Our
current
finding
that
animals
in
the
CHX
+
Pilo
group
have
a
GAP43-ir
band
in
the
IML
,
similar
to
that
of
controls
,
reinforces
prior
data
on
the
blockade
of
MFS
in
these
animals
.

The
change
in
GAP43-ir
present
in
Pilo

-treated
animals
was
a
thinning
of
the
band
to
a
very
narrow
layer
just
above
the
granule
cell
layer
that
is
likely
to
be
associated
with
the
loss
of
hilar
cell
projections
that
express
GAP-43
.

Nicotine
antagonizes

caffeine
-
but
not

pentylenetetrazole
-induced
anxiogenic
effect
in
mice
.

RATIONALE
:

Nicotine
and
caffeine
are
widely
consumed
licit
psychoactive
drugs
worldwide
.

Epidemiological
studies
showed
that
they
were
generally
used
concurrently
.

Although
some
studies
in
experimental
animals
indicate
clear
pharmacological
interactions
between
them
,
no
studies
have
shown
a
specific
interaction
on
anxiety
responses
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
present
study
investigates
the
effects
of
nicotine
on
anxiety
induced
by
caffeine
and
another
anxiogenic
drug
,
pentylenetetrazole
,
in
mice
.

The
elevated
plus
-
maze
(
EPM
)
test
was
used
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
drugs
on
anxiety
.

METHODS
:

Adult
male
Swiss
Webster
mice
(
25
-
32
g
)
were
given
nicotine
(
0.05
-
0.25
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)
or
saline
10
min
before
caffeine

(
70
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)
or
pentylenetetrazole
(
15
and
30
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

injections
.

After
15
min
,
mice
were
evaluated
for
their
open-
and
closed
-
arm
time
and
entries
on
the
EPM
for
a
10-min
session
.

Locomotor
activity
was
recorded
for
individual
groups
by
using
the
same
treatment
protocol
with
the
EPM
test
.

RESULTS
:

Nicotine
(
0.05
-
0.25
mg
/
kg
)
itself
did
not
produce
any
significant
effect
in
the
EPM
test
,
whereas
caffeine

(
70
mg
/
kg
)
and
pentylenetetrazole
(
30
mg
/
kg
)
produced
an
anxiogenic
effect
,
apparent
with
decreases
in
open
-
arm
time
and
entry
.

Nicotine
(
0.25
mg
/
kg
)
pretreatment
blocked
the
caffeine
-
but
not
pentylenetetrazole
-induced
anxiety
.

Administration
of
each
drug
and
their
combinations
did
not
produce
any
effect
on
locomotor
activity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Our
results
suggest
that
the
antagonistic
effect
of
nicotine
on
caffeine
-induced

anxiety
is
specific
to
caffeine
,
instead
of
a
non
-
specific
anxiolytic
effect
.

Thus
,
it
may
extend
the
current
findings
on
the
interaction
between
nicotine
and
caffeine
.

Long

for
perimenopausal
and
postmenopausal
women
.

BACKGROUND
:

Hormone
therapy
(
HT
)
is
widely
used
for
controlling
menopausal
symptoms
.

It
has
also
been
used
for
the
management
and
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease
,
osteoporosis
and
dementia
in
older
women
but
the
evidence
supporting
its
use
for
these
indications
is
largely
observational
.

OBJECTIVES
:

To
assess
the
effect
of
long
-
term
HT
on
mortality
,
heart

.

SEARCH
STRATEGY
:

We
searched
the
following
databases
up
to
November
2004
:
the
Cochrane
Menstrual
Disorders
and
Subfertility
Group
Trials
Register
,
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(
CENTRAL
)
,
MEDLINE
,
EMBASE
,
Biological
Abstracts
.

Relevant
non
-
indexed
journals
and
conference
abstracts
were
also
searched
.

SELECTION
CRITERIA
:

Randomised
double
-
blind
trials
of
HT
(
oestrogens
with
or
without
progestogens
)
versus
placebo
,
taken
for
at
least
one
year
by
perimenopausal
or
postmenopausal
women
.

DATA
COLLECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
:

Fifteen
RCTs
were
included
.

Trials
were
assessed
for
quality
and
two
review
authors
extracted
data
independently
.

They
calculated
risk
ratios
for
dichotomous
outcomes
and
weighted
mean
differences
for
continuous
outcomes
.

Clinical
heterogeneity
precluded
meta
-
analysis
for
most
outcomes
.

MAIN
RESULTS
:

All
the
statistically
significant
results
were
derived
from
the
two
biggest
trials
.

In
relatively
healthy
women
,
combined
continuous
HT
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
or
coronary
event
(
after
one
year
's
use
)
,
stroke

(
after
3
years
)
,
breast
cancer

(
after
5
years
)
and
gallbladder
disease
.

Long
-
term

oestrogen

-only

HT
also
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
stroke
and
gallbladder
disease
.

Overall
,
the
only
statistically
significant
benefits
of
HT
were
a
decreased
incidence
of
fractures
and
colon
cancer
with
long
-
term
use
.

Among
relatively
healthy
women
over
65
years
taking
continuous
combined
HT
,
there
was
a
statistically
significant
increase
in
the
incidence
of
dementia
.

Among
women
with
cardiovascular
disease
,
long
-
term
use
of
combined
continuous
HT
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
venous
thromboembolism
.

No
trials
focussed
specifically
on
younger
women
.

However
,
one
trial
analysed
subgroups
of
2839
relatively
healthy
50
to
59
year
-
old
women
taking
combined
continuous
HT
and
1637
taking
oestrogen

-only

HT
,
versus
similar
-
sized
placebo
groups
.

The
only
significantly
increased
risk
reported
was
for
venous
thromboembolism
in
women
taking
combined
continuous
HT
;
their
absolute
risk
remained
very
low
.

AUTHORS
'
CONCLUSIONS
:
HT
is
not
indicated
for
the
routine
management
of
chronic
disease
.

We
need
more
evidence
on
the
safety
of
HT
for
menopausal
symptom
control
,
though
short
-
term
use
appears
to
be
relatively
safe
for
healthy
younger
women
.

Drug
-
induced
liver
injury
:
an
analysis
of
461
incidences
submitted
to
the
Spanish
registry
over
a
10-year
period
.

BACKGROUND
&
AIMS
:

Progress
in
the
understanding
of
susceptibility
factors
to
drug
-
induced
liver
injury

(
DILI
)
and
outcome
predictability
are
hampered
by
the
lack
of
systematic
programs
to
detect
bona
fide
cases
.

METHODS
:

A
cooperative
network
was
created
in
1994
in
Spain
to
identify
all
suspicions
of
DILI
following
a
prospective
structured
report
form
.

The
liver
damage
was
characterized
according
to
hepatocellular
,
cholestatic
,
and
mixed
laboratory
criteria
and
to
histologic
criteria
when
available
.

Further
evaluation
of
causality
assessment
was
centrally
performed
.

RESULTS
:

Since
April
1994
to
August
2004
,
461
out
of
570
submitted
cases
,
involving
505
drugs
,
were
deemed
to
be
related
to
DILI
.

The
antiinfective
group
of
drugs
was
the
more
frequently
incriminated
,
amoxicillin
-
clavulanate
accounting
for
the
12.8
%
of
the
whole
series
.

The
hepatocellular
pattern
of
damage
was
the
most
common
(
58
%
)
,
was
inversely
correlated
with
age
(
P
.0001
)
,
and
had
the
worst
outcome
(
Cox
regression
,
P
.034
)
.

Indeed
,
the
incidence
of
liver
transplantation
and
death
in
this
group
was
11.7
%
if
patients
had
jaundice
at
presentation
,
whereas
the
corresponding
figure
was
3.8
%
in
nonjaundiced
patients
(
P
.04
)
.

Factors
associated
with
the
development
of
fulminant
hepatic
failure
were
female
sex
(
OR
=
25
;
95
%
CI
:
4.1
-
151
;
P
.0001
)
,
hepatocellular
damage
(
OR
=
7.9
;
95
%
CI
:
1.6
-
37
;
P
.009
)
,
and
higher
baseline
plasma

bilirubin
value
(
OR
=
1.15
;
95
%
CI
:
1.09
-
1.22
;

P

)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Patients
with
drug
-
induced
hepatocellular
jaundice
have
11.7
%
chance
of
progressing
to
death
or
transplantation
.

Amoxicillin
-
clavulanate
stands
out
as
the
most
common
drug
related

evidences
suggesting
the
role
of
oxidative
stress
in
pathogenesis
of
vancomycin

-induced

nephrotoxicity
:
protection
by
erdosteine
.

The
aims
of
this
study
were
to
examine
vancomycin

(
VCM
)

-induced
oxidative
stress
that
promotes
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
to
investigate
the
role
of
erdosteine
,
an
expectorant
agent
,
which
has
also
antioxidant
properties
,
on
kidney
tissue
against
the
possible
VCM
-induced

renal
impairment
in
rats
.

Rats
were
divided
into
three
groups
:
sham
,
VCM
and
VCM
plus
erdosteine
.

VCM
was
administrated
intraperitoneally
(
i.p
.
)

with
200mgkg(-1
)
twice
daily
for
7
days
.

Erdosteine
was
administered
orally
.

VCM
administration
to
control
rats
significantly
increased
renal
malondialdehyde

(
MDA
)
and
urinary
N
-
acetyl
-
beta
-
d
-
glucosaminidase
(
NAG
,
a
marker
of
renal
tubular
injury
)
excretion
but
decreased

superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
and
catalase
(
CAT
)
activities
.

Erdosteine
administration
with
VCM
injections
caused
significantly
decreased
renal
MDA
and
urinary
NAG
excretion
,
and
increased
SOD
activity
,
but
not
CAT
activity
in
renal
tissue
when
compared
with
VCM
alone
.

Erdosteine
showed
histopathological
protection
against
VCM

-induced

nephrotoxicity
.

There
were
a
significant
dilatation
of
tubular
lumens
,
extensive
epithelial
cell
vacuolization
,
atrophy
,
desquamation
,
and
necrosis
in
VCM
-treated
rats
more
than
those
of
the
control
and
the
erdosteine
groups
.

Erdosteine
caused
a
marked
reduction
in
the
extent
of
tubular
damage
.

It
is
concluded
that
oxidative
tubular
damage
plays
an
important
role
in
the
VCM
-induced

nephrotoxicity
and
the
modulation
of
oxidative
stress
with
erdosteine
reduces
the
VCM
-induced

kidney
damage
both
at
the
biochemical
and
histological
levels
.

Does
domperidone
potentiate
mirtazapine

-associated

restless
legs
syndrome
?

There
is
now
evidence
to
suggest
a
central
role
for
the
dopaminergic
system
in
restless
legs
syndrome

(
RLS
)
.

For
example
,
the
symptoms
of
RLS
can
be
dramatically
improved
by
levodopa
and
dopamine
agonists
,
whereas
central
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonists
can
induce
or
aggravate
RLS
symptoms
.

To
our
knowledge
,
there
is
no
previous
report
regarding
whether
domperidone
,
a
peripheral
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonist
,
can
also
induce
or
aggravate
symptoms
of
RLS
.

Mirtazapine
,
the
first
noradrenergic
and
specific
serotonergic
antidepressant
(
NaSSA
)
,
has
been
associated
with
RLS
in
several
recent
publications
.

The
authors
report
here
a
depressed
patient
comorbid
with
postprandial
dyspepsia
who
developed
RLS
after
mirtazapine
had
been
added
to
his
domperidone
therapy
.

Our
patient
started
to
have
symptoms
of
RLS
only
after
he
had
been
treated
with
mirtazapine
,
and
his
RLS
symptoms
resolved
completely
upon
discontinuation
of
his
mirtazapine
.

Such
a
temporal
relationship
between
the
use
of
mirtazapine
and
the
symptoms
of
RLS
in
our
patient
did
not
support
a
potentiating
effect
of
domperione
on
mirtazapine

-associated

RLS
.

However
,
physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
possibility
that
mirtazapine
can
be
associated
with
RLS
in
some
individuals
,
especially
those
receiving
concomitant
dopamine
D2
receptor
antagonists
.

Antiandrogenic
therapy
can
cause
coronary

.

AIM

To

in

5-Fluorouracil

cardiotoxicity
induced
by
alpha
-
fluoro
-
beta
-
alanine
.

Cardiotoxicity
is
a
rare
complication
occurring
during
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
treatment
for
malignancies
.

We
herein
report
the
case
of
a
70-year
-
old
man
with
5-FU

-induced

cardiotoxicity
,
in
whom
a
high
serum
level
of
alpha
-
fluoro
-
beta
-
alanine

(
FBAL
)
was
observed
.

The
patient
,
who
had
unresectable
colon
cancer
metastases
to
the
liver
and
lung
,
was
referred
to
us
for
chemotherapy
from
an
affiliated
hospital
;
he
had
no
cardiac
history
.

After
admission
,
the
patient
received
a
continuous
intravenous
infusion
of
5-FU

(
1000
mg
/
day
)
,
during
which
precordial
pain
with
right
bundle
branch
block
occurred
concomitantly
with
a
high
serum
FBAL
concentration
of
1955
ng
/
ml
.

Both
the
precordial
pain
and
the
electrocardiographic
changes
disappeared
spontaneously
after
the
discontinuation
of
5-FU
.

As
the
precordial
pain
in
this
patient
was
considered
to
have
been
due
to
5-FU
-induced

cardiotoxicity
,
the
administration
of
5-FU
was
abandoned
.

Instead
,
oral
administration
of
S-1
(
a
derivative
of
5-FU
)
,
at
200
mg
/
day
twice
a
week
,
was
instituted
,
because
S-1
has
a
strong
inhibitory
effect
on
dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase
,
which
catalyzes
the
degradative
of
5-FU
into
FBAL
.

The
serum
FBAL
concentration
subsequently
decreased
to
352
ng
/
ml
,
the
same
as
the
value
measured
on
the
first
day
of
S-1
administration
.

Thereafter
,
no
cardiac
symptoms
were
observed
.

The
patient
achieved
a
partial
response
6
months
after
the
initiation
of
the
S-1
treatment
.

The
experience
of
this
case
,
together
with
a
review
of
the
literature
,
suggests
that
FBAL
is
related
to
5-FU
-induced
cardiotoxicity
.
S-1
may
be
administered
safely
to
patients
with
5-FU

-induced

cardiotoxicity
.

The
influence
of
the
time
interval
between
monoHER
and
doxorubicin
administration
on
the
protection
against
doxorubicin
-induced
cardiotoxicity
in
mice
.

PURPOSE
:

Despite
its
well
-
known
cardiotoxicity
,
the
anthracyclin
doxorubicin

(
DOX
)
continues
to
be
an
effective
and
widely
used
chemotherapeutic
agent
.

DOX
-induced

cardiac
damage
presumably
results
from
the
formation
of
free
radicals
by
DOX
.

Reactive
oxygen
species
particularly
affect
the
cardiac
myocytes
because
these
cells
seem
to
have
a
relatively
poor
antioxidant
defense
system
.

The
semisynthetic
flavonoid
monohydroxyethylrutoside

(
monoHER
)
showed
cardioprotection
against
DOX

-induced

cardiotoxicity
through
its
radical
scavenging
and
iron
chelating
properties
.

Because
of
the
relatively
short
final
half
-
life
of
monoHER
(
about
30
min
)
,
it
is
expected
that
the
time
interval
between
monoHER
and
DOX
might
be
of
influence
on
the
cardioprotective
effect
of
monoHER
.

Therefore
,
the
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
this
possible
effect
.

METHODS
:
Six
groups
of
6
BALB
/
c
mice
were
treated
with
saline
,
DOX
alone
or
DOX
(
4
mg
/
kg
i.v
.
)
preceded
by
monoHER

(
500
mg
/
kg
i.p
.
)

with
an
interval
of
10
,
30
,
60
or
120
min
.

After
a
6-week
treatment
period
and
additional
observation
for
2
weeks
,
the
mice
were
sacrificed
.

Their
cardiac
tissues
were
processed
for
light
microscopy
,
after
which
cardiomyocyte
damage
was
evaluated
according
to
Billingham
(
in
Cancer
Treat
Rep
62(6):865
-
872
,
1978
)
.

Microscopic
evaluation
revealed
that
treatment
with
DOX
alone
induced
significant
cardiac
damage
in
comparison
to
the
saline
control
group
(
P<0.001
)
.

RESULTS
:

The
number
of
damaged
cardiomyocytes
was
9.6-fold
(
95
%
CI
4.4
-
21.0
)
higher
in
mice
treated
with
DOX
alone
than
that
in
animals
of
the
control
group
.

The
ratio
of
aberrant
cardiomyocytes
in
mice
treated
with
DOX
preceded
by
monoHER
and
those
in
mice
treated
with
saline
ranged
from
1.6
to
2.8
(
mean
2.2
,
95
%
CI
1.2
-
4.1
,
P=0.019
)
.

The
mean
protective
effect
by
adding
monoHER
before
DOX
led
to
a
significant
4.4-fold
reduction
(
P<0.001
,
95
%
CI
2.3
-
8.2
)
of
abnormal
cardiomyocytes
.

This
protective
effect
did
not
depend
on
the
time
interval
between
monoHER
and
DOX
administration
(
P=0.345
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
results
indicate
that
in
an
outpatient
clinical
setting
monoHER
may
be
administered
shortly
before
DOX
.

Clinical
evaluation
of
adverse
effects
during
bepridil
administration
for
atrial
fibrillation
and
flutter
.

BACKGROUND
:

Bepridil
hydrochloride

(
Bpd
)
has
attracted
attention
as
an
effective
drug
for
atrial
fibrillation

(
AF
)
and
atrial
flutter

(
AFL
)
.

However
,
serious
adverse
effects
,
including
torsade
de
pointes

(
Tdp
)
,
have
been
reported
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Adverse
effects
of
Bpd
requiring
discontinuation
of
treatment
were
evaluated
.

Bpd
was
administered
to
459
patients
(
361
males
,
63+/-12
years
old
)
comprising
378
AF
and
81
AFL
cases
.

Mean
left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
and
atrial
dimension
(
LAD
)
were
66+/-11
%
and
40+/-6
mm
,
respectively
.

Adverse
effects
were
observed
in
19
patients
(
4
%
)
during
an
average
follow
-
up
of
20
months
.

There
was
marked

QT
prolongation
greater
than
0.55
s
in
13
patients
,
bradycardia
less
than
40
beats
/
min
in
6
patients
,
dizziness
and
general
fatigue
in
1
patient
each
.

In
4
of
13
patients
with
QT
prolongation
,
Tdp
occurred
.

The
major
triggering
factors
of
Tdp
were
hypokalemia
and
sudden
decrease
in
heart
rate
.

There
were
no
differences
in
the
clinical
backgrounds
of
the
patients
with
and
without
Tdp
other
than
LAD
and
age
,
which
were
larger
and
older
in
the
patients
with
Tdp
.

CONCLUSION
:

Careful
observation
of
serum

potassium
concentration
and
the
ECG
should
always
be
done
during
Bpd
administration
,
particularly
in
elderly
patients
.

Enhanced

isoproterenol
-induced

cardiac
hypertrophy
in
transgenic
rats
with
low
brain
angiotensinogen
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
a
permanent
deficiency
in
the
brain
renin-
angiotensin
system
(
RAS
)
may
increase
the
sensitivity
of
the
baroreflex
control
of
heart
rate
.

In
this
study
we
aimed
at
studying
the
involvement
of
the
brain
RAS
in
the
cardiac
reactivity
to
the
beta
-
adrenoceptor
(
beta
-
AR
)
agonist
isoproterenol

(
Iso
)
.

Transgenic
rats
with
low
brain
angiotensinogen
(
TGR
)
were
used
.

In
isolated
hearts
,
Iso
induced
a
significantly
greater
increase
in
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
pressure
and
maximal
contraction
(
+
dP
/
dt(max
)
)
in
the
TGR
than
in
the
Sprague
-
Dawley
(
SD
)
rats
.

LV
hypertrophy
induced
by
Iso
treatment
was
significantly
higher
in
TGR
than
in
SD
rats
(
in
g

wt
,
0.28
+
/-

0.004
vs.
0.24
+
/-

0.004
,
respectively
)
.

The
greater
LV
hypertrophy
in
TGR
rats
was
associated
with
more
pronounced
downregulation
of
beta
-
AR
and
upregulation
of
LV
beta
-
AR
kinase-1

mRNA
levels
compared
with
those
in
SD
rats
.

The
decrease
in
the
heart
rate
(
HR
)
induced
by
the
beta
-
AR
antagonist
metoprolol
in
conscious
rats
was
significantly
attenuated
in
TGR
compared
with
SD
rats
(
-9.9
+
/-

1.7
%
vs.
-18.1

+
/-
1.5
%
)
,
whereas
the
effect
of
parasympathetic
blockade
by
atropine
on
HR
was
similar
in
both
strains
.

These
results
indicate
that
TGR
are
more
sensitive
to
beta
-
AR
agonist
-
induced
cardiac
inotropic
response
and
hypertrophy
,
possibly
due
to
chronically
low
sympathetic
outflow
directed
to
the
heart
.

patients
and
risk
factors
.

BACKGROUND
:
Drug
-
induced

long
QT
syndrome
is
a
serious
adverse
drug
reaction
.

Methadone
prolongs
the
QT
interval
in
vitro
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
.

In
the
inpatient
setting
,
the
frequency
of
QT
interval
prolongation
with
methadone
treatment
,
its
dose
dependence
,
and
the
importance
of
cofactors
such
as
drug
-
drug
interactions
remain
unknown
.

METHODS
:
We
performed
a
systematic
,
retrospective
study
comparing
active
or
former
intravenous
drug
users
receiving
methadone
and
those
not
receiving
methadone
among
all
patients
hospitalized
over
a
5-year
period
in
a
tertiary
care
hospital
.

A
total
of
167
patients
receiving
methadone
fulfilled
the
inclusion
criteria
and
were
compared
with
a
control
group
of
80
injection
drug
users
not
receiving
methadone
.

In
addition
to
methadone
dose
,
15
demographic
,
biological
,
and
pharmacological
variables
were
considered
as
potential
risk
factors
for
QT
prolongation
.

RESULTS
:

Among
167
methadone
maintenance
patients
,
the
prevalence
of
QTc
prolongation
to
0.50
second((1/2
)
)
or
longer
was
16.2
%
compared
with
0
%
in
80
control
subjects
.

Six
patients
(
3.6
%
)
in
the
methadone
group
presented
torsades
de
pointes
.

QTc
length
was
weakly
but
significantly
associated
with
methadone

daily
dose
(
Spearman
rank
correlation
coefficient
,
0.20
;

P<.01
)
.

Multivariate
regression
analysis
allowed
attribution
of
31.8
%
of
QTc
variability
to
methadone
dose
,
cytochrome
P-450
3A4
drug
-
drug
interactions
,
hypokalemia
,
and
altered
liver
function
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

QT
interval
prolongation
in
methadone
maintenance
patients
hospitalized
in
a
tertiary
care
center
is
a
frequent
finding
.

Methadone
dose
,
presence
of
cytochrome
P-450
3A4
inhibitors
,
potassium
level
,
and
liver
function
contribute
to
QT
prolongation
.

Long

can
occur
with
low
doses
of
methadone
.

Mechanisms
of
hypertension
induced
by
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
deficiency
:
focus
on
venous
function
.

Loss
of
endothelial
cell
-
derived
nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
in
hypertension
is
a
hallmark
of
arterial
dysfunction
.

Experimental
hypertension
created
by
the
removal
of
NO
,
however
,
involves
mechanisms
in
addition
to
decreased
arterial
vasodilator
activity
.

These
include
augmented
endothelin-1
(
ET-1
)
release
,
increased
sympathetic
nervous
system
activity
,
and
elevated
tissue
oxidative
stress
.

We
hypothesized
that
increased
venous
smooth
muscle
(
venomotor
)
tone
plays
a
role
in
Nomega
-
nitro
-
L
-
arginine

(
LNNA
)

hypertension
through
these
mechanisms
.

Rats
were
treated
with
the
NO
synthase
inhibitor
LNNA

(
0.5
g
/
L
in
drinking
water
)
for
2
weeks
.

Mean
arterial
pressure
of
conscious
rats
was
119
+
/-

2
mm
Hg
in
control
and
194
+
/-
5
mm
Hg
in
LNNA
rats
(
P<0.05
)
.

Carotid
arteries
and
vena
cava
were
removed
for
measurement
of
isometric
contraction
.

Maximal
contraction
to
norepinephrine
was
modestly
reduced
in
arteries
from
LNNA
compared
with
control
rats
whereas
the
maximum
contraction
to
ET-1
was
significantly
reduced
(
54
%
control
)
.

Maximum
contraction
of
vena
cava
to
norepinephrine

(
37
%
control
)
also
was
reduced
but
no
change
in
response
to
ET-1
was
observed
.

Mean
circulatory
filling
pressure
,
an
in
vivo
measure
of
venomotor
tone
,
was
not
elevated
in
LNNA
hypertension
at
1
or
2
weeks
after
LNNA
.

The
superoxide
scavenger
tempol

(
30
,
100
,
and
300
micromol
kg(-1
)
,
IV
)
did
not
change
arterial
pressure
in
control
rats
but
caused
a
dose
-
dependent
decrease
in
LNNA
rats
(
-18
+
/-
8
,
-26
+
/-
15
,
and
-54
+
/-
11
mm
Hg
)
.

Similarly
,
ganglionic
blockade
with
hexamethonium
caused
a
significantly
greater
fall
in
LNNA
hypertensive
rats
(
76
+
/-

9
mm
Hg
)
compared
with
control
rats
(
35
+
/-

10
mm
Hg
)
.

Carotid
arteries
,
vena
cava
,
and
sympathetic
ganglia
from
LNNA
rats
had
higher
basal
levels
of
superoxide
compared
with
those
from
control
rats
.

These
data
suggest
that
while
NO
deficiency
increases
oxidative
stress
and
sympathetic
activity
in
both
arterial
and
venous
vessels
,
the
impact
on
veins
does
not
make
a
major
contribution
to
this
form
of
hypertension
.

Association
of
DRD2
polymorphisms
and
chlorpromazine
-induced
extrapyramidal
syndrome
in
Chinese
schizophrenic
patients
.

AIM
:
Extrapyramidal
syndrome

(
EPS
)
is
most
commonly
affected
by
typical
antipsychotic
drugs
that
have
a
high
affinity
with
the
D2
receptor
.

Recently
,
many
research
groups
have
reported
on
the
positive
relationship
between
the
genetic
variations
in
the
DRD2
gene
and
the
therapeutic
response
in
schizophrenia
patients
as
a
result
of
the
role
of
variations
in
the
receptor
in
modulating
receptor
expression
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluate
the
role
DRD2
plays
in
chlorpromazine
-induced

EPS
in
schizophrenic
patients
.

METHODS
:

We
identified
seven
SNP(single
nucleotide
polymorphism
)

(
-141Cins

>
del
,
TaqIB
,
TaqID
,
Ser311Cys
,
rs6275
,
rs6277
and
TaqIA
)
in
the
DRD2
gene
in
146
schizophrenic
inpatients
(
59
with
EPS
and
87
without
EPS
according
to
the
Simpson
-
Angus
Scale
)
treated
with
chlorpromazine
after
8
weeks
.

The
alleles
of
all
loci
were
determined
by
PCR
(
polymerase
chain
reaction
)
.

RESULTS
:

Polymorphisms
TaqID
,
Ser311Cys
and
rs6277
were
not
polymorphic
in
the
population
recruited
in
the
present
study
.

No
statistical
significance
was
found
in
the
allele
distribution
of
-141Cins
>
del
,
TaqIB
,
rs6275
and
TaqIA
or
in
the
estimated
haplotypes
(
constituted
by
TaqIB
,
rs6275
and
TaqIA
)
in
linkage
disequilibrium
between
the
two
groups
.

CONCLUSION
:

Our
results
did
not
lend
strong
support
to
the
view
that
the
genetic
variation
of
the
DRD2
gene
plays
a
major
role
in
the
individually
variable
adverse
effect
induced
by
chlorpromazine
,
at
least
in
Chinese
patients
with
schizophrenia
.

Our
results
confirmed
a
previous
study
on
the
relationship
between
DRD2
and
EPS
in
Caucasians
.

susceptibility
to
subsequent
pilocarpine
-induced

seizures
in
the
rat
.

Regular
motor
activity
has
many
benefits
for
mental
and
physical
condition
but
its
implications
for
epilepsy
are
still
controversial
.

In
order
to
elucidate
this
problem
,
we
have
studied
the
effect
of
long
-
term
physical
activity
on
susceptibility
to
subsequent
seizures
.

Male
Wistar
rats
were
subjected
to
repeated
training
sessions
in
a
treadmill
and
swimming
pool
.

Thereafter
,
seizures
were
induced
by
pilocarpine
injections
in
trained
and
non
-
trained
control
groups
.

During
the
acute
period
of
status
epilepticus
,
we
measured
:
(
1
)
the
latency
of
the
first
motor
sign
,
(
2
)
the
intensity
of
seizures
,
(
3
)
the
time
when
it
occurred
within
the
6-h
observation
period
,
and
(
4
)
the
time
when
the
acute
period
ended
.

All
these
behavioral
parameters
showed
statistically
significant
changes
suggesting
that
regular
physical
exercises
decrease
susceptibility
to
subsequently
induced
seizures
and
ameliorate
the
course
of
experimentally
induced
status
epilepticus
.

Tonic
dopaminergic
stimulation

impairs
associative
learning
in
healthy
subjects
.

Endogenous
dopamine
plays
a
central
role
in
salience
coding
during
associative
learning
.

Administration
of
the
dopamine
precursor
levodopa
enhances
learning
in
healthy
subjects
and
stroke
patients
.

Because
levodopa
increases
both
phasic
and
tonic
dopaminergic
neurotransmission
,
the
critical
mechanism
mediating
the
enhancement
of
learning
is
unresolved
.

We
here
probed
how
selective
tonic
dopaminergic
stimulation
affects
associative
learning
.

Forty
healthy
subjects
were
trained
in
a
novel
vocabulary
of
45
concrete
nouns
over
the
course
of
5
consecutive
training
days
in
a
prospective
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
design
.

Subjects
received
the
tonically
stimulating
dopamine
-receptor
agonist

pergolide
(
0.1
mg
)
vs
placebo
120
min
before
training
on
each
training
day
.

The
dopamine
agonist
significantly
impaired
novel
word
learning
compared
to
placebo
.

This
learning
decrement
persisted
up
to
the
last
follow
-
up
4
weeks
post
-
training
.

Subjects
treated
with
pergolide
also
showed
restricted
emotional
responses
compared
to
the
PLACEBO
group
.

The
extent
of
'
flattened
'
affect
with
pergolide
was
related
to
the
degree
of
learning
inhibition
.

These
findings
suggest
that
tonic
occupation
of
dopamine
receptors
impairs
learning
by
competition
with
phasic
dopamine
signals
.

Thus
,
phasic
signaling
seems
to
be
the
critical
mechanism
by
which
dopamine
enhances
associative
learning
in
healthy
subjects
and
stroke
patients
.

Minocycline
-induced
vasculitis
fulfilling
the
criteria
of
polyarteritis
nodosa
.

A
47-year
-
old
man
who
had
been
taking
minocycline
for
palmoplantar
pustulosis
developed

fever
,
myalgias
,
polyneuropathy
,
and
testicular
pain
,
with
elevated
C
-
reactive
protein
(
CRP
)
.

Neither
myeloperoxidase-
nor
proteinase-3-antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody
was
positive
.

These
manifestations
met
the
American
College
of
Rheumatology
1990
criteria
for
the
classification
of
polyarteritis
nodosa
.

Stopping
minocycline
led
to
amelioration
of
symptoms
and
normalization
of
CRP
level
.

To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
second
case
of
minocycline
-induced
vasculitis
satisfying
the
criteria
.

Differential
diagnosis
for
drug
-
induced
disease
is
invaluable
even
for
patients
with
classical
polyarteritis
nodosa
.

Intramuscular
hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
combined
with
lamivudine
in
prevention
of
hepatitis
B
recurrence
after
liver
transplantation
.

BACKGROUND
:

Combined
hepatitis
B
immune
globulin
(
HBIg
)
and

lamivudine
in
prophylaxis
of
the
recurrence
of
hepatitis
B

after
liver
transplantation
has
significantly
improved
the
survival
of
HBsAg
positive
patients
.

This
study
was
undertaken
to
evaluate
the
outcomes
of
liver
transplantation
for
patients
with
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
.

METHODS
:

A
retrospective
chart
analysis
and
a
review
of
the
organ
transplant
database
identified
51
patients
(
43
men
and
8
women
)
transplanted
for
benign
HBV
-
related
cirrhotic
diseases
between
June
2002
and
December
2004
who
had
survived
more
than
3
months
.

HBIg
was
administered
intravenously
during
the
first
week
and
intramuscularly
thereafter
.

RESULTS
:

At
a
median
follow
-
up
of
14.1
months
,
the
overall
recurrence
rate
in
the
51
patients
was
3.9
%
(
2/51
)
.

The
overall
patient
survival
was
88.3
%
,
and
82.4
%
after
1
and
2
years
,
respectively
.

A
daily
oral
dose
of
100
mg
lamivudine
for
2
weeks
before
transplantation
for
10
patients
enabled
57.1
%
(
4/7
)
and
62.5
%
(
5/8
)
of
HBV
-
DNA
and
HBeAg
positive
patients
respectively
to
convert
to
be
negative
.

Intramuscular
HBIg
was
well
tolerated
in
all
patients
.

CONCLUSION
:

Lamivudine
combined
with
intramuscular
HBIg
can
effectively
prevent
allograft
from
the
recurrence
of
HBV
after
liver
transplantation
.

Anticonvulsant

is
a

drug
,
now
in
Phase

,
designed
with
the
aim
of
improving
efficacy
and
safety
in
comparison
with
the
structurally
related
drugs
carbamazepine

(
CBZ
)
and
oxcarbazepine

(
OXC
)
.

We
have
studied
the
effects
of
oral
treatment
with
eslicarbazepine
acetate
on
a
whole
-
animal
model
in
which
partial
seizures
can
be
elicited
repeatedly
on
different
days
without
changes
in
threshold
or
seizure
patterns
.

In
the
animals
treated
with
threshold
doses
of
picrotoxin
,
the
average
number
of
seizures
was
2.3+/-1.2
,
and
average
seizure
duration
was
39.5+/-8.4s
.

Pre
-
treatment
with
a
dose
of
30
mg
/
kg
2h
before
picrotoxin
microperfusion
prevented

seizures
in
the
75
%
of
the
rats
.

Lower
doses
(
3
and
10mg
/
kg
)
did
not
suppress
seizures
,
however
,
after
administration
of
10mg
/
kg
,
significant
reductions
in
seizures
duration
(
24.3+/-6.8s
)
and
seizure
number
(
1.6+/-0.34
)
were
found
.

No
adverse
effects
of
eslicarbazepine
acetate
were
observed
in
the
behavioral
/
EEG
patterns
studied
,
including
sleep
/
wakefulness

Acute
renal
failure
associated
with
prolonged
intake
of
slimming
pills
containing
anthraquinones
.

Chinese
herbal
medicine
preparations
are
widely
available
and
often
regarded
by
the
public
as
natural
and
safe
remedies
for
a
variety
of
medical
conditions
.

Nephropathy
caused
by
Chinese
herbs
has
previously
been
reported
,
usually
involving
the
use
of
aristolochic
acids
.

We
report
a
23-year
-
old
woman
who
developed
acute
renal
failure
following
prolonged
use
of
a
proprietary
Chinese
herbal
slimming
pill
that
contained
anthraquinone
derivatives
,
extracted
from
Rhizoma
Rhei
(
rhubarb
)
.

The
renal
injury
was
probably
aggravated
by
the
concomitant
intake
of
a
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
,
diclofenac
.

Renal
pathology
was
that
of
hypocellular
interstitial
fibrosis
.

Spontaneous
renal
recovery
occurred
upon
cessation
of
the
slimming
pills
,
but
mild
interstitial
fibrosis
and
tubular
atrophy
was
still
evident
histologically
4
months
later
.

Although
a
causal
relationship
between
the
use
of
an
anthraquinone
-containing
herbal
agent
and
renal
injury
remains
to
be
proven
,
phytotherapy
-
associated
interstitial
nephropathy
should
be
considered
in
patients
who
present
with
unexplained
renal
failure
.

Chloroacetaldehyde
as
a
sulfhydryl
reagent
:
the
role
of
critical
thiol
groups
in
ifosfamide
nephropathy
.

Chloroacetaldehyde

(
CAA
)
is
a
metabolite
of
the
alkylating
agent
ifosfamide

(
IFO
)
and
putatively
responsible
for
renal
damage
following
anti-
tumor
therapy
with
IFO
.

Depletion
of
sulfhydryl

(
SH
)
groups
has
been
reported
from
cell
culture
,
animal
and
clinical
studies
.

In
this
work
the
effect
of
CAA
on
human
proximal
tubule
cells
in
primary
culture
(
hRPTEC
)
was
investigated
.

Toxicity
of
CAA
was
determined
by
protein
content
,
cell
number
,
LDH
release
,
trypan
blue
exclusion
assay
and
caspase-3
activity
.

Free
thiols
were
measured
by
the
method
of
Ellman
.

CAA
reduced
hRPTEC
cell
number
and
protein
,
induced
a
loss
in
free
intracellular
thiols
and
an
increase
in
necrosis
markers
.

CAA
but
not
acrolein
inhibited
the
cysteine
proteases
caspase-3
,
caspase-8
and
cathepsin
B.
Caspase
activation
by
cisplatin
was
inhibited
by
CAA
.

In
cells
stained
with
fluorescent
dyes
targeting
lysosomes
,
CAA
induced
an
increase
in
lysosomal
size
and
lysosomal
leakage
.

The
effects
of
CAA
on
cysteine
protease
activities
and
thiols
could
be
reproduced
in
cell
lysate
.

Acidification
,
which
slowed
the
reaction
of
CAA
with
thiol
donors
,
could
also
attenuate
effects
of
CAA
on
necrosis
markers
,
thiol
depletion
and
cysteine
protease
inhibition
in
living
cells
.

Thus
,
CAA
directly
reacts
with
cellular
protein
and
non
-
protein
thiols
,
mediating
its
toxicity
on
hRPTEC
.

This
effect
can
be
reduced
by
acidification
.

Therefore
,
urinary
acidification
could
be
an
option
to
prevent
IFO
nephropathy
in
patients
.

Stereological
methods
reveal
the
robust
size
and
stability
of
ectopic
hilar
granule
cells
after

pilocarpine
-induced
status
epilepticus
in
the
adult
rat
.

Following

status
epilepticus
in
the
rat
,
dentate
granule
cell
neurogenesis
increases
greatly
,
and
many
of
the
new
neurons
appear
to
develop
ectopically
,
in
the
hilar
region
of
the
hippocampal
formation
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
the
ectopic
hilar
granule
cells
could
contribute
to
the
spontaneous
seizures
that
ultimately
develop
after
status
epilepticus
.

However
,
the
population
has
never
been
quantified
,
so
it
is
unclear
whether
it
is
substantial
enough
to
have
a
strong
influence
on
epileptogenesis
.

To
quantify
this
population
,
the
total
number
of
ectopic
hilar
granule
cells
was
estimated
using
unbiased
stereology
at
different
times
after
pilocarpine

-induced
status
epilepticus
.

The
number
of
hilar
neurons
immunoreactive
for
Prox-1
,
a
granule
-
cell
-
specific
marker
,
was
estimated
using
the
optical
fractionator
method
.

The
results
indicate
that
the
size
of
the
hilar
ectopic
granule
cell
population
after
status
epilepticus
is
substantial
,
and
stable
over
time
.

Interestingly
,
the
size
of
the
population
appears
to
be
correlated
with
the
frequency
of
behavioral
seizures
,
because
animals
with
more
ectopic
granule
cells
in
the
hilus
have
more
frequent
behavioral
seizures
.

The
hilar
ectopic
granule
cell
population
does
not
appear
to
vary
systematically
across
the
septotemporal
axis
,
although
it
is
associated
with
an
increase
in
volume
of
the
hilus
.

The
results
provide
new
insight
into
the
potential
role
of
ectopic
hilar
granule
cells
in
the
pilocarpine
model
of
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
.

A
prospective
,
open
-
label
trial
of
galantamine
in
autistic
disorder
.

OBJECTIVE
:

Post
-
mortem
studies
have
reported
abnormalities
of
the
cholinergic
system
in
autism
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
use
of
galantamine
,
an
acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor
and
nicotinic
receptor
modulator
,
in
the
treatment
of
interfering
behaviors
in
children
with
autism
.

METHODS
:

Thirteen
medication
-
free
children
with
autism

(
mean
age
,
8.8
+
/-

3.5
years
)
participated
in
a
12-week
,
open
-
label
trial
of
galantamine
.

Patients
were
rated
monthly
by
parents
on
the
Aberrant
Behavior
Checklist
(
ABC
)
and
the
Conners
'
Parent
Rating
Scale
-
Revised
,
and
by
a
physician
using
the
Children
's
Psychiatric
Rating
Scale
and
the
Clinical
Global
Impressions
scale
.

RESULTS
:

Patients
showed
a
significant
reduction
in
parent
-
rated
irritability
and
social
withdrawal
on
the
ABC
as
well
as
significant
improvements
in
emotional
lability
and
inattention
on
the
Conners
'
Parent
Rating
Scale
--
Revised
.

Similarly
,
clinician
ratings
showed
reductions
in
the
anger
subscale
of
the
Children
's
Psychiatric
Rating
Scale
.

Eight
of
13
participants
were
rated
as
responders
on
the
basis
of
their
improvement
scores
on
the
Clinical
Global
Impressions
scale
.

Overall
,
galantamine
was
well
-
tolerated
,
with
no
significant
adverse
effects
apart
from
headaches
in
one
patient
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
this
open
trial
,
galantamine
was
well
-
tolerated
and
appeared
to
be
beneficial
for
the
treatment
of
interfering
behaviors
in
children
with
autism
,
particularly
aggression
,
behavioral
dyscontrol
,
and
inattention
.

Further
controlled
trials
are
warranted
.

.

OBJECTIVE
:

The
authors
compared
4-month
treatment
outcomes
for
olanzapine
versus
risperidone
in
patients
with
first
-
episode
schizophrenia
spectrum
disorders
.

METHOD
:

One
hundred
twelve
subjects
(
70
%
male
;
mean
age=23.3
years
[
SD
=
5.1
]
)
with
first
-
episode
schizophrenia
(
75
%
)
,
schizophreniform
disorder
(
17
%
)
,
or
schizoaffective
disorder
(
8
%
)
were
randomly
assigned
to
treatment
with
olanzapine

(
2.5
-
20
mg
/
day
)
or
risperidone
(
1
-
6
mg
/
day
)
.

RESULTS
:

Response
rates
did
not
significantly
differ
between
olanzapine

(
43.7
%
,
95
%
CI=28.8%-58.6
%
)
and
risperidone
(
54.3
%
,
95
%
CI=39.9%-68.7
%
)
.

Among
those
responding
to
treatment
,
more
subjects
in
the
olanzapine
group
(
40.9
%
,
95
%
CI=16.8%-65.0
%
)
than
in
the
risperidone
group
(
18.9
%
,
95
%
CI=0%-39.2
%
)
had
subsequent
ratings
not
meeting
response
criteria
.

Negative
symptom
outcomes
and
measures
of
parkinsonism
and
akathisia
did
not
differ
between
medications
.

Extrapyramidal
symptom
severity
scores
were
1.4
(
95
%
CI=1.2
-
1.6
)
with
risperidone
and
1.2
(
95
%

CI=1.0
-
1.4
)
with

olanzapine
.

Significantly
more
weight
gain
occurred
with
olanzapine
than
with
risperidone
:
the
increase
in
weight
at
4
months
relative
to
baseline
weight
was
17.3
%
(
95
%
CI=14.2%-20.5
%
)
with

olanzapine
and
11.3
%
(
95
%
CI=8.4%-14.3
%
)
with

risperidone
.

Body
mass
index
at
baseline
and
at
4
months
was
24.3
(
95
%
CI=22.8
-
25.7
)
versus
28.2
(
95
%
CI=26.7
-
29.7
)
with
olanzapine
and
23.9
(
95
%
CI=22.5
-
25.3
)
versus
26.7
(
95
%
CI=25.2
-
28.2
)
with
risperidone
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Clinical
outcomes
with
risperidone
were
equal
to
those
with
olanzapine
,
and
response
may
be
more
stable
.

Olanzapine
may
have
an
advantage
for
motor
side
effects
.

Both
medications
caused
substantial
rapid
weight
gain
,
but
weight
gain
was
greater
with
olanzapine
.

patients
(
10.5
%
)
and
ocular
adverse
effects
,
in
5
(
6.5
%
)
.

Thirty
-
five
patients
(
13.4
%
)
had
visual
field
abnormalities
,
which
were
attributed
to
hydroxychloroquine
treatment
in
4
patients
(
1.5
%
)
.

Three
of
the
4
patients
were
taking
less
than
6.5
mg
/
kg
per
day
and
all
patients
had
normal
renal
and
liver
function
test
results
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
current
study
used
a
protocol
of
visual
acuity
and
color
vision
assessment
,
funduscopy
,
and
Humphrey
10
-
2
visual
field
testing
and
shows
that
visual
field
defects
appeared
before
any
corresponding
changes
in
any
other
tested
clinical
parameters
;
the
defects
were
reproducible
and
the
test
parameters
were
reliable
.

Patients
taking
hydroxychloroquine
can
demonstrate
a
toxic
reaction
in
the
retina
despite
the
absence
of
known
risk
factors
.

Screening
,
including
Humphrey
10
-
2
visual
field
assessment
,
is
recommended
2
years
after
the
initial
baseline
and
yearly
thereafter
.

Peri
-
operative

atrioventricular
block
as
a
result
of
chemotherapy
with
epirubicin
and
paclitaxel
.

A
47-year
-
old
woman
presented
for
mastectomy
and
immediate
latissimus
dorsi
flap
reconstruction
having
been
diagnosed
with
carcinoma
of
the
breast
6
months
previously
.

In
the
preceding
months
she
had
received
neo
-
adjuvant
chemotherapy
with
epirubicin
,
paclitaxel

(
Taxol
)
and
cyclophosphamide
.

This
had
been
apparently
uncomplicated
and
she
had
maintained
a
remarkably
high
level
of
physical
activity
.

She
was
found
to
be
bradycardic

at
pre
-
operative
assessment
but
had
no
cardiac
symptoms
.

Second
degree
Mobitz
type
II
atrioventricular
block
was
diagnosed
on
electrocardiogram
,
and
temporary
transvenous
ventricular
pacing
instituted
in
the
peri
-
operative
period
.

We
discuss
how
evidence
-
based
guidelines
would
not
have
been
helpful
in
this
case
,
and
how
chemotherapy
can
exhibit
substantial
cardiotoxicity
that
may
develop
over
many
years
.

We
suggest
that
patients
who
have
received
chemotherapy
at
any
time
should
have
a
pre
-
operative
electrocardiogram
even
if
they
are
asymptomatic
.

Risks
and
benefits
of
COX-2
inhibitors
vs
non
-
selective
NSAIDs
:
does
their
cardiovascular
risk
exceed
their
gastrointestinal
benefit
?

A
retrospective
cohort
study
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
risk
of
acute
myocardial
infarction

(
AMI
)
with

COX-2
inhibitors
may
offset
their
gastrointestinal
(
GI
)
benefit
compared
with
non
-
selective
(
NS
)
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
.

We
aimed
to
compare
the
risks
of
hospitalization
for
AMI
and
GI
bleeding
among
elderly
patients
using
COX-2
inhibitors
,
NS
-
NSAIDs
and
acetaminophen
.

METHODS
:

We
conducted
a
retrospective
cohort
study
using
administrative
data
of
patients
>
or
=
65
years
of
age
who
filled
a
prescription
for
NSAID
or
acetaminophen
during
1999
-
2002
.

Outcomes
were
compared
using
Cox
regression
models
with
time
-
dependent
exposures
.

RESULTS
:

Person
-
years
of
exposure
among
non
-
users
of
aspirin
were
:
75,761
to
acetaminophen
,
42,671
to
rofecoxib
65,860
to
celecoxib
,
and
37,495
to

.

Among
users
of
aspirin
,
they
were
:
14,671
to
rofecoxib
,
22,875
to
celecoxib
,
9,832
to
NS

NSAIDs
and
38,048
to

.

Among
non

users
of
aspirin
,
the
adjusted

interval
)
of
hospitalization
for
AMI
/GI
vs
the
acetaminophen
(
with
no

)
group
were
:

rofecoxib
1.27
(
1.13
,
1.42
)
,

celecoxib
0.93
(

,
naproxen
1.59

(

)
,

diclofenac
1.17
(
0.99
,
1.38
)
and
ibuprofen
1.05
(
0.74
,
1.51
)
.

Among
users
of
aspirin
,
they
were
:
rofecoxib
1.73
(
1.52
,
1.98
)
,

celecoxib
1.34
(
1.19

(
0.97
,
1.88
)
and
acetaminophen
1.29
(
1.17
,
1.42
)
.

CONCLUSION
:

Among
non
-
users
of
aspirin
,
naproxen
seemed
to
carry
the
highest
risk
for
AMI
/
GI
bleeding
.

The
AMI
/GI

toxicity
of
celecoxib
was
similar
to
that
of
acetaminophen
and
seemed
to
be
better
than
those
of
rofecoxib
and
NS
-
NSAIDs
.

Among
users
of
aspirin
,
both
celecoxib
and
naproxen
seemed
to
be
the
least
toxic
.

Quinine
-induced
arrhythmia
in
a
patient
with
severe
malaria
.

It
was
reported
that
there
was
a
case
of
severe
malaria
patient
with
jaundice
who
presented
with
arrhythmia

(
premature
ventricular
contraction
)
while
getting
quinine
infusion
was
reported
.

A
man
,
25
years
old
,
was
admitted
to
hospital
with
high

Patient
was
diagnosed
as
severe
malaria
with

and
got
quinine
infusion
in

dextrose
5
%
500
mg/8
hour
.

On
the
second
day
the
patient
had
vomitus
,
diarrhea
,
tinnitus
,
loss
of
hearing
.

After
30
hours
of
quinine
infusion
the
patient
felt
palpitation
and
electrocardiography
(
ECG
)
recording
showed
premature
ventricular
contraction

(
PVC
)

>
5
x
/
minute
,
trigemini
,
constant
type--
sinoatrial
block
,
positive
U
wave
.

He
was
treated
with
lidocaine

50
mg
intravenously
followed
by
infusion
1500
mg
in
dextrose

5%/24
hour
and
potassium
aspartate
tablet
.

Quinine
infusion
was
discontinued
and
changed
with
sulfate
quinine
tablets
.

Three
hours
later
the
patient
felt
better
,
the
frequency
of
PVC
reduced
to
4
-
5
x
/
minute
and
on
the
third
day
ECG
was
normal
,
potassium
level
was
3.34
meq
/

He
was
discharged
on
7th
day
in
good
condition
.

Quinine
,
like
quinidine
,
is
a
chincona
alkaloid
that
has
anti-
arrhythmic
property
,
although
it
also
pro-

arrhythmic
that
can
cause
various
arrhythmias
,
including
severe
arrhythmia
such
as
multiple
PVC
.

Administration
of
parenteral
quinine
must
be
done
carefully
and
with
good
observation
because
of
its
pro-
arrhythmic
effect
,
especially
in
older
patients
who
have
heart
diseases
or
patients
with
electrolyte
disorder

(
hypokalemia
)
which
frequently
occurs
due
to
vomiting
and
or
diarrhea
in
malaria
cases
.

Penicillamine
-related
lichenoid
dermatitis
and
utility
of
zinc
acetate
in
a
Wilson
disease
patient
with
hepatic
presentation
,
anxiety
and
SPECT
abnormalities
.

Wilson
's
disease
is
an
autosomal
recessive
disorder
of
hepatic
copper
metabolism
with
consequent
copper
accumulation
and
toxicity
in
many
tissues
and
consequent
hepatic
,
neurologic
and
psychiatric
disorders
.

We
report
a
case
of
Wilson
's
disease
with
chronic
liver
disease
;
moreover
,
in
our
patient
,
presenting
also
with
high
levels
of
state
anxiety
without
depression
,
99mTc
-
ECD
-
SPECT
showed
cortical
hypoperfusion
in
frontal
lobes
,
more
marked
on
the
left
frontal
lobe
.

During
the
follow
-
up
of
our
patient
,
penicillamine
was
interrupted
after
the
appearance
of
a
lichenoid
dermatitis
,
and
zinc
acetate
permitted
to
continue
the
successful
treatment
of
the
patient
without
side
-
effects
.

In
our
case
the
therapy
with
zinc
acetate
represented
an
effective
treatment
for
a
Wilson
's
disease
patient
in
which
penicillamine
-related
side
effects
appeared
.

The
safety
of
the
zinc
acetate
allowed
us
to
avoid
other
potentially
toxic
chelating
drugs
;
this
observation
is
in
line
with
the
growing
evidence
on
the
efficacy
of
the
drug
in
the
treatment
of
Wilson
's
disease
.

Since
most
of
Wilson
's
disease

penicillamine

-treated
patients
do
not
seem
to
develop
this
skin
lesion
,
it
could
be
conceivable
that
a
specific
genetic
factor
is
involved
in
drug
response
.

Further
studies
are
needed
for
a
better
clarification
of
Wilson
's
disease
therapy
,
and
in
particular
to
differentiate
specific
therapies
for
different
Wilson
's
disease
phenotypes
.

A
dramatic
drop
in
blood
pressure
following
prehospital
GTN
administration
.

A
male
in
his
sixties
with
no
history
of
cardiac
chest
pain
awoke
with
chest
pain
following
an
afternoon
sleep
.

The
patient
did
not
self
medicate
.

The
patient
's
observations
were
within
normal
limits
,
he
was
administered

oxygen
via
a
face
mask
and
glyceryl
trinitrate

(
GTN
)
.

Several
minutes
after
the
GTN
the
patient
experienced
a
sudden
drop
in
blood
pressure
and
heart
rate
,
this
was
rectified
by
atropine
sulphate
and
a
fluid
challenge
.

There
was
no
further
deterioration
in
the
patient
's
condition
during
transport
to
hospital
.

There
are
very
few
documented
case
like
this
in
the
prehospital
scientific
literature
.

The
cause
appears
to
be
the
Bezold
-
Jarish
reflex
,
stimulation
of
the
ventricular
walls
which
in
turn
decreases
sympathetic
outflow
from
the
vasomotor
centre
.

Prehospital
care
providers
who
are
managing
any
patient
with
a
syncopal
episode
that
fails
to
recover
within
a
reasonable
time
frame
should
consider
the
Bezold
-
Jarisch
reflex
as
the
cause
and
manage
the
patient
accordingly
.

Acute

and
cerebral
vasospasm
after
multiagent
chemotherapy
including
PEG
-
asparaginase
and
intrathecal
cytarabine
for
the
treatment
of
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
.

A
7-year
-
old
girl
with
an
unusual
reaction
to
induction
chemotherapy
for
precursor
B
-
cell
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia

(
ALL
)
is
described
.

The
patient
developed

acute
encephalopathy
evidenced
by
behavioral
changes
,
aphasia
,
incontinence
,
visual
hallucinations
,
and
right
-
sided

weakness
with
diffuse
cerebral
vasospasm
on
magnetic

angiography
after
the
administration
of
intrathecal
cytarabine
.

Vincristine
,
dexamethasone
,
and
polyethylene
glycol
-
asparaginase
were
also
administered
before
the
episode
as
part
of
induction
therapy
.

Neurologic
status
returned
to
baseline
within
10
days
of
the
acute
event
,
and

findings
returned
to

Comparison
of
valsartan
/
hydrochlorothiazide
combination
therapy
at
doses
up
to
320/25
mg
versus
monotherapy
:
a
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
study
followed
by
long
-
term
combination
therapy
in
hypertensive
adults
.

BACKGROUND
:

One
third
of
patients
treated
for
hypertension
attain
adequate
blood
pressure
(
BP
)
control
,
and
multidrug
regimens
are
often
required
.

Given
the
lifelong
nature
of
hypertension
,
there
is
a
need
to
evaluate
the
long
-
term
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
higher
doses
of
combination
anti-
hypertensive
therapies
.

OBJECTIVE
:

This
study
investigated
the
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
valsartan

(
VAL
)
or
hydrochlorothiazide

(
HCTZ
)

-monotherapy
and
higher
-
dose
combinations
in
patients
with
essential
hypertension
.

METHODS
:

The
first
part
of
this
study
was
an
8-week
,
multicenter
,
randomized
,
double
-
blind
,
placebo
controlled
,
parallel
-
group
trial
.

Patients
with
essential
hypertension

(
mean
sitting
diastolic
BP
[
MSDBP
]
,
>
or
=
95
mm
Hg
and
110
mm
Hg
)
were
randomized
to
1
of
8
treatment
groups
:
VAL
160
or
320
mg
;
HCTZ
12.5
or
25
mg
;
VAL
/
HCTZ
160/12.5
,
320/12.5
,
or
320/25
mg
;
or
placebo
.

Mean
changes
in
MSDBP
and
mean
sitting
systolic
BP
(
MSSBP
)
were
analyzed
at
the
8-week
core
study
end
point
.

VAL
/
HCTZ
320/12.5
and
320/25
mg
were
further
investigated
in
a
54-week
,
open
-
label
extension
.

Response
was
defined
as
MSDBP
90
mm
Hg
or
a
>
or
=
10
mm
Hg
decrease
compared
to
baseline
.

Control
was
defined
as
MSDBP
90
mm
Hg
compared
with
baseline
.

Tolerability
was
assessed
by
monitoring
adverse
events
at
randomization
and
all
subsequent
study
visits
and
regular
evaluation
of
hematology
and
blood
chemistry
.

RESULTS
:

A
total
of
1346
patients
were
randomized
into
the
8-week
core
study
(
734
men
,
612
women
;
924
white
,
291
black
,
23
Asian
,
108
other
;
mean
age
,
52.7
years
;
mean
weight
,
92.6
kg
)
.

All
active
treatments
were
associated
with
significantly
reduced
MSSBP
and
MSDBP
during
the
core
8-week
study
,
with
each
monotherapy
significantly
contributing
to
the
overall
effect
of
combination
therapy
(
VAL
and
HCTZ
,
P
0.001
)
.

Each
combination
was
associated
with
significantly
greater
reductions
in
MSSBP
and
MSDBP
compared
with
the
monotherapies
and
placebo
(
all
,
P
0.001
)
.

The
mean
reduction
in
MSSBP
/
MSDBP
with
VAL
/
HCTZ

320/25
mg
was
24.7/16.6
mm
Hg
,
compared
with
5.9/7.0
mm
Hg
with
placebo
.

The
reduction
in
MSSBP
was
significantly
greater
with
VAL
/
HCTZ

320/25
mg
compared
with
VAL
/
HCTZ

160/12.5
mg
(
P
0.002
)
.

Rates
of
response
and
BP
control
were
significantly
higher
in
the
groups
that
received
combination
treatment
compared
with
those
that
received
monotherapy
.

The
incidence
of
hypokalemia
was
lower
with
VAL
/
HCTZ
combinations
(
1.8%-6.1
%
)
than
with
HCTZ
monotherapies
(
7.1%-13.3
%
)
.

The
majority
of
adverse
events
in
the
core
study
were
of
mild
to
moderate
severity
.

The
efficacy
and
tolerability
of
VAL
/
HCTZ
combinations
were
maintained
during
the
extension
(
797
patients
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

In
this
study
population
,
combination
therapies
with
VAL
/
HCTZ
were
associated
with
significantly
greater
BP
reductions
compared
with
either
monotherapy
,
were
well
tolerated
,
and
were
associated
with
less
hypokalemia
than
HCTZ
alone
.

Succimer
chelation
improves
learning
,
attention
,
and
arousal
regulation
in
lead

-exposed
rats
but
produces
lasting
cognitive
impairment
in
the
absence
of
lead
exposure
.

BACKGROUND
:

There
is
growing
pressure
for
clinicians
to
prescribe
chelation
therapy
at
only
slightly
elevated
blood
lead
levels
.

However
,
very
few
studies
have
evaluated
whether
chelation
improves
cognitive
outcomes
in
Pb

-exposed
children
,
or
whether
these
agents
have
adverse
effects
that
may
affect
brain
development
in
the
absence
of
Pb
exposure
.

OBJECTIVES
:

The
present
study
was
designed
to
answer
these
questions
,
using
a
rodent
model
of
early
childhood
Pb
exposure
and
treatment
with
succimer
,
a
widely
used
chelating
agent
for
the
treatment
of
Pb
poisoning
.

RESULTS
:

Pb
exposure
produced
lasting
impairments
in
learning
,
attention
,
inhibitory
control
,
and
arousal
regulation
,
paralleling
the
areas
of
dysfunction
seen
in
Pb

-exposed
children
.

Succimer
treatment
of
the
Pb
-exposed
rats
significantly
improved
learning
,
attention
,
and
arousal
regulation
,
although
the
efficacy
of
the
treatment
varied
as
a
function
of
the
Pb
exposure
level
and
the
specific
functional
deficit
.

In
contrast
,
succimer
treatment
of
rats
not
previously
exposed
to
Pb

produced
lasting
and
pervasive
cognitive
and
affective
dysfunction
comparable
in
magnitude
to
that
produced
by
the
higher
Pb
exposure
regimen
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
are
the
first
data
,
to
our
knowledge
,
to
show
that
treatment
with
any
chelating
agent
can
alleviate
cognitive
deficits
due
to
Pb
exposure
.

These
findings
suggest
that
it
may
be
possible
to
identify
a
succimer
treatment
protocol
that
improves
cognitive
outcomes
in
Pb
-exposed
children
.

However
,
they
also
suggest
that
succimer
treatment
should
be
strongly
discouraged
for
children
who
do
not
have
elevated
tissue
levels
of
Pb
or

The
patients
had
no

a
4-week
period
.

In
a
randomized

performed
in
2
occasions
7
days

,
480
mg
caffeine
and
a

were
administered
in
a

were
applied
before
and
after

the
480-mg

.

The
patients
with

were
more
sensitive
to

than
were

.

No
panic

was
observed
after
the

Mitral
annuloplasty
as
a
ventricular
restoration
method
for
the
failing
left
ventricle
:
a
pilot
study
.

BACKGROUND
AND
AIM
OF
THE
STUDY
:

Undersized
mitral
annuloplasty
(
MAP
)
is
effective
in
patients
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy
and
functional
mitral
regurgitation

(
MR
)
since
,
as
well
as
addressing
the
MR
,
the
MAP
may
also
reshape
the
dilated
left
ventricular
(
LV
)
base
.

However
,
the
direct
benefits
of
this
possible
reshaping
on
LV
function
in
the
absence
of
underlying
MR
remain
incompletely
understood
.

The
study
aim
was
to
identify
these
benefits
in
a
canine
model
of
acute
heart
failure
.

METHODS
:

Six
dogs
underwent
MAP
with
a
prosthetic
band
on
the
posterior
mitral
annulus
,
using
four
mattress
sutures
.

The
sutures
were
passed
individually
through
four
tourniquets
and
exteriorized
untied
via
the
left
atriotomy
.

Sonomicrometry
crystals
were
implanted
around
the
mitral
annulus
and
left
ventricle
to
measure
geometry
and
regional
function
.

Acute
heart
failure
was
induced
by
propranolol
and
volume
loading
after
weaning
from
cardiopulmonary
bypass
;
an
absence
of
MR
was
confirmed
by
echocardiography
.

MAP
was
accomplished
by
cinching
the
tourniquets
.

Data
were
acquired
at
baseline
,
after
induction
of
acute
heart
failure
,
and
after
MAP
.

RESULTS
:

MAP
decreased
mitral
annular
dimensions
in
both
commissure
-
commissure
and
septal
-
lateral
directions
.

Concomitantly
,
the
diastolic
diameter
of
the
LV
base
and
LV
sphericity
decreased
(
i.e.
,
improved
)
from
37.4
+
/-

to
35.9

18.6
%
to
65.3
+
/-
18.9
%
(
p
=
0.016
)
,
respectively
.

Decreases
were
evident
in
both
LV
end
-
diastolic
pressure
(
from
17
+
/-
7
to
15
+
/-

6

and
Tau
(
from

/-
8
to

8
ms
,
p

)
,
while
fractional
shortening
at
the
LV
base
increased
from
7.7
+
/-
4.5
%
to
9.4
+
/-

4.5
%
(
p
=
0.045
)
.

After
MAP
,
increases
were
identified
in
both
cardiac
output
(
from
1.54
+
/-
0.57
to
1.65
+
/-
0.57

)
and
Emax
(
from
1.86
+
/-
0.9
to
2.41
+
/-

1.31
mmHg
/

)
.

CONCLUSION

:
The
data
acquired
suggest
that
isolated
MAP
may
have
certain
benefits
on
LV
dimension
/
function
in
acute
heart
failure
,
even
in
the
absence
of
MR
.

However
,
further
investigations
are
warranted
in
a
model
of
chronic
heart
failure
.

Piperacillin

rapidly
reversed
by
high
flux
hemodialysis
in
a
patient
on
peritoneal
dialysis
.

Despite
popular
use
of
piperacillin
,
the
dire
neurotoxicity
associated
with
piperacillin
still
goes
unrecognized
,
leading
to
a
delay
in
appropriate
management
.

We
report
a
57-year
-
old
woman
with
end
-
stage
renal
disease
receiving
continuous
ambulatory
peritoneal
dialysis
(
CAPD
)
,
who
developed
slurred
speech
,
tremor
,
bizarre
behavior
,
progressive
mental
confusion
,
and
2
episodes
of
generalized
tonic
-
clonic
seizure

(
GTCS
)
after
5
doses
of
piperacillin
/
tazobactam

(
2
g/250
mg
)
were
given
for
bronchiectasis
with
secondary
infection
.

The
laboratory
data
revealed
normal
plasma
electrolyte
and
ammonia
levels
but
leukocytosis
.

Neurologic
examinations
showed
dysarthria
and
bilateral
Babinski
sign
.

Computed
tomography
of
brain
and
electroencephalogram
were
unremarkable
.

Despite
the
use
of
antiepileptic
agents
,
another
GTCS
episode
recurred
after
the
sixth
dose
of
piperacillin
/
tazobactam
.

Brain
magnetic
resonance
imaging
did
not
demonstrate
acute
infarction
and
organic
brain
lesions
.

Initiation
of
high
-
flux
hemodialysis
rapidly
reversed
the
neurologic
symptoms
within
4
hours
.

Piperacillin
-induced

encephalopathy
should
be
considered
in
any
uremic
patients
with
unexplained
neurological
manifestations
.

CAPD
is
inefficient
in
removing
piperacillin
,
whereas
hemodialysis
can
rapidly
terminate
the
piperacillin
-induced
encephalopathy
.

Frequency
of
transient
ipsilateral
vocal
cord
paralysis
in
patients
undergoing
carotid
endarterectomy
under
local
anesthesia
.

BACKGROUND
:
Especially
because
of
improvements
in
clinical
neurologic
monitoring
,

carotid
endarterectomy
done
under
local
anesthesia
has
become
the
technique
of
choice
in
several
centers
.

Temporary
ipsilateral
vocal
nerve
palsies
due
to
local
anesthetics
have
been
described
,
however
.

Such
complications
are
most
important
in
situations
where
there
is
a
pre
-
existing
contralateral
paralysis
.

We
therefore
examined
the
effect
of
local
anesthesia
on
vocal
cord
function
to
better
understand
its
possible
consequences
.

METHODS
:

This
prospective
study
included
28
patients
undergoing
carotid
endarterectomy
under
local
anesthesia
.

Vocal
cord
function
was
evaluated
before
,
during
,
and
after
surgery
(
postoperative
day
1
)
using
flexible
laryngoscopy
.

Anesthesia
was
performed
by
injecting
20
to
40
mL
of
a
mixture
of
long
-
acting
(
ropivacaine
)
and
short
-
acting
(
prilocaine
)
anesthetic
.

RESULTS
:

All
patients
had
normal
vocal
cord
function
preoperatively
.

Twelve
patients
(
43
%
)
were
found
to
have
intraoperative
ipsilateral
vocal
cord
paralysis
.

It
resolved
in
all
cases
or
=
24
hours
.

There
were
no
significant
differences
in
operating
time
or
volume
or
frequency
of
anesthetic
administration
in
patients
with
temporary
vocal
cord
paralysis
compared
with
those
without
.

CONCLUSION
:

Local
anesthesia
led
to
temporary
ipsilateral
vocal
cord
paralysis
in
almost
half
of
these
patients
.

Because
pre
-
existing
paralysis
is
of
a
relevant
frequency
(
up
to
3
%
)
,
a
preoperative
evaluation
of
vocal
cord
function
before
carotid
endarterectomy
under
local
anesthesia
is
recommended
to
avoid
intraoperative
bilateral
paralysis
.

In
patients
with
preoperative
contralateral
vocal
cord
paralysis
,
surgery
under
general
anesthesia
should
be
considered
.

Neuroprotective
effects
of
melatonin
upon
the
offspring
cerebellar
cortex
in
the
rat
model
of
BCNU

-induced
cortical
dysplasia
.

Cortical
dysplasia
is
a
malformation
characterized
by
defects
in
proliferation
,
migration
and
maturation
.

This
study
was
designed
to
evaluate
the
alterations
in
offspring
rat
cerebellum
induced
by
maternal
exposure
to
carmustine
-
[
1,3-bis
(
2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure
]

(
BCNU
)
and
to
investigate
the
effects
of
exogenous
melatonin
upon
cerebellar
BCNU

-induced

cortical
dysplasia
,
using
histological
and
biochemical
analyses
.

Pregnant
Wistar
rats
were
assigned
to
five
groups
:
intact
-
control
,
saline
-
control
,
melatonin
-treated
,
BCNU
-exposed
and
BCNU
-exposed
plus
melatonin
.

Rats
were
exposed
to
BCNU
on
embryonic
day
15
and
melatonin
was
given
until
delivery
.

Immuno
/
histochemistry
and
electron
microscopy
were
carried
out
on
the
offspring
cerebellum
,
and
levels
of
malondialdehyde
and
superoxide
dismutase
were
determined
.

Histopathologically
,
typical
findings
were
observed
in
the
cerebella
from
the
control
groups
,
but
the
findings
consistent
with
early
embryonic
development
were
noted
in
BCNU
-exposed
cortical
dysplasia
group
.

There
was
a
marked
increase
in
the
number
of
TUNEL
positive
cells
and
nestin
positive
cells
in
BCNU
-exposed
group
,
but
a
decreased
immunoreactivity
to
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
,
synaptophysin
and
transforming
growth
factor
beta1
was
observed
,
indicating
a
delayed
maturation
,
and
melatonin
significantly
reversed
these
changes
.

Malondialdehyde
level
in

BCNU
-exposed
group
was
higher
than
those
in
control
groups
and
melatonin
decreased
malondialdehyde
levels
in
BCNU
group
(
P<0.01
)
,
while
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
superoxide
dismutase
levels
between
these
groups
.

These
data
suggest
that
exposure
of
animals
to
BCNU
during
pregnancy
leads
to
delayed
maturation
of
offspring
cerebellum
and
melatonin
protects
the
cerebellum
against
the
effects
of
BCNU
.

Myo
-
inositol-1-phosphate

(
MIP
)
synthase
inhibition
:
in
-
vivo
study
in
rats
.

Lithium
and
valproate
are
the
prototypic
mood
stabilizers
and
have
diverse
structures
and
targets
.

Both
drugs
influence
inositol
metabolism
.

Lithium
inhibits
IMPase
and
valproate
inhibits

MIP
synthase
.

This
study
shows
that
MIP
synthase
inhibition
does
not
replicate
or
augment
the
effects
of
lithium
in
the
inositol
sensitive

pilocarpine
-induced

seizures
model
.

This
lack
of
effects
may
stem
from
the
low
contribution
of
de
-
novo
synthesis
to
cellular
inositol
supply
or
to
the
inhibition
of
the
de
-
novo
synthesis
by
lithium
itself
.

Non

deposits
.

Acute
tubulo
-
interstitial
nephritis

(
ATIN
)
is
an
important
cause
of
acute
renal
failure
resulting
from
a
variety
of
insults
,
including
immune
complex
-
mediated
tubulo
-
interstitial
injury
,
but
drugs
such
as
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drugs
(
NSAIDs
)
are
a
far
more
frequent
cause
.

Overall
,
as
an
entity
,
ATIN
remains
under
-
diagnosed
,
as
symptoms
resolve
spontaneously
if
the
medication
is
stopped
.

We
report
on
a
14-year
-
old
boy
who
developed
acute
renal
failure

2
weeks
after
aortic
valve
surgery
.

He
was
put
on
aspirin
following
surgery
and
took
ibuprofen
for
fever
for
nearly
a
week
prior
to
presentation
.

He
then
presented
to
the
emergency
department
feeling
quite
ill
and
was
found
to
have
a
blood
urea
nitrogen

(
BUN
)
concentration
of
of
147
mg
/
dl
,
creatinine
of
15.3
mg
/
dl
and
serum
potassium
of
8.7
mEq
/
l
.

Dialysis
was
immediately
initiated
.

A
kidney
biopsy
showed
inflammatory
infiltrate
consistent
with
ATIN
.

However
,
in
the
tubular
basement
membrane
(
TBM
)
,
very
intense
granular
deposits
of
polyclonal
IgG
and
C3
were
noted
.

He
needed
dialysis
for
2
weeks
and
was
treated
successfully
with
steroids
for
6
months
.

His
renal
recovery
and
disappearance
of
proteinuria
took
a
year
.

In
conclusion
,
this
is
a
first
report
of
NSAIDs
-
associated
ATIN
,
showing
deposits
of
granular
immune
complex
present
only
in
the
TBM
and
not
in
the

secondary
to
a

Rate
of
YMDD
motif
mutants
in
lamivudine

-untreated
Iranian
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
virus
infection
.

BACKGROUND
:

Lamivudine
is
used
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
.

Recent
studies
show
that
the
YMDD
motif
mutants
(
resistant
hepatitis
B
virus
)
occur
as
natural
genome
variability
in
lamivudine
-untreated
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
.

In
this
study
we
aimed
to
determine
the
rate
of
YMDD
motif
mutants
in
lamivudine
-untreated
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
in
Iran
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:

A
total
of
77
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
who
had
not
been
treated
with
lamivudine
were
included
in
the
study
.

Serum
samples
from
patients
were
tested
by
polymerase
chain
reaction
-
restriction
fragment
length
polymorphism
(
PCR
-
RFLP
)
for
detection
of
YMDD
motif
mutants
.

All
patients
were
also
tested
for
liver
enzymes
,
anti
-
HCV
,
HBeAg
,
and
anti
-
HBe
.

RESULTS
:

Of
the
77
patients
enrolled
in
the
study
,
73
%
were
male
and
27
%
were
female
.

Mean
ALT
and
AST
levels
were
124.4+/-73.4
and
103.1+/-81
IU
/
l
,
respectively
.

HBeAg
was
positive
in
40
%
and
anti
-
HBe
in
60
%
of
the
patients
.

Anti
-
HCV
was
negative
in
all
of
them
.

YMDD
motif
mutants
were
not
detected
in
any
of
the
patients
despite
the
liver
enzyme
levels
and
the
presence
of
HBeAg
or
anti
-
HBe
.

CONCLUSION
:

Although
the
natural
occurrence
of
YMDD
motif
mutants
in
lamivudine
-untreated
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
has
been
reported
,
these
mutants
were
not
detected
in
Iranian
lamivudine
-untreated
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
.

nociceptive
input
from
surgical
sites
,
long
-
acting
local
anesthetics
might
directly
modulate
inflammation
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
describe
the
proinflammatory
effects
of
bupivacaine
on
local
prostaglandin
E2
(
PGE2
)
production
and
cyclooxygenase
(
COX
)
gene
expression
that
increases
postoperative
pain
in
human
subjects
.

METHODS
:
Subjects
(
n
=
114
)
undergoing
extraction
of
impacted
third
molars
received
either
2
%
lidocaine
or
0.5
%
bupivacaine
before
surgery
and
either
rofecoxib

50
mg
or
placebo
orally
90
min
before
surgery
and
for
the
following
48
h.
Oral
mucosal
biopsies
were
taken
before
surgery
and
48
h
after
surgery
.

After
extraction
,
a
microdialysis
probe
was
placed
at
the
surgical
site
for
PGE2
and
thromboxane
B2

(
TXB2
)
measurements
.

RESULTS
:

The
bupivacaine
/
rofecoxib
group
reported
significantly
less
pain
,
as
assessed
by
a
visual
analog
scale
,
compared
with
the
other
three
treatment
groups
over
the
first
4

h.
However
,
the
bupivacaine
/placebo
group
reported
significantly
more
pain
at
24
h
and
PGE2
levels
during
the
first
4
h
were
significantly
higher
than
the
other
three
treatment
groups
.

Moreover
,
bupivacaine
significantly
increased
COX-2
gene
expression
at
48
h
as
compared
with
the
lidocaine
/placebo
group
.

Thromboxane
levels
were
not
significantly
affected
by
any
of
the
treatments
,
indicating
that
the
effects
seen
were
attributable
to
inhibition
of
COX-2
,
but
not
COX-1
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

These
results
suggest
that
bupivacaine
stimulates
COX-2
gene
expression
after
tissue
injury
,
which
is
associated
with
higher
PGE2
production
and
pain
after
the
local
anesthetic
effect
dissipates
.

p75NTR
expression
in
rat
urinary
bladder
sensory
neurons
and
spinal

with
cyclophosphamide

-induced

cystitis
.

A
role
for
nerve
growth
factor
(
NGF
)
in
contributing
to
increased
voiding
frequency
and
altered
sensation
from
the
urinary
bladder
has
been
suggested
.

Previous
studies
have
examined
the
expression
and
regulation
of
tyrosine
kinase
receptors
(
Trks
)
in
micturition
reflexes
with
urinary
bladder
inflammation
.

The
present
studies
examine
the
expression
and
regulation
of
another
receptor
known
to
bind
NGF
,
p75(NTR
)
,
after
various
durations
of
bladder
inflammation
induced
by
cyclophosphamide

(
CYP
)
.

CYP
-induced

cystitis
increased
(
P
or
=
0.001
)
p75(NTR
)
expression
in
the
superficial
lateral
and
medial
dorsal
horn
in
L1-L2
and
L6-S1
spinal
segments
.

The
number
of
p75(NTR)-immunoreactive
(
-IR
)
cells
in
the
lumbosacral
dorsal
root

(
DRG
)
also
increased
(
P
or
=
0.05
)
with

CYP
-induced

cystitis
(
acute
,
intermediate
,
and
chronic
)
.

Quantitative
,
real

also
demonstrated
significant
increases
(
P
or
=
0.01
)
in
p75(NTR
)

mRNA
in
DRG
with
intermediate
and
chronic
CYP
-induced
cystitis
.

Retrograde
dye
-
tracing
techniques
with
Fastblue
were
used
to
identify
presumptive
bladder
afferent
cells
in
the
lumbosacral
DRG
.

In
bladder
afferent
cells
in
DRG
,
p75(NTR)-IR
was
also
increased
(
P
or
=
0.01
)
with
cystitis
.

In
addition
to
increases
in
p75(NTR)-IR
in
DRG
cell
bodies
,
increases
(
P
or
=
0.001
)
in
pericellular
(
encircling
DRG
cells
)

p75(NTR)-IR
in
DRG
also
increased
.

Confocal
analyses
demonstrated
that
pericellular

p75(NTR)-IR
was
not
colocalized
with
the
glial
marker
,
glial
fibrillary
acidic
protein
(
GFAP
)
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
p75(NTR
)
expression
in
micturition
reflexes
is
present
constitutively
and
modified
by
bladder
inflammation
.

The
functional
significance
of
p75(NTR
)
expression
in
micturition
reflexes
remains
to
be
determined
.

Azathioprine
-induced
suicidal
erythrocyte
death
.

BACKGROUND
:

Azathioprine
is
widely
used
as
an
immunosuppressive
drug
.

The
side
effects
of
azathioprine
include
anemia
,
which
has
been
attributed
to
bone
marrow
suppression
.

Alternatively
,
anemia
could
result
from
accelerated
suicidal
erythrocyte
death
or
eryptosis
,
which
is
characterized
by
exposure
of
phosphatidylserine

(
PS
)
at
the
erythrocyte
surface
and
by
cell
shrinkage
.

METHODS
:

The
present
experiments
explored
whether
azathioprine
influences
eryptosis
.

According
to
annexin
V
binding
,
erythrocytes
from
patients
indeed
showed
a
significant
increase
of
PS
exposure
within
1
week
of
treatment
with
azathioprine
.

In
a
second
series
,
cytosolic
Ca
2
+
activity
(
Fluo3
fluorescence
)
,
cell
volume
(
forward
scatter
)
,
and

PS
-exposure

(
annexin
V
binding
)
were
determined
by
FACS
analysis
in
erythrocytes
from
healthy
volunteers
.

RESULTS
:

Exposure
to
azathioprine

(
>
or
=
2
microg
/
mL
)
for
48
hours
increased
cytosolic
Ca
2
+
activity
and
annexin
V
binding
and
decreased
forward
scatter
.

The
effect
of
azathioprine
on
both
annexin
V

binding
and
forward
scatter

was
significantly
blunted
in
the
nominal
absence
of
extracellular
Ca
2
+
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Azathioprine
triggers
suicidal
erythrocyte
death
,
an
effect
presumably
contributing
to
azathioprine

-induced

anemia
.

Clinical
comparison
of
cardiorespiratory
effects
during
unilateral
and
conventional
spinal
anaesthesia
.

BACKGROUND
:

Spinal
anaesthesia
is
widely
employed
in
clinical
practice
but
has
the
main
drawback
of
post
-
spinal
block
hypotension
.

Efforts
must
therefore
continue
to
be
made
to
obviate
this
setback
OBJECTIVE
:

To
evaluate
the
cardiovascular
and
respiratory
changes
during
unilateral
and
conventional
spinal
anaesthesia
.

METHODS
:

With
ethical
approval
,
we
studied
74
American
Society
of
Anesthesiologists
(
ASA
)
,
physical
status
class
1
and
2
patients
scheduled
for
elective
unilateral
lower
limb
surgery
.

Patients
were
randomly
allocated
into
one
of
two
groups
:
lateral
and
conventional
spinal
anaesthesia
groups
.

In
the
lateral
position
with
operative
side
down
,
patients
recived
10
mg
(
2mls
)
of
0.5
%
hyperbaric
bupivacaine
through
a
25-gauge
spinal
needle
.

Patients
in
the
unilateral
group
were
maintained
in
the
lateral
position
for
15
minutes
following
spinal
injection
while
those
in
the
conventional
group
were
turned
supine
immediately
after
injection
.

Blood
pressure
,
heart
rate
,
respiratory
rate
and
oxygen
saturation
were
monitored
over
1
hour
.

RESULTS
:

Three
patients
(
8.1
%
)
in
the
unilateral
group
and
5
(
13.5
%
)
in
the
conventional
group
developed

hypotension
,
P=
0.71
.

Four
(
10.8
%
)

patients
in
the
conventional
group
and
1
(
2.7
%
)
in
the
unilateral
group
,
P=
0.17
required
epinephrine
infusion
to
treat
hypotension
.

Patients
in
the
conventional
group
had
statistically
significant
greater
fall
in
the
systolic
blood
pressures
at
15
,
30
and
45
minutes
when
compared
to
the
baseline
(
P=
0.003
,
0.001
and
0.004
)
.

The
mean
respiratory
rate
and
oxygen
saturations
in
the
two
groups
were
similar
.

CONCLUSION
:

Compared
to
conventional
spinal
anaesthesia
,
unilateral
spinal
anaesthesia
was
associated
with
fewer
cardiovascular
perturbations
.

Also
,
the
type
of
spinal
block
instituted
affected
neither
the
respiratory
rate
nor
the
arterial
oxygen
saturation
.

Spectrum

,
generic
highly
active
antiretroviral

we
examined
the

who
received
a

of
3
months
of

was
observed
in
5.4

)
in
3.5
%
of

)
.

Women
were
significantly
more
likely
to
experience
lactic
acidosis
,
while
men
were
significantly
more
likely
to
experience
immune

syndrome

(
p

)
.

Among
the
patients
with
1
year
of
follow

,
NVP
therapy
was
significantly
associated
with
developing
rash
and
d4

)
.

Anemia
and
hepatitis
often
occur
within
12
weeks
of
initiating
generic
HAART
.

Frequent
and
early
monitoring
for
these
toxicities
is
warranted
in
developing
countries
where
generic

is
increasingly
available
.

Thalidomide
and
sensory
neurotoxicity
:
a
neurophysiological
study
.

BACKGROUND
:

Recent
studies
confirmed
a
high
incidence
of
sensory
axonal
neuropathy
in
patients
treated
with
different
doses
of
thalidomide
.

The
study
's
aims
were
to
measure
variations
in
sural
nerve
sensory
action
potential
(
SAP
)
amplitude
in
patients
with
refractory
cutaneous
lupus
erythematosus

(
CLE
)
treated
with
thalidomide
and
use
these
findings
to
identify
the
neurotoxic
potential
of
thalidomide
and
the
recovery
capacity
of
sensory
fibres
after
discontinuation
of
treatment
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS
:
Clinical
and
electrophysiological
data
in
12
female
patients
with
CLE
during
treatment
with
thalidomide
and
up
to
47
months
after
discontinuation
of
treatment
were
analysed
.

Sural
nerve
SAP
amplitude
reduction
>
or
=
40
%
was
the
criteria
for
discontinuing
therapy
.

RESULTS
:

During
treatment
,
11
patients
showed
a
reduction
in
sural
nerve
SAP
amplitude
compared
to
baseline
values
(
9
with
a
reduction
>
or
=
50
%
and
2
50
%
)
.

One
patient
showed
no
changes
in
SAP
amplitude
.

Five
patients
complained
of
paresthesias
and
leg
cramps
.

After
thalidomide
treatment
,
sural
SAP
amplitude
recovered
in
3
patients
.

At
detection
of
reduction
in
sural
nerve
SAP
amplitude
,
the
median
thalidomide

cumulative
dose
was
21.4
g.

The
threshold
neurotoxic
dosage
is
lower
than
previously
reported
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Sural
nerve
SAP
amplitude
reduction
is
a
reliable
and
sensitive
marker
of
degeneration
and
recovery
of
sensory
fibres
.

This
electrophysiological
parameter
provides
information
about
subclinical
neurotoxic
potential
of
thalidomide
but
is
not
helpful
in
predicting
the
appearance
of
sensory
symptoms
.

Amiodarone
-related
pulmonary
mass
and
unique
membranous
glomerulonephritis
in
a
patient
with
valvular
heart
disease
:

Diagnostic
pitfall
and
new
findings
.

Amiodarone
is
an
anti-
arrhythmic
drug
for
life
-
threatening
tachycardia
,
but
various
adverse
effects
have
been
reported
.

Reported
herein
is
an
autopsy
case
of
valvular
heart
disease
,
in
a
patient
who
developed
a
lung
mass
(
1.5
cm
in
diameter
)
and
proteinuria
(
2.76
g
/
day
)
after
treatment
with
amiodarone
for
a
long
time
.

The
lung
mass
was
highly
suspected
to
be
lung
cancer
on
CT
and
positron
emission
tomography
,
but
histologically
the
lesion
was
composed
of
lymphoplasmacytic
infiltrates
in
alveolar
walls
and
intra
-
alveolar
accumulation
of
foamy
macrophages
containing
characteristic
myelinoid
bodies
,
indicating
that
it
was
an
amiodarone
-related
lesion
.

In
addition
,
the
lung
tissue
had
unevenly
distributed
hemosiderin
deposition
,
and
abnormally
tortuous
capillaries
were
seen
in
the
mass
and
in
heavily
hemosiderotic
lung
portions
outside
the
mass
.

In
the
kidneys
,
glomeruli
had
membrane
spikes
,
prominent
swelling
of
podocytes
and
subepithelial
deposits
,
which
were
sometimes
large
and
hump
-
like
.

Autoimmune
diseases
,
viral
hepatitis
,
malignant
neoplasms
or
other
diseases
with
a
known
relationship
to
membranous
glomerulonephritis
were
not
found
.

The
present
case
highlights
the
possibility
that
differential
diagnosis
between
an

amiodarone
-related

pulmonary
lesion
and
a
neoplasm
can
be
very
difficult
radiologically
,
and
suggests
that
membranous
glomerulonephritis
might
be
another
possible
complication
of
amiodarone
treatment
.

Risk
of
coronary
artery
disease
associated
with
initial
sulphonylurea
treatment
of
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
:
a
matched
case
-
control
study
.

AIMS
:

This
study
sought
to
assess
the
risk
of
developing
coronary
artery
disease

(
CAD
)
associated
with
initial
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
with
different
sulphonylureas
.

METHODS
:

In
type
2
diabetic
patients
,
cases
who
developed
CAD
were
compared
retrospectively
with
controls
that
did
not
.

The
20-year
risk
of
CAD
at
diagnosis
of
diabetes
,
using
the
UKPDS
risk
engine
,
was
used
to
match
cases
with
controls
.

RESULTS
:

The
76
cases
of
CAD
were
compared
with
152
controls
.

The
hazard
of
developing
CAD

(
95
%
CI
)
associated
with
initial
treatment
increased
by
2.4-fold
(
1.3
-
4.3
,
P=0.004
)
with
glibenclamide
;
2-fold
(
0.9
-
4.6
,
P=0.099
)
with
glipizide
;
2.9-fold
(
1.6
-
5.1
,
P=0.000
)
with
either
,
and
was
unchanged
with
metformin
.

The
hazard
decreased
0.3-fold

(
0.7
-
1.7
,
P=0.385
)
with
glimepiride
,
0.4-fold
(
0.7
-
1.3
,
P=0.192
)
with
gliclazide
,
and
0.4-fold
(
0.7
-
1.1
,
P=0.09
)
with
either
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Initiating
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes
with
glibenclamide
or
glipizide
is
associated
with
increased
risk
of
CAD
in
comparison
to
gliclazide
or
glimepiride
.

If
confirmed
,
this
may
be
important
because
most
Indian
patients
receive
the
cheaper
older
sulphonylureas
,
and
present
guidelines
do
not
distinguish
between
individual
agents
.

processed
for
morphological
studies
.

RESULTS
:

Short
-
term
losartan
treatment
,
besides
antihypertensive
effect
,
improved
glomerular
filtration
rate
and
ameliorated

glomerulosclerosis
resulting
in
decreased
proteinuria
.

Prolonged
treatment
with
losartan
showed
further
reduction
of
glomerulosclerosis
associated
with
reduced
progression
of
tubular
atrophy
and
interstitial
fibrosis
,
thus
preventing
heavy
proteinuria
and
chronic
renal
failure
.

Losartan
reduced

uraemia
and
increased
urea
clearance
in
advanced
ADR
nephropathy
in
SHR
.

Histological
examination
showed
that
losartan
could
prevent
tubular
atrophy
,
interstitial
infiltration
and
fibrosis
in
ADR
nephropathy
.

CONCLUSION
:

Losartan
reduces
the
rate
of
progression
of
ADR
-induced

focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
to
end
-
stage
renal
disease
in
SHR
.

The
risks
of
aprotinin
and
tranexamic
acid
in
cardiac
surgery
:
a
one
-
year
follow
-
up
of
1188
consecutive
patients
.

BACKGROUND
:

Our
aim
was
to
investigate
postoperative
complications
and
mortality
after
administration
of
aprotinin
compared
to
tranexamic
acid
in
an
unselected
,
consecutive
cohort
.

METHODS
:
Perioperative
data
from
consecutive
cardiac
surgery
patients
were
prospectively
collected
between
September
2005
and
June
2006
in
a
university
-
affiliated
clinic
(
n
=
1188
)
.

During
the
first
5
mo
,
596
patients
received
aprotinin
(
Group
A
)
;
in
the
next
5
mo
,
592
patients
were
treated
with
tranexamic
acid

(
Group
T
)
.

Except
for
antifibrinolytic
therapy
,
the
anesthetic
and
surgical
protocols
remained
unchanged
.

RESULTS
:

The
pre-
and
intraoperative
variables
were
comparable
between
the
treatment
groups
.

Postoperatively
,
a
significantly
higher
incidence
of
seizures
was
found
in
Group
T
(
4.6
%
vs
1.2
%
,
P
0.001
)
.

This
difference
was
also
significant
in
the
primary
valve
surgery
and
the
high
risk
surgery
subgroups
(
7.9
%
vs
1.2
%
,
P
=
0.003
;
7.3
%
vs
2.4
%
,
P
=
0.035
,
respectively
)
.

Persistent
atrial
fibrillation
(
7.9
%
vs
2.3
%
,
P
=
0.020
)
and
renal
failure
(
9.7
%
vs
1.7
%
,
P
=
0.002
)
were
also
more
common
in
Group
T
,
in
the
primary
valve
surgery
subgroup
.

On
the
contrary
,
among
primary
coronary
artery
bypass
surgery
patients
,
there
were
more
acute
myocardial
infarctions
and
renal
dysfunction
in
Group
A
(
5.8
%
vs
2.0
%
,
P
=
0.027
;
22.5
%
vs
15.2
%
,
P
=
0.036
,
respectively
)
.

The
1-yr
mortality
was
significantly
higher
after
aprotinin
treatment
in
the
high
risk
surgery
group
(
17.7
%
vs
9.8
%
,
P
=
0.034
)
.

CONCLUSION
:
Both
antifibrinolytic
drugs
bear
the
risk
of
adverse
outcome
depending
on
the
type
of
cardiac
surgery
.

Administration
of
aprotinin
should
be
avoided
in
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
and
high
risk
patients
,
whereas
administration
of
tranexamic
acid
is
not
recommended
in
valve
surgery
.

The
biological
properties
of
the
optical
isomers
of
propranolol
and
their
effects
on
cardiac
arrhythmias
.

1
.

The
optical
isomers
of
propranolol
have
been
compared
for
their
beta
-
blocking
and
antiarrhythmic
activities.2
.

In
blocking
the
positive
inotropic
and
chronotropic
responses
to
isoprenaline
,
(
+
)
-
propranolol
had
less
than
one
hundredth
the
potency
of
(
-)-
propranolol
.

At
dose
levels
of
(
+
)
-
propranolol
which
attenuated
the
responses
to
isoprenaline
,
there
was
a
significant
prolongation
of
the
PR
interval
of
the
electrocardiogram.3
.

The
metabolic
responses
to
isoprenaline
in
dogs
(
an
increase
in
circulating

glucose
,
lactate
and
free
fatty
acids
)
were
all
blocked
by
(

-)-
propranolol
.

(
+
)
-
Propranolol
had
no
effect
on
fatty
acid
mobilization
but
significantly
reduced
the
increments
in
both
lactate
and
glucose
.4
.

Both
isomers
of
propranolol
possessed
similar
depressant
potency
on
isolated
atrial
muscle
taken
from
guinea
-
pigs.5
.

The
isomers
of
propranolol
exhibited
similar
local
anaesthetic
potencies
on
an
isolated
frog
nerve
preparation
at
a
level
approximately
three
times
that
of
procaine
.

The
racemic
compound
was
significantly
less
potent
than
either
isomer.6
.

Both
isomers
of
propranolol
were
capable
of
preventing
adrenaline
-induced

cardiac
arrhythmias
in
cats
anaesthetized
with
halothane
,
but
the
mean
dose
of
(
-)-
propranolol
was
0.09+/-0.02
mg
/
kg
whereas
that
of
(
+
)
-
propranolol
was
4.2+/-1.2
mg
/
kg
.

At
the
effective
dose
level
of
(
+
)
-
propranolol
there
was
a
significant
prolongation
of
the
PR
interval
of
the
electrocardiogram
.

Blockade
of

arrhythmias
with
both
isomers
was
surmountable
by
increasing
the
dose
of
adrenaline
.7
.

Both
isomers
of
propranolol
were
also
capable
of
reversing
ventricular
tachycardia
caused
by
ouabain
in
anaesthetized
cats
and
dogs
.

The
dose
of
(
-)-
propranolol
was
significantly
smaller
than
that
of
(
+
)
-
propranolol
in
both
species
but
much
higher
than
that
required
to
produce
evidence
of
beta
-
blockade.8
.

The
implications
of
these
results
are
discussed
.

Topotecan
in
combination
with
radiotherapy
in
unresectable
glioblastoma
:
a
phase
2
study
.

Improving
glioblastoma
multiforme

(
GBM
)
treatment
with
radio
-
chemotherapy
remains
a
challenge
.

Topotecan
is
an
attractive
option
as
it
exhibits
growth
inhibition
of
human
glioma
as
well
as
brain
penetration
.

The
present
study
assessed
the
combination
of
radiotherapy
(
60
Gy/30
fractions/40
days
)
and
topotecan
(
0.9
mg
/
m(2)/day
on
days
1
-
5
on
weeks
1
,
3
and
5
)
in
50
adults
with
histologically
proven
and
untreated
GBM
.

The
incidence
of
non
-
hematological
toxicities
was
low
and
grade
3
-
4
hematological

toxicities
were
reported
in
20
patients
(
mainly
lymphopenia
and
neutropenia
)
.

Partial
response
and
stabilization
rates
were
2
%
and
32
%
,
respectively
,
with
an
overall
time
to
progression
of
12
weeks
.

One
-
year
overall
survival
(
OS
)
rate
was
42
%
,
with
a
median
OS
of
40
weeks
.

Topotecan
in
combination
with
radiotherapy
was
well
tolerated
.

However
,
while
response
and
stabilization
concerned
one
-
third
of
the
patients
,
the
study
did
not
show
increased
benefits
in
terms
of
survival
in
patients
with
unresectable
GBM
.

Long
-
term

lithium
therapy
leading
to
hyperparathyroidism
:
a
case
report
.

PURPOSE
:

This
paper
reviews
the
effect
of
chronic
lithium
therapy
on
serum
calcium
level
and
parathyroid
glands
,
its
pathogenesis
,
and
treatment
options
.

We
examined
the
case
of
a
lithium
-treated
patient
who
had
recurrent
hypercalcemia
to
better
understand
the
disease
process
.

CONCLUSION
:

Primary
hyperparathyroidism
is
a
rare
but
potentially
life
-
threatening
side
effect
of
long
-
term
lithium
therapy
.

Careful
patient
selection
and
long
-
term
follow
-
up
can
reduce
morbidity
.

PRACTICAL
IMPLICATIONS
:
As
much
as
15
%
of

lithium

-treated
patients
become
hypercalcemic
.

By
routinely
monitoring
serum
calcium
levels
,
healthcare
providers
can
improve
the
quality
of
life
of
this
patient
group
.

Comparison
of
laryngeal
mask
with
endotracheal
tube
for
anesthesia
in
endoscopic
sinus
surgery
.

BACKGROUND
:

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
compare
surgical
conditions
,
including
the
amount
of
intraoperative
bleeding
as
well
as
intraoperative
blood
pressure
,
during
functional
endoscopic
sinus
surgery
(
FESS
)
using
flexible
reinforced
laryngeal
mask
airway
(
FRLMA
)
versus
endotracheal
tube
(
ETT
)
in
maintaining
controlled
hypotension
anesthesia
induced
by
propofol
-
remifentanil
total
i.v
.
anesthesia
(
TIVA
)
.

METHODS
:

Sixty
normotensive
American
Society
of
Anesthesiologists
I
-
II
adult
patients
undergoing
FESS
under
controlled
hypotension
anesthesia
caused
by
propofol
-
remifentanil
-TIVA
were
randomly
assigned
into
two
groups
:
group
I
,
FRLMA
;
group
II
,
ETT
.

Hemorrhage
was
measured
and
the
visibility
of
the
operative
field
was
evaluated
according
to
a
six
-
point
scale
.

RESULTS
:
Controlled

hypotension
was
achieved
within
a
shorter
period
using
laryngeal
mask
using
lower
rates
of
remifentanil
infusion
and
lower
total
dose
of
remifentanil
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
summary
,
our
results
indicate
that
airway
management
using
FRLMA
during
controlled
hypotension
anesthesia
provided
better
surgical
conditions
in
terms
of
quality
of
operative
field
and
blood
loss
and
allowed
for
convenient
induced
hypotension
with
low
doses
of
remifentanil
during
TIVA
in
patients
undergoing
FESS
.

Nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
during
valproate
therapy
.

Valproic
acid

(
VPA
)
is
effective
for
the
treatment
of
many
types
of
epilepsy
,
but
its
use
can
be
associated
with
an
increase
in
body
weight
.

We
report
a
case
of
nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease

(
NAFLD
)
arising
in
a
child
who
developed
obesity
during
VPA
treatment
.

Laboratory
data
revealed
hyperinsulinemia
with
insulin
resistance
.

After
the
withdrawal
of
VPA
therapy
,
our
patient
showed
a
significant
weight
loss
,
a
decrease
of
body
mass
index
,
and
normalization
of
metabolic
and
endocrine
parameters
;
moreover
,
ultrasound
measurements
showed
a
complete
normalization
.

The
present
case
suggests
that
obesity
,
hyperinsulinemia
,
insulin
resistance
,
and
long
-
term
treatment
with
VPA
may
be
all
associated
with
the
development
of
NAFLD
;
this
side
effect
is
reversible
after
VPA
withdrawal
.

Carbimazole
induced

ANCA
positive
vasculitis
.

Anti
-
thyroid
drugs
,
like
carbimazole
and
propylthiouracil

(
PTU
)
are
commonly
prescribed
for
the
treatment
of
hyperthyroidism
.

One
should
be
aware
of
the
side
effects
of
antithyroid
medications
.

Antineutrophil
cytoplasmic
antibody
(
ANCA)--associated
vasculitis
is
a
potentially
life
-
threatening
adverse
effect
of
antithyroidmedications
.

We
report
a
patient
with
Graves
'
disease
who
developed
ANCA
positive
carbimazole
induced
vasculitis
.

The
episode
was
characterized
by
a
vasculitic
skin
rash
associated
with
large
joint
arthritis
,
pyrexia
and
parotiditis
but
no
renal
or
pulmonary
involvement
.

He
was
referred
to
us
for
neurological
evaluation
because
he
had
difficulty
in
getting
up
from
squatting
position
and
was
suspected
to
have
myositis
.

Carbimazole
and
methimazole
have
a
lower
incidence
of
reported
ANCA
positive
side
effects
than
PUT
.

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
ANCA
positive
carbimazole
induced
vasculitis
case
reported
from
India
.

Aspirin
for
the
primary
prevention
of
cardiovascular
events
:
an
update
of
the
evidence
for
the
U.S.
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
.

BACKGROUND
:

Coronary
heart
disease
and
cerebrovascular
disease
are
leading
causes
of
death
in
the
United
States
.

In
2002
,
the
U.S.
Preventive
Services
Task
Force
(
USPSTF
)
strongly
recommended
that
clinicians
discuss
aspirin
with
adults
who
are
at
increased
risk
for
coronary
heart
disease
.

PURPOSE
:

To
determine
the
benefits
and
harms
of
taking
aspirin
for
the
primary
prevention
of
myocardial
infarctions
,
strokes
,
and
death
.

DATA
SOURCES
:
MEDLINE
and
Cochrane
Library
(

2001
to
28
August
2008
)
,
recent

.

STUDY
SELECTION
:

English
-
language
randomized
,
controlled
trials
(
RCTs
)
;
case
-
control
studies
;
meta
-
analyses
;
and
systematic
reviews
of
aspirin
versus
control
for
the
primary
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease

(
CVD
)
were
selected
to
answer
the
following
questions
:
Does
aspirin
decrease
coronary
heart
events
,
strokes
,
death
from
coronary
heart
events
or
stroke
,
or
all
-
cause
mortality
in
adults
without
known
CVD
?

Does
aspirin
increase

gastrointestinal
bleeding
or
hemorrhagic
strokes
?

DATA
EXTRACTION
:

All
studies
were
reviewed
,
abstracted
,
and
rated
for
quality
by
using
predefined
USPSTF
criteria
.

DATA
SYNTHESIS
:

New
evidence
from
1
good
-
quality
RCT
,
1
good
-
quality
meta
-
analysis
,
and
2
fair
-
quality
subanalyses
of
RCTs
demonstrates
that
aspirin
use
reduces
the
number
of
CVD
events
in
patients
without
known
CVD
.

Men
in
these
studies
experienced
fewer
myocardial
infarctions
and
women
experienced
fewer
ischemic
strokes
.

Aspirin
does
not
seem
to
affect
CVD
mortality
or
all
-
cause
mortality
in
either
men
or
women
.

The
use
of
aspirin
for
primary
prevention
increases
the
risk
for
major
bleeding
events
,
primarily
gastrointestinal
bleeding
events
,
in
both
men
and
women
.

Men
have
an
increased
risk
for
hemorrhagic
strokes
with
aspirin
use
.

A
new
RCT
and
meta
-
analysis
suggest
that
the
risk
for
hemorrhagic
strokes
in
women
is
not
statistically
significantly
increased
.

LIMITATIONS
:

New
evidence
on
aspirin
for
the
primary
prevention
of
CVD
is
limited
.

The
dose
of
aspirin
used
in
the
RCTs
varied
,
which
prevented
the
estimation
of
the
most
appropriate
dose
for
primary
prevention
.

Several
of
the
RCTs
were
conducted
within
populations
of
health
professionals
,
which
potentially
limits
generalizability
.

CONCLUSION
:

Aspirin
reduces
the
risk
for
myocardial
infarction
in
men
and
strokes
in
women
.

Aspirin
use
increases
the
risk
for
serious
bleeding
events
.

Reducing
harm
associated
with
anticoagulation
:
practical
considerations
of
argatroban
therapy
in
heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
.

Argatroban
is
a
hepatically
metabolized
,
direct
thrombin
inhibitor
used
for
prophylaxis
or
treatment
of
thrombosis
in

heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia

(
HIT
)
and
for
patients
with
or
at
risk
of
HIT
undergoing
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
(
PCI
)
.

The
objective
of
this
review
is
to
summarize
practical
considerations
of
argatroban
therapy
in
HIT
.

The
US
FDA
-
recommended
argatroban
dose
in

HIT
is
2
microg
/
kg
/
min
(
reduced
in
patients
with
hepatic
impairment
and
in
paediatric
patients
)
,
adjusted
to
achieve
activated
partial
thromboplastin
times
(
aPTTs
)
1.5
-
3
times
baseline
(
not
>
100
seconds
)
.

Contemporary
experiences
indicate
that
reduced
doses
are
also
needed
in
patients
with
conditions
associated
with
hepatic
hypoperfusion
,
e.g.
heart
failure
,
yet
are
unnecessary
for
renal
dysfunction
,
adult
age
,
sex
,
race
/
ethnicity
or
obesity
.

Argatroban
0.5
-
1.2
microg
/
kg
/
min
typically
supports
therapeutic
aPTTs
.

The
FDA
-
recommended
dose
during
PCI
is
25
microg
/
kg
/
min
(
350
microg
/
kg
initial
bolus
)
,
adjusted
to
achieve
activated
clotting
times
(
ACTs
)
of
300
-
450
sec
.

For
PCI
,
argatroban
has
not
been
investigated
in
hepatically
impaired
patients
;
dose
adjustment
is
unnecessary
for
adult
age
,
sex
,
race
/
ethnicity
or
obesity
,
and
lesser
doses
may
be
adequate
with
concurrent
glycoprotein
IIb
/
IIIa
inhibition
.

Argatroban
prolongs
the
International
Normalized
Ratio
,
and
published
approaches
for
monitoring
the
argatroban
-to-
warfarin
transition
should
be
followed
.

Major
bleeding
with
argatroban
is
0
-
10
%
in
the
non
-
interventional
setting
and
0
-
5.8
%
periprocedurally
.

Argatroban
has
no
specific
antidote
,
and
if
excessive
anticoagulation
occurs
,
argatroban
infusion
should
be
stopped
or
reduced
.

Improved
familiarity
of
healthcare
professionals
with
argatroban
therapy
in
HIT
,
including
in
special
populations
and
during
PCI
,
may
facilitate
reduction
of
harm
associated
with
HIT

(
e.g.
fewer
thromboses
)
or
its
treatment
(
e.g.
fewer
argatroban
medication
errors
)
.

complications
associated
with
heroin
abuse
,
some
of
which
are
life
-
threatening
.

Methadone
may
aggravate
this
problem
.

METHOD
:

A
clinical
case
description
.

RESULTS
:

A
33-year
-
old
man
presented
with
rhabdomyolysis
and
cerebral
ischemic
stroke
after
intravenous
heroin
.

He
had
used
heroin
since
age
20
,
and
had
used
150
mg
methadone
daily
for
6
months
.

He
was
found

unconsciousness
at
home
and
was
sent
to
our
hospital
.

In
the
ER
,
his
opiate
level
was
4497
ng
/
ml
.

In
the
ICU
,
we
found
rhabdomyolysis
,
acute
renal
failure
and
acute
respiratory
failure
.

After
transfer
to
an
internal
ward
,
we
noted
aphasia
and
weakness
of
his
left
limbs
.

After
MRI
,
we
found
cerebral
ischemic
infarction
.

CONCLUSION
:

Those
using
methadone
and
heroin
simultaneously
may
increase
risk
of
rhabdomyolysis
and
ischemic
stroke
.

Patients
under
methadone

maintenance
therapy
should
be
warned
regarding
these
serious
adverse
events
.

Hypotheses
of
heroin
-related

rhabdomyolysis
and
stroke
in
heroin
abusers
are
discussed
.

Increased
vulnerability
to
6-hydroxydopamine
lesion
and
reduced
development
of
dyskinesias
in
mice
lacking
CB1
cannabinoid
receptors
.

Motor
impairment
,
dopamine

(
DA
)
neuronal
activity
and
proenkephalin
(
PENK
)
gene
expression
in
the
caudate
-
putamen
(
CPu
)
were
measured
in
6-OHDA
-lesioned
and
treated
(
L
-
DOPA+benserazide
)

CB1
KO
and
WT
mice
.

A
lesion
induced
by
6-OHDA
produced
more
severe
motor
deterioration
in
CB1
KO
mice
accompanied
by
more
loss
of
DA
neurons
and
increased
PENK
gene
expression
in
the
CPu
.

Oxidative
/
nitrosative
and
neuroinflammatory
parameters
were
estimated
in
the
CPu
and
cingulate
cortex
(
Cg
)
.

CB1
KO
mice
exhibited
higher
MDA
levels
and
iNOS
protein
expression
in
the
CPu
and
Cg
compared
to
WT
mice
.

Treatment
with
L
-
DOPA+benserazide

(
12
weeks
)
resulted
in
less
severe
dyskinesias
in
CB1
KO
than
in
WT
mice
.

The
results
revealed
that
the
lack
of
cannabinoid
CB1
receptors
increased
the
severity
of
motor
impairment
and
DA
lesion
,
and
reduced

L
-
DOPA
-induced

dyskinesias
.

These
results
suggest
that
activation
of
CB1
receptors
offers
neuroprotection
against
dopaminergic
lesion
and
the
development
of
L
-
DOPA
-induced
dyskinesias
.

Animal
model
of
mania
induced
by
ouabain
:

Evidence
of
oxidative
stress
in
submitochondrial
particles
of
the
rat
brain
.

The
intracerebroventricular
(
ICV
)
administration
of
ouabain

(
a
Na
(
+
)

/
K
(
+
)
-ATPase
inhibitor
)
in
rats
has
been
suggested
to
mimic
some
symptoms
of
human
bipolar
mania
.

Clinical
studies
have
shown
that
bipolar
disorder
may
be
related
to
mitochondrial
dysfunction
.

Herein
,
we
investigated
the
behavioral
and
biochemical
effects
induced
by
the
ICV
administration
of
ouabain
in
rats
.

To
achieve
this
aim
,
the
effects
of
ouabain
injection
immediately
after
and
7
days
following
a
single
ICV
administration
(
at
concentrations
of
10(-2
)
and
10(-3)M
)
on
locomotion
was
measured
using
the
open
-
field
test
.

Additionally
,
thiobarbituric
acid
reactive
substances
(
TBARSs
)
and
superoxide
production
were
measured
in
submitochondrial
particles
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
hippocampus
,
striatum
and
amygdala
.

Our
findings
demonstrated
that
ouabain
at
10(-2
)
and
10(-3)M
induced
hyperlocomotion
in
rats
,
and
this
response
remained
up
to
7
days
following
a
single
ICV
injection
.

In
addition
,
we
observed
that
the
persistent
increase
in
the
rat
spontaneous
locomotion
is
associated
with
increased
TBARS
levels
and
superoxide
generation
in
submitochondrial
particles
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
striatum
and
amygdala
.

In
conclusion
,
ouabain
-induced

mania
-like
behavior
may
provide
a
useful
animal
model
to
test
the
hypothesis
of
the
involvement
of
oxidative
stress
in
bipolar
disorder
.

Intraoperative
dialysis
during
liver
transplantation
with
citrate
dialysate
.

Liver
transplantation
for
acutely
ill
patients
with
fulminant
liver
failure
carries
high
intraoperative
and
immediate
postoperative
risks
.

These
are
increased
with
the
presence
of
concomitant
acute
kidney
injury
(
AKI
)
and
intraoperative
dialysis
is
sometimes
required
to
allow
the
transplant
to
proceed
.

The
derangements
in
the
procoagulant
and
anticoagulant
pathways
during
fulminant
liver
failure
can
lead
to
difficulties
with
anticoagulation
during
dialysis
,
especially
when
continued
in
the
operating
room
.

Systemic
anticoagulation
is
unsafe
and
regional
citrate
anticoagulation
in
the
absence
of
a
functional
liver
carries
the
risk
of
citrate
toxicity
.

Citrate
dialysate
,
a
new
dialysate
with
citric
acid
can
be
used
for
anticoagulation
in
patients
who
can
not
tolerate
heparin
or
regional
citrate
.

We
report
a
case
of
a
40-year
-
old
female
with
acetaminophen
-induced
fulminant
liver
failure
with
associated
AKI
who
underwent
intraoperative
dialytic
support
during
liver
transplantation
anticoagulated
with
citrate
dialysate
during
the
entire
procedure
.

The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
well
without
any
signs
of
citrate
toxicity
and
maintained
adequate
anticoagulation
for
patency
of
the
dialysis
circuit
.

Citrate

dialysate
is
a
safe
alternative
for
intradialytic
support
of
liver
transplantation
in
fulminant
liver
failure
.

Delirium
in
a
patient
with
toxic
flecainide
plasma
concentrations
:
the
role
of
a
pharmacokinetic
drug
interaction
with
paroxetine
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
describe
a
case
of
flecainide
-induced
delirium
associated
with
a
pharmacokinetic
drug
interaction
with
paroxetine
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
69-year
-
old
white
female
presented
to
the
emergency
department
with
a
history
of
confusion
and
paranoia
over
the
past
several
days
.

On
admission
the
patient
was
taking

carvedilol
12
mg
twice
daily
,
warfarin
2
mg
/
day
,
folic
acid
1
mg
/
day
,
levothyroxine
100
microg
/
day
,
pantoprazole
40
mg
/
day
,
paroxetine
40
mg
/
day
,
and
flecainide
100
mg
twice
daily
.

Flecainide
had
been
started
2
weeks
prior
for
atrial
fibrillation
.

Laboratory
test
findings
on
admission
were
notable
only
for
a
flecainide
plasma
concentration
of
1360
microg
/
L
(
reference
range
200
-
1000
)
.

A
metabolic
drug
interaction
between
flecainide
and
paroxetine
,
which
the
patient
had
been
taking
for
more
than
5
years
,
was
considered
.

Paroxetine
was
discontinued
and
the
dose
of

flecainide
was
reduced
to
50
mg
twice
daily
.

Her

delirium
resolved
3
days
later
.

DISCUSSION
:

Flecainide
and
pharmacologically
similar
agents
that
interact
with
sodium
channels
may
cause
delirium
in
susceptible
patients
.

A
MEDLINE
search
(
1966-January
2009
)
revealed
one
in
vivo
pharmacokinetic
study
on
the
interaction
between
flecainide
,
a
CYP2D6
substrate
,
and
paroxetine
,
a
CYP2D6
inhibitor
,
as
well
as
3
case
reports
of
flecainide

-induced
delirium
.

According
to
the
Naranjo
probability
scale
,
flecainide
was
the
probable
cause
of
the
patient
's
delirium
;
the
Horn
Drug
Interaction
Probability
Scale
indicates
a
possible
pharmacokinetic
drug
interaction
between
flecainide
and
paroxetine
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Supratherapeutic
flecainide

plasma
concentrations
may
cause
delirium
.

Because
toxicity
may
occur
when
flecainide
is
prescribed
with
paroxetine
and
other
potent
CYP2D6
inhibitors
,
flecainide
plasma
concentrations
should
be
monitored
closely
with
commencement
of
CYP2D6
inhibitors
.

Efficacy
of
everolimus

(
RAD001
)
in
patients
with
advanced
NSCLC
previously
treated
with
chemotherapy
alone
or
with
chemotherapy
and
EGFR
inhibitors
.

BACKGROUND
:

Treatment
options
are
scarce
in
pretreated
advanced
non
-
small
-
cell
lung
cancer

(
NSCLC
)
patients
.

RAD001
,
an
oral
inhibitor
of
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin

(
mTOR
)
,
has
shown
phase
I
efficacy
in
NSCLC
.

METHODS
:
Stage
IIIb
or
IV
NSCLC
patients
,
with
two
or
fewer
prior
chemotherapy
regimens
,
one
platinum

based
(
stratum
1
)
or
both
chemotherapy
and
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
(
stratum
2
)
,
received
RAD001

10
mg
/
day
until
progression
or
unacceptable
toxicity
.

Primary
objective
was
overall
response
rate
(
ORR
)
.

Analyses
of
markers
associated
with
the
mTOR
pathway
were
carried
out
on
archival
tumor
from
a
subgroup
using
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
and
direct
mutation
sequencing
.

RESULTS
:

Eighty
-
five
patients
were
enrolled
,
42
in
stratum
1
and
43
in
stratum
.

ORR
was
4.7
%
(
7.1
%
stratum
1
;
2.3
%
stratum
2
)
.

Overall
disease
control
rate
was
47.1
%
.

Median
progression
-
free
survivals
(
PFSs
)
were
2.6
(
stratum
1
)
and
2.7
months
(
stratum
2
)
.

Common
>
or
=
grade
3
events
were
fatigue
,
dyspnea
,
stomatitis
,
anemia
,
and
thrombocytopenia
.

Pneumonitis
,
probably
or
possibly
related
,
mainly
grade
1/2
,
occurred
in
25
%
.

Cox
regression
analysis
of
IHC
scores
found
that
only
phospho
AKT
(
pAKT
)
was
a
significant
independent
predictor
of
worse
PFS
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

RAD001
10
mg
/
day
was
well
tolerated
,
showing
modest
clinical
activity
in
pretreated
NSCLC
.

Evaluation
of
RAD001
plus
standard
therapy
for
metastatic
NSCLC
continues
.

Posttransplant
anemia
:
the
role
of
sirolimus
.

Posttransplant
anemia
is
a
common
problem
that
may
hinder
patients
'
quality
of
life
.

It
occurs
in
12
to
76
%
of
patients
,
and
is
most
common
in
the
immediate
posttransplant
period
.

A
variety
of
factors
have
been
identified
that
increase
the
risk
of
posttransplant
anemia
,
of
which
the
level
of
renal
function
is
most
important
.

Sirolimus
,
a
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
inhibitor
,
has
been
implicated
as
playing
a
special
role
in
posttransplant
anemia
.

This
review
considers

anemia
associated
with
sirolimus
,
including
its
presentation
,
mechanisms
,
and
management
.

Coronary
computerized
tomography
angiography
for
rapid
discharge
of
low
-
risk
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

chest
pain
.

BACKGROUND
:

Most
patients
presenting
to
emergency
departments
(
EDs
)
with
cocaine
-associated

chest
pain
are
admitted
for
at
least
12
hours
and
receive
a
"
rule
out
acute
coronary
syndrome
"
protocol
,
often
with
noninvasive
testing
prior
to
discharge
.

In
patients
without
cocaine
use
,
coronary
computerized
tomography
angiography
(
CTA
)
has
been
shown
to
be
useful
for
identifying
a
group
of
patients
at
low
risk
for
cardiac
events
who
can
be
safely
discharged
.

It
is
unclear
whether
a
coronary
CTA
strategy
would
be
efficacious
in
cocaine

-associated

chest
pain
,
as
coronary
vasospasm
may
account
for
some
of
the
ischemia
.

We
studied
whether
a
negative
coronary
CTA
in
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

chest
pain
could
identify
a
subset
safe
for
discharge
.

METHODS
:

We
prospectively
evaluated
the
safety
of
coronary
CTA
for
low
-
risk
patients
who
presented
to
the
ED
with
cocaineassociated
chest
pain

(
self
-
reported
or
positive
urine
test
)
.

Consecutive
patients
received
either
immediate
coronary
CTA
in
the
ED
(
without
serial
markers
)
or
underwent
coronary
CTA
after
a
brief
observation
period
with
serial
cardiac
marker
measurements
.

Patients
with
negative
coronary
CTA
(
maximal
stenosis
less
than
50
%
)
were
discharged
.

The
main
outcome
was
30-day
cardiovascular
death
or
myocardial
infarction
.

RESULTS
:

A
total
of
59
patients
with
cocaine

-associated

chest
pain
were
evaluated
.

Patients
had
a
mean
age
of
45.6
+
/-

6.6
yrs
and
were
86
%
black
,
66
%
male
.

Seventy
-
nine
percent
had
a
normal
or
nonspecific
ECG
and
85
%
had
a
TIMI
score
2
.

Twenty
patients
received
coronary
CTA
immediately
in
the
ED
,
18
of
whom
were
discharged
following
CTA
(
90
%
)
.

Thirty
-
nine
received
coronary
CTA
after
a
brief
observation
period
,
with
37
discharged
home
following
CTA
(
95
%
)
.

Six
patients
had
coronary
stenosis

>

or=50
%
.

During
the
30-day
follow
-
up
period
,
no
patients
died
of
a
cardiovascular
event
(
0
%
;
95
%
CI
,
0
-
6.1
%
)
and
no
patient
sustained
a
nonfatal
myocardial
infarction

(
0
%
;
95
%
CI
,
0
-
6.1
%
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Although
cocaine
-associated
myocardial
ischemia
can
result
from
coronary
vasoconstriction
,
patients
with
cocaine
associated
chest
pain
,
a
non-
ischemic
ECG
,
and
a
TIMI
risk
score
2
may
be
safely
discharged
from
the
ED
after
a
negative
coronary
CTA
with
a
low
risk
of
30-day
adverse
events
.

Late
fulminant
posterior
reversible
encephalopathy
syndrome
after
liver
transplant
.

OBJECTIVES
:

Posterior
leukoencephalopathy
due
to
calcineurin
-
inhibitor
-
related
neurotoxicity
is
a
rare
but
severe
complication
that
results
from
treatment
with
immunosuppressive
agents
(
primarily
those
administered
after
a
liver
or
kidney
transplant
)
.

The
pathophysiologic
mechanisms
of
that
disorder
remain
unknown
.

CASE
:

We
report
the
case
of
a
46-year
-
old
woman
who
received
a
liver
transplant
in
our
center
as
treatment
for
alcoholic
cirrhosis
and
in
whom
either
a
fulminant
course
of
posterior
leukoencephalopathy
or
posterior
reversible
encephalopathy
syndrome
developed
110
days
after
transplant
.

After
an
initially
uneventful
course
after
the
transplant
,
the
patient
rapidly
fell
into
deep
coma
.

RESULTS
:

Cerebral
MRI
scan
showed
typical
signs
of
enhancement
in
the
pontine
and
posterior
regions
.

Switching
the
immunosuppressive
regimen
from
tacrolimus
to
cyclosporine
did
not
improve
the
clinical
situation
.

The
termination
of
treatment
with
any
calcineurin
inhibitor
resulted
in
a
complete
resolution
of
that
complication
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Posterior
reversible
encephalopathy
syndrome
after
liver
transplant
is
rare
.

We
recommend
a
complete
cessation
of
any
calcineurin
inhibitor
rather
than
a
dose
reduction
.

Prolonged
hypothermia
as
a
bridge
to
recovery
for
cerebral
edema
and
intracranial
hypertension
associated
with
fulminant
hepatic
failure
.

BACKGROUND
:

To
review
evidence
-
based
treatment
options
in
patients
with
cerebral
edema

complicating
fulminant
hepatic
failure

(
FHF
)
and
discuss
the
potential
applications
of
hypothermia
.

METHOD
:

Case
-
based
observations
from
a
medical
intensive
care
unit
(
MICU
)
in
a
tertiary
care
facility
in
a
27-year
-
old
female
with
FHF
from
acetaminophen
and
resultant
cerebral
edema
.

RESULTS
:

Our
patient
was
admitted
to
the
MICU
after
being
found
unresponsive
with
presumed
toxicity
from
acetaminophen
which
was
ingested
over
a
2-day
period
.

The
patient
had
depressed
of
mental
status
lasting
at
least
24
h
prior
to
admission
.

Initial
evaluation
confirmed
FHF
from
acetaminophen
and
cerebral
edema
.

The
patient
was
treated
with
hyperosmolar
therapy
,
hyperventilation
,
sedation
,
and
chemical
paralysis
.

Her
intracranial
pressure
remained
elevated
despite
maximal
medical
therapy
.

We
then
initiated
therapeutic
hypothermia
which
was
continued
for
5
days
.

At
re
-
warming
,
patient
had
resolution
of
her
cerebral
edema
and
intracranial
hypertension
.

At
discharge
,
she
had
complete
recovery
of
neurological
and
hepatic
functions
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
patients
with
FHF
and
cerebral
edema
from
acetaminophen

overdose
,
prolonged
therapeutic
hypothermia
could
potentially
be
used
as
a
life
saving
therapy
and
a
bridge
to
hepatic
and
neurological
recovery
.

A
clinical
trial
of
hypothermia
in
patients
with
this
condition
is
warranted
.

Binasal

This
study
investigated
the
visual

vigabatrin

(
VGB
)
.

Two

were
grouped
on
the

Smoking
of
crack
cocaine
as
a
risk
factor
for
HIV
infection
among
people
who
use
injection
drugs
.

BACKGROUND
:

Little
is
known
about
the
possible
role
that
smoking

crack
cocaine
has
on
the
incidence
of
HIV
infection
.

Given
the
increasing
use
of
crack
cocaine
,
we
sought
to
examine
whether
use
of
this
illicit
drug
has
become
a
risk
factor
for
HIV
infection
.

METHODS
:

We
included
data
from
people
participating
in
the
Vancouver
Injection
Drug
Users
Study
who
reported
injecting
illicit
drugs
at
least
once
in
the
month
before
enrolment
,
lived
in
the
greater
Vancouver
area
,
were
HIV
-
negative
at
enrolment
and
completed
at
least
1
follow
-
up
study
visit
.

To
determine
whether
the
risk
of
HIV
seroconversion
among
daily
smokers
of
crack
cocaine
changed
over
time
,
we
used
Cox
proportional
hazards
regression
and
divided
the
study
into
3
periods
:
May
1
,
1996-Nov
.

30
,
1999
(

,
2002
(

,
and
Dec.

,
2002-Dec
.

30
,
2005
(
period
3
)
.

RESULTS
:

Overall
,
1048
eligible
injection
drug
users
were
included
in
our
study
.

Of
these
,
137
acquired

HIV
infection
during
follow
-
up
.

The
mean
proportion
of
participants
who
reported
daily
smoking
of
crack
cocaine
increased
from
11.6
%
in
period
1
to
39.7
%
in
period
3
.

After
adjusting
for
potential
confounders
,
we
found
that
the
risk
of
HIV
seroconversion
among
participants
who
were
daily
smokers
of
crack
cocaine
increased
over
time
(

.

INTERPRETATION
:

Smoking
of
crack
cocaine
was
found
to
be
an
independent
risk
factor
for
HIV
seroconversion
among
people
who
were
injection
drug
users
.

This
finding
points
to
the
urgent
need
for
evidence
-

public
health
initiatives
targeted
at
people
who
smoke
crack
cocaine
.

Fluoxetine
improves
the
memory
deficits
caused
by
the
chemotherapy
agent
5-fluorouracil
.

Cancer
patients
who
have
been
treated
with
systemic
adjuvant
chemotherapy
have
described
experiencing
deteriorations
in
cognition
.

A
widely
used
chemotherapeutic
agent
,
5-fluorouracil

(
5-FU
)
,
readily
crosses
the
blood
-
brain
barrier
and
so
could
have
a
direct
effect
on
brain
function
.

In
particular
this
anti
mitotic
drug
could
reduce
cell
proliferation
in
the
neurogenic
regions
of
the
adult
brain
.

In
contrast
reports
indicate
that
hippocampal
dependent
neurogenesis
and
cognition
are
enhanced
by
the
SSRI
antidepressant
Fluoxetine
.

In
this
investigation
the
behavioural
effects
of
chronic
(
two
week
)
treatment
with
5-FU
and

(
three
weeks
)
with
Fluoxetine
either
separately
or
in
combination
with
5-FU
were
tested
on
adult
Lister
hooded
rats
.

Behavioural
effects
were
tested
using
a
context
dependent
conditioned
emotional
response
test
(
CER
)
which
showed
that
animals
treated
with
5-FU
had
a
significant
reduction
in
freezing
time
compared
to
controls
.

A
separate
group
of
animals
was
tested
using
a
hippocampal
dependent
spatial
working
memory
test
,
the
object
location
recognition
test
(
OLR
)
.

Animals
treated
only
with
5-FU
showed
significant
deficits
in
their
ability
to
carry
out
the
OLR
task
but
co
administration
of
Fluoxetine
improved
their
performance
.

5-FU
chemotherapy
caused
a
significant
reduction
in
the
number
of
proliferating
cells
in
the
sub
granular
zone
of
the
dentate
gyrus
compared
to
controls
.

This
reduction
was
eliminated
when
Fluoxetine
was
co
administered
with
5-FU
.

Fluoxetine
on
its
own
had
no
effect
on
proliferating
cell
number
or
behaviour
.

These
findings
suggest
that
5-FU
can
negatively
affect
both
cell
proliferation
and
hippocampal
dependent
working
memory
and
that
these
deficits
can
be
reversed
by
the
simultaneous
administration
of
the
antidepressant
Fluoxetine
.

Liver
-
specific
ablation
of
integrin
-
linked
kinase
in
mice
results
in
enhanced
and
prolonged
cell
proliferation
and
hepatomegaly
after
phenobarbital
administration
.

We
have
recently
demonstrated
that
disruption
of
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM)/integrin
signaling
via
elimination
of
integrin
-
linked
kinase
(
ILK
)
in
hepatocytes
interferes
with
signals
leading
to
termination
of
liver
regeneration
.

This
study
investigates
the
role
of
ILK
in
liver
enlargement
induced
by
phenobarbital

(
PB
)
.

Wild
-
type
(
WT
)
and
ILK
:

liver-/-
mice
were
given
PB
(
0.1
%
in
drinking
water
)
for
10
days
.

Livers
were
harvested
on
2
,
5
,
and
10
days
during
PB
administration
.

In
the
hepatocyte
-
specific
ILK
/
liver-/-
mice
,
the
liver
:
body
weight
ratio
was
more
than
double
as
compared
to
0
h
at
day
2
(
2.5
times
)
,
while
at
days
5
and
10
,
it
was
enlarged
three
times
.

In
the
WT
mice
,
the
increase
was
as
expected
from
previous
literature
(
1.8
times
)
and
seems
to
have
leveled
off
after
day
2
.

There
were
slightly
increased
proliferating
cell
nuclear
antigen
-
positive
cells
in
the
ILK
/
liver-/-
animals
at
day
2
as
compared
to
WT
after
PB
administration
.

In
the
WT
animals
,
the
proliferative
response
had
come
back
to
normal
by
days
5
and
10
.

Hepatocytes
of
the
ILK
/
liver-/-
mice
continued
to
proliferate
up
until
day
10
.

ILK
/
liver-/-
mice
also
showed
increased
expression
of
key
genes
involved
in
hepatocyte
proliferation
at
different
time
points
during
PB
administration
.

In
summary
,
ECM
proteins
communicate
with
the
signaling
machinery
of
dividing
cells
via
ILK
to
regulate
hepatocyte
proliferation
and
termination
of
the
proliferative
response
.

Lack
of
ILK
in
the
hepatocytes
imparts
prolonged
proliferative
response
not
only
to
stimuli
related
to
liver
regeneration
but
also
to
xenobiotic
chemical
mitogens
,
such
as
PB
.

The
present
study
was
aimed
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
altered
regulation
of
tubular
transporters
in
gentamicin
-induced
nephropathy
.

Sprague

Dawley
male
rats
(
200~250
g
)
were
subcutaneously
injected
with
gentamicin

(
100
mg

per
day
)
for
7
days
,
and
the
expression
of
tubular
transporters
was
determined
by
immunoblotting
and
immunohistochemistry
.

The
mRNA
and
protein
expression
of
OAT
was
also
determined
.

Gentamicin

-treated
rats
exhibited
significantly
decreased
creatinine
clearance
along
with
increased
plasma
creatinine
levels
.

Accordingly
,
the
fractional
excretion
of
sodium
increased
.

Urine
volume
was
increased
,
while
urine
osmolality
and
free
water
reabsorption
were
decreased
.

Immunoblotting
and
immunohistochemistry
revealed
decreased

)

-ATPase
,
NHE3
,

,
and

in
the
kidney
of

gentamicin
-treated
rats
.

The
expression
of
OAT1
and

was
also
decreased
.

Gentamicin

Longitudinal
association
of
alcohol
use
with
HIV
disease
progression
and
psychological
health
of
women
with
HIV
.

We
evaluated
the
association
of
alcohol
consumption
and
depression
,
and
their
effects
on
HIV
disease
progression
among
women
with
HIV
.

The
study
included
871
women
with
HIV
who
were
recruited
from
1993
-
1995
in
four
US
cities
.

The
participants
had

,

,
and
venipuncture
,
CD4+T

,
measurement
of

(
using
the

)
,
and
alcohol
use
assessment
at
enrollment
,
and
semiannually
until
March
2000
.

Multilevel
random
coefficient
ordinal
models
as
well
as
multilevel
models
with
joint
responses
were
used
in
the
analysis
.

There
was
no
significant
association
between
level
of
alcohol
use
and
CD4
+
T
-
cell
counts
.

When
participants
were
stratified
by
antiretroviral
therapy
(
ART
)
use
,
the
association
between
alcohol
and
CD4
+
T
-
cell
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
.

The
association
between
alcohol
consumption
and
depression
was
significant
(
p<0.001
)
.

Depression
had
a
significant
negative
effect
on
CD4
+
T
-
cell
counts
over
time
regardless
of
ART
use
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
alcohol
consumption
has
a
direct
association
with
depression
.

Moreover
,
depression
is
associated
with
HIV
disease
progression
.

Our
findings
have
implications
for
the
provision
of
alcohol

interventions
and
psychological
resources
to
improve
the
health
of

Chemokine
CCL2
and
its
receptor
CCR2
are
increased
in
the
hippocampus
following
pilocarpine

-induced

status
epilepticus
.

BACKGROUND
:

Neuroinflammation
occurs
after
seizures
and
is
implicated
in
epileptogenesis
.

CCR2
is
a
chemokine
receptor
for
CCL2
and
their
interaction
mediates
monocyte
infiltration
in
the
neuroinflammatory
cascade
triggered
in
different
brain
pathologies
.

In
this
work
CCR2
and
CCL2
expression
were
examined
following
status
epilepticus

(
SE
)
induced
by
pilocarpine
injection
.

METHODS
:

SE
was
induced
by
pilocarpine
injection
.

Control
rats
were
injected
with
saline
instead
of
pilocarpine
.

Five
days
after
SE
,
CCR2
staining
in
neurons
and
glial
cells
was
examined
using
imunohistochemical
analyses
.

The
number
of
CCR2
positive
cells
was
determined
using
stereology
probes
in
the
hippocampus
.

CCL2
expression
in
the
hippocampus
was
examined
by
molecular
assay
.

RESULTS
:

Increased
CCR2
was
observed
in
the
hippocampus
after
SE
.

Seizures
also
resulted
in
alterations
to
the
cell
types
expressing
CCR2
.

Increased
numbers
of
neurons
that
expressed
CCR2
was
observed
following
SE
.

Microglial
cells
were
more
closely
apposed
to
the
CCR2-labeled
cells
in
SE
rats
.

In
addition
,
rats
that
experienced
SE
exhibited
CCR2-labeling
in
populations
of
hypertrophied
astrocytes
,
especially
in
CA1
and
dentate
gyrus
.

These
CCR2
+
astroctytes
were
not
observed
in
control
rats
.

Examination
of
CCL2
expression
showed
that
it
was
elevated
in
the
hippocampus
following
SE
.

CONCLUSION
:

The
data
show
that
CCR2
and
CCL2
are
up
-
regulated
in
the
hippocampus
after
pilocarpine

-induced
SE
.

Seizures
also
result
in
changes
to
CCR2
receptor
expression
in
neurons
and
astrocytes
.

These
changes
might
be
involved
in
detrimental
neuroplasticity
and
neuroinflammatory
changes
that
occur
following
seizures
.

Metallothionein
induction
reduces
caspase-3
activity
and
TNFalpha
levels
with
preservation
of
cognitive
function
and
intact
hippocampal
neurons
in
carmustine
-treated
rats
.

Hippocampal
integrity
is
essential
for
cognitive
functions
.

On
the
other
hand
,
induction
of
metallothionein

(
MT
)
by

ZnSO(4
)
and
its
role
in
neuroprotection
has
been
documented
.

The
present
study
aimed
to
explore
the
effect
of
MT
induction
on
carmustine

(
BCNU
)
-induced
hippocampal
cognitive
dysfunction
in
rats
.

A
total
of
60
male
Wistar
albino
rats
were
randomly
divided
into
four
groups
(
15/group
)
:
The
control
group
injected
with
single
doses
of
normal
saline
(
i.c.v
)
followed
24
h
later
by
BCNU
solvent
(
i.v
)
.

The
second
group
administered

ZnSO(4
)
(
0.1
micromol/10
microl
normal
saline
,
i.c.v
,
once
)
then
BCNU
solvent
(
i.v
)
after
24
h.
Third
group
received
BCNU

(
20
mg
/
kg
,
i.v
,
once
)
24
h
after
injection
with
normal
saline
(
i.c.v
)
.

Fourth
group
received
a
single
dose
of
ZnSO(4
)

(
0.1
micromol/10
microl

normal
saline
,
i.c.v
)
then
BCNU

(
20
mg
/
kg
,
i.v
,
once
)
after
24
h.

The
obtained
data
revealed
that
BCNU
administration
resulted
in
deterioration
of
learning
and
short
-
term
memory
(
STM
)
,
as
measured
by
using
radial
arm
water
maze
,
accompanied
with
decreased
hippocampal
glutathione
reductase
(
GR
)
activity
and
reduced
glutathione

(
GSH
)
content
.

Also
,
BCNU
administration
increased
serum
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
,
hippocampal
MT
and
malondialdehyde

(
MDA
)
contents
as
well
as
caspase-3
activity
in
addition
to
histological
alterations
.

ZnSO(4
)
pretreatment
counteracted

BCNU
-induced
inhibition
of
GR
and
depletion
of
GSH
and
resulted
in
significant
reduction
in
the
levels
of
MDA
and
TNFalpha
as
well
as
the
activity
of
caspase-3
.

The
histological
features
were
improved
in
hippocampus
of
rats
treated
with
ZnSO(4
)
+
BCNU
compared
to
only
BCNU
-treated
animals
.

In
conclusion
,
MT
induction
halts
BCNU
-induced
hippocampal
toxicity
as
it
prevented
GR
inhibition
and
GSH
depletion
and
counteracted
the
increased
levels
of
TNFalpha
,
MDA
and
caspase-3
activity
with
subsequent
preservation
of
cognition
.

Fatal
carbamazepine
induced
fulminant

)
myocarditis
:
emphasis
on
anatomical
and
histological
characteristics
,
mechanisms
and
genetics
of
drug
hypersensitivity
and
differential
diagnosis
.

The
most
severe
adverse
reactions
to
carbamazepine
have
been
observed
in
the
haemopoietic
system
,
the
liver
and
the
cardiovascular
system
.

A
frequently
fatal
,
although
exceptionally
rare
side
effect
of
carbamazepine
is
necrotizing
eosinophilic
(
hypersensitivity
)
myocarditis
.

We
report
a
case
of
hypersensitivity
myocarditis
secondary
to
administration
of
carbamazepine
.

Acute
hypersensitivity
myocarditis
was
not
suspected
clinically
,
and
the
diagnosis
was
made
post
-
mortem
.

Histology
revealed
diffuse
infiltration
of
the
myocardium
by
eosinophils
and
lymphocytes
with
myocyte
damage
.

Clinically
,
death
was
due
to
cardiogenic
shock
.

To
best
of
our
knowledge
this
is
the
second
case
of
fatal
carbamazepine
induced
myocarditis
reported
in
English
literature
.

Neuropsychiatric
behaviors
in
the
MPTP

marmoset
model
of
Parkinson
's
disease
.

OBJECTIVES
:

Neuropsychiatric
symptoms
are
increasingly
recognised
as
a
significant
problem
in
patients
with
Parkinson
's
disease

(
PD
)
.

These
symptoms
may
be
due
to
'
sensitisation
'
following
repeated
levodopa
treatment
or
a
direct
effect
of
dopamine
on
the
disease
state
.

The
levodopa
-treated
MPTP
-lesioned
marmoset
was
used
as
a
model
of
neuropsychiatric
symptoms
in
PD
patients
.

Here
we
compare
the
time
course
of
levodopa
-induced
motor
fluctuations
and
neuropsychiatric
-
like
behaviors
to
determine
the
relationship
between
duration
of
treatment
and
onset
of
symptoms
.

METHODS
:

Marmosets
were
administered
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine

(
2.0
mg
/
kg
s.c
.
)

for
five
days
,
resulting
in
stable
parkinsonism
.

Levodopa
(
15
mg
/

and
benserazide
,
3.75
mg
/

)
p.o
.

b.i.d
,
was
administered
for
30
days
.

Animals
were
evaluated
for
parkinsonian
disability
,
dyskinesia
and
on
-
time
(
motor
fluctuations
)
and
neuropsychiatric
-
like
behaviors
on
Day
0
(
prior
to
levodopa
)
and
on
Days
1
,
7
,
13
,
27
and
30
of
treatment
using
post
hoc
DVD
analysis
by
a
trained
rater
,
blind
to
the
treatment
day
.

RESULTS
:

The
neuropsychiatric
-
like
behavior
rating
scale
demonstrated
high
interrater
reliability
between
three
trained
raters
of
differing
professional
backgrounds
.

As
anticipated
,
animals
exhibited
a
progressive
increase
in
levodopa
-induced
motor
fluctuations
,

dyskinesia
and
wearing
-
off
,
that
correlated
with
the
duration
of
levodopa
therapy
.

In
contrast
,
levodopa
-induced

neuropsychiatric
-
like
behaviors
were
present
on
Day
1
of
levodopa
treatment
and
their
severity
did
not
correlate
with
duration
of
treatment
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
data
suggest
that
neuropsychiatric
disorders
in
PD
are
more
likely
an
interaction
between
levodopa
and
the
disease
state
than
a
consequence
of
sensitisation
to
repeated
dopaminergic
therapy
.

Contrast
medium

nephrotoxicity
after
renal
artery
and
coronary
angioplasty
.

BACKGROUND
:

Renal
dysfunction
induced
by
iodinated
contrast
medium

(
CM
)
administration
can
minimize
the
benefit
of
the
interventional
procedure
in
patients
undergoing
renal
angioplasty
(
PTRA
)
.

PURPOSE
:

To
compare
the
susceptibility
to
nephrotoxic
effect
of
CM
in
patients
undergoing
PTRA
with
that
of
patients
submitted
to
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
(
PCI
)
.

MATERIAL
AND
METHODS
:

A
total
of
33
patients
successfully
treated
with
PTRA
(
PTRA
group
,
mean
age
70+/-12
years
,
23
female
,
basal
creatinine

1.46+/-0.79
,
range
0.7
-
4.9
mg
/
dl
)
were
compared
with
33
patients
undergoing
successful
PCI
(
PCI
group
)
,
matched
for
basal
creatinine

(
1.44+/-0.6
,
range
0.7
-
3.4
mg
/
dl
)
,
gender
,
and
age
.

In
both
groups
postprocedural
(
48
h
)
serum
creatinine
was
measured
.

RESULTS
:

Postprocedural
creatinine
level
decreased
nonsignificantly
in
the
PTRA
group
(
1.46+/-0.8
vs.
1.34+/-0.5
mg
/
dl
,
P
=
NS
)
and
increased
significantly
in
the
PCI
group
(
1.44+/-0.6
vs.
1.57+/-0.7
mg
/
dl
,
P<0.02
)
.

Changes
in
serum
creatinine
after
intervention
(
after
-
before
)
were
significantly
different
between
the
PTRA
and
PCI
groups

(
-0.12+/-0.5
vs.
0.13+/-0.3
,
P=0.014
)
.

This
difference
was
not
related
to
either
a
different
clinical
risk
profile
or
to
the
volume
of
CM
administered
.

CONCLUSION
:

In
this
preliminary
study
patients
submitted
to
PTRA
showed
a
lower
susceptibility
to
renal
damage
induced
by
CM
administration
than
PCI
patients
.

The
effectiveness
of
PTRA
on
renal
function
seems
to
be
barely
influenced
by
CM
toxicity
.

Medical
and
psychiatric
outcomes
for
patients
transplanted
for
acetaminophen

-induced

acute
liver
failure
:
a
case
-
control
study
.

BACKGROUND
:

Acetaminophen
-induced

hepatotoxicity
is
the
most
common
cause
of
acute
liver
failure

(
ALF
)
in
the
UK
.

Patients
often
consume
the
drug
with
suicidal
intent
or
with
a
background
of
substance
dependence
.

AIMS
AND
METHODS
:

We
compared
the
severity
of
pretransplant
illness
,
psychiatric
co
-
morbidity
,
medical
and
psychosocial
outcomes
of
all
patients
who
had
undergone
liver
transplantation
(
LT
)
emergently
between
1999
-
2004
for

acetaminophen
-induced

ALF

(
n=36
)
with
age-
and
sex
-
matched
patients
undergoing
emergent
LT
for
non-
acetaminophen
-induced

ALF
(
n=35
)
and
elective
LT
for
chronic
liver
disease

(
CLD
,
n=34
)
.

RESULTS
:

Acetaminophen
-induced

ALF
patients
undergoing
LT
had
a
greater
severity
of
pre

LT
illness
reflected
by
higher
Acute
Physiology
and
Chronic
Health
Evaluation
II
scores
and
requirement
for
organ
support
compared
with
the
other
two
groups
.

Twenty
(
56
%
)
acetaminophen
-induced

ALF
patients
had
a
formal
psychiatric
diagnosis
before
LT
(
non-
acetaminophen

,
CLD
=
2/34
;
P<0.01
for
all
)
and
nine
(
25

)
had
a
previous
suicide
attempt
.

During
follow

(
median
5
years
)
,
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
rejection
(
acute

between
the
groups
(

)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Despite
a
high
prevalence
of
psychiatric
disturbance
,
outcomes
for
patients
transplanted
emergently
for
acetaminophen
-induced

ALF
were
comparable
to
those
transplanted
for
non-
acetaminophen
-induced
ALF
and
electively
for
CLD
.

Multidisciplinary
approaches
with
long
-
term
psychiatric
follow
-
up
may
contribute
to
low
post
-
transplant
suicide
rates
seen
and
low
rates
of
graft
loss
because
of
non

compliance
.

Studies
of
synergy
between
morphine
and
a
novel
sodium
channel
blocker
,
CNSB002
,
in
rat
models
of
inflammatory
and
neuropathic
pain
.

OBJECTIVE
:

This
study
determined
the
antihyperalgesic
effect
of
CNSB002
,
a
sodium
channel
blocker
with
antioxidant
properties
given
alone
and
in
combinations
with
morphine
in
rat
models
of
inflammatory
and
neuropathic
pain
.

DESIGN
:

Dose
response
curves
for
nonsedating
doses
of
morphine
and
CNSB002
given
intraperitoneally
alone
and
together
in
combinations
were
constructed
for
antihyperalgesic
effect
using
paw
withdrawal
from
noxious
heat
in
two
rat
pain
models
:
carrageenan
-induced
paw
inflammation
and
streptozotocin

(
STZ
)
-induced
diabetic
neuropathy
.

RESULTS
:

The
maximum
nonsedating
doses
were
:
morphine
,
3.2
mg
/
kg
;
CNSB002
10.0
mg
/
kg
;
5.0
mg
/
kg
CNSB002
with
morphine

3.2
mg
/
kg
in
combination
.

The
doses
calculated
to
cause
50
%
reversal
of
hyperalgesia

(
ED50
)
were
7.54
(
1.81
)
and
4.83
(
1.54
)
in
the
carrageenan
model
and
44.18

(
1.37
)
and
9.14
(
1.24
)
in

the
STZ
-induced

neuropathy
model
for
CNSB002
and
morphine
,
respectively
(
mg
/
kg
;
mean
,
SEM
)
.

These
values
were
greater
than
the
maximum
nonsedating
doses
.

The
ED50
values
for
morphine
when
given
in
combination
with
CNSB002

(
5
mg
/
kg
)
were
less
than
the
maximum
nonsedating
dose
:
0.56
(
1.55
)
in
the
carrageenan
model
and
1.37
(
1.23
)
in
the
neuropathy
model
(
mg
/
kg
;
mean
,
SEM
)
.

The
antinociception
after
morphine

(
3.2
mg
/
kg
)
was
increased
by
co
-
administration
with
CNSB002
from
28.0
and
31.7
%
to
114.6
and
56.9
%
reversal
of
hyperalgesia
in
the
inflammatory
and
neuropathic
models
,
respectively
(
P
0.01
;

one
-
way
analysis
of
variance
-
significantly
greater
than
either
drug
given
alone
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

The
maximum
antihyperalgesic
effect
achievable
with
nonsedating
doses
of

morphine
may
be
increased
significantly
when
the
drug
is
used
in
combination
with
CNSB002
.

Heparin
-induced
thrombocytopenia
:
a
practical
review
.

Heparin
-induced

thrombocytopenia

(
HIT
)
remains
under
-
recognized
despite
its
potentially
devastating
outcomes
.

It
begins
when
heparin
exposure
stimulates
the
formation
of

heparin
-platelet
factor
4
antibodies
,
which
in
turn
triggers
the
release
of
procoagulant
platelet
particles
.

Thrombosis
and
thrombocytopenia

that
follow
comprise
the
2
hallmark
traits
of
HIT
,
with
the
former
largely
responsible
for
significant
vascular
complications
.

The
prevalence
of
HIT
varies
among
several
subgroups
,
with
greater
incidence
in
surgical
as
compared
with
medical
populations
.

HIT
must
be
acknowledged
for
its
intense
predilection
for
thrombosis
and
suspected
whenever
thrombosis
occurs
after
heparin
exposure
.

Early
recognition
that
incorporates
the
clinical
and
serologic
clues
is
paramount
to
timely
institution
of
treatment
,
as
its
delay
may
result
in
catastrophic
outcomes
.

The
treatment
of
HIT
mandates
an
immediate
cessation
of
all
heparin
exposure
and
the
institution
of
an
antithrombotic
therapy
,
most
commonly
using
a
direct
thrombin
inhibitor
.

Current
"
diagnostic
"
tests
,
which
primarily
include
functional
and
antigenic
assays
,
have
more
of
a
confirmatory
than
diagnostic
role
in
the
management
of
HIT
.

Special
attention
must
be
paid
to
cardiac
patients
who
are
often
exposed
to
heparin
multiple
times
during
their
course
of
treatment
.

Direct
thrombin
inhibitors
are
appropriate
,
evidence
-
based
alternatives
to
heparin
in
patients
with
a
history
of
HIT
,
who
need
to
undergo
percutaneous
coronary
intervention
.

As
heparin
remains
one
of
the
most
frequently
used
medications
today
with
potential
for
HIT
with
every
heparin
exposure
,
a
close
vigilance
of
platelet
counts
must
be
practiced
whenever
heparin
is
initiated
.

Abductor
paralysis
after
botox
injection
for
adductor
spasmodic
dysphonia
.

OBJECTIVES
/
HYPOTHESIS
:

Botulinum
toxin
(
Botox
)
injections
into
the
thyroarytenoid
muscles
are
the
current
standard
of
care
for
adductor
spasmodic
dysphonia

(
ADSD
)
.

Reported
adverse
effects
include
a
period
of
breathiness
,
throat
pain
,
and
difficulty
with
swallowing
liquids
.

Here
we
report
multiple
cases
of
bilateral
abductor
paralysis
following
Botox
injections
for
ADSD
,
a
complication
previously
unreported
.

STUDY
DESIGN
:

Retrospective
case
series
.

METHODS
:
Patients
that
received
Botox
injections
for
spasmodic
dysphonia
between
January
2000
and
October
2009
were
evaluated
.

Patients
with
ADSD
were
identified
.

The
number
of
treatments
received
and
adverse
effects
were
noted
.

For
patients
with
bilateral
abductor
paralysis
,
age
,
sex
,
paralytic
Botox
dose
,
prior
Botox
dose
,
and
course
following
paralysis
were
noted
.

RESULTS
:

From
a
database
of
452
patients
receiving
Botox
,
352
patients
had
been
diagnosed
with
ADSD
.

Of
these
352
patients
,
eight
patients
suffered
bilateral
abductor
paralysis
,
and
two
suffered
this
complication
twice
.

All
affected
patients
were
females
over
the
age
of
50
years
.

Most
patients
had
received
treatments
prior
to
abductor
paralysis
and
continued
receiving
after
paralysis
.

Seven
patients
recovered
after
a
brief
period
of
activity
restrictions
,
and
one
underwent
a
tracheotomy
.

The
incidence
of
abductor
paralysis
after
Botox
injection
for
ADSD
was
0.34
%
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Bilateral
abductor

paralysis
is
a
rare
complication
of
Botox
injections
for
ADSD
,
causing
difficulty
with
breathing
upon
exertion
.

The
likely
mechanism
of
paralysis
is
diffusion
of
Botox
around
the
muscular
process
of
the
arytenoid
to
the
posterior
cricoarytenoid
muscles
.

The
paralysis
is
temporary
,
and
watchful
waiting
with
restriction
of
activity
is
the
recommended
management
.

Mitochondrial
impairment
contributes
to
cocaine

-induced

cardiac
dysfunction
:

Prevention
by
the
targeted
antioxidant
MitoQ
.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
assess
mitochondrial
function
and
ROS
production
in
an
experimental
model
of
cocaine

-induced

cardiac
dysfunction
.

We
hypothesized
that
cocaine
abuse
may
lead
to
altered
mitochondrial
function
that
in
turn
may
cause
left
ventricular
dysfunction
.

Seven
days
of
cocaine
administration
to
rats
led
to
an
increased
oxygen
consumption
detected
in
cardiac
fibers
,
specifically
through
complex
I
and
complex
III
.

ROS
levels
were
increased
,
specifically
in
interfibrillar
mitochondria
.

In
parallel
there
was
a
decrease
in
ATP
synthesis
,
whereas
no
difference
was
observed
in
subsarcolemmal
mitochondria
.

This
uncoupling
effect
on
oxidative
phosphorylation
was
not
detectable
after
short
-
term
exposure
to
cocaine
,
suggesting
that
these
mitochondrial
abnormalities
were
a
late
rather
than
a
primary
event
in
the
pathological
response
to
cocaine
.

MitoQ
,
a
mitochondrial
-
targeted
antioxidant
,
was
shown
to
completely
prevent
these
mitochondrial
abnormalities
as
well
as
cardiac
dysfunction
characterized
here
by
a
diastolic
dysfunction
studied
with
a
conductance
catheter
to
obtain
pressure
-
volume
data
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
extend
previous
studies
and
demonstrate
that
cocaine
-induced
cardiac
dysfunction
may
be
due
to
a
mitochondrial
defect
.

Trimethoprim
-induced
immune
hemolytic
anemia
in
a
pediatric
oncology
patient
presenting
as
an
acute
hemolytic
transfusion
reaction
.

A
10-year
-
old
male
with
acute
leukemia
presented
with
post
-
chemotherapy
anemia
.

During
red
cell
transfusion
,
he
developed
hemoglobinuria
.

Transfusion
reaction
workup
was
negative
.

Drug
-
induced
immune
hemolytic
anemia
was
suspected
because
of
positive
direct
antiglobulin
test
,
negative
eluate
,
and
microspherocytes
on
smear
pre-
and
post
-
transfusion
.

Drug
studies
using
the
indirect
antiglobulin
test
were
strongly
positive
with
trimethoprim
and
trimethoprim
-
sulfamethoxazole
but
negative
with
sulfamethoxazole
.

The
patient
recovered
after
discontinuing
the
drug
,
with
no
recurrence
in
2
years
.

Other
causes
of
anemia
should
be
considered
in
patients
with
worse
-
than
-
expected
anemia
after
chemotherapy
.

Furthermore
,
hemolysis
during
transfusion
is
not
always
a
transfusion
reaction
.

Blockade
of
endothelial
-
mesenchymal
transition
by
a
Smad3
inhibitor
delays
the
early
development
of
streptozotocin
-induced
diabetic
nephropathy
.

OBJECTIVE
:

A
multicenter
,
controlled
trial
showed
that
early
blockade
of
the
renin-
angiotensin
system
in
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
and
normoalbuminuria
did
not
retard
the
progression
of
nephropathy
,
suggesting
that
other
mechanism(s
)
are
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
early
diabetic
nephropathy

(
diabetic
nephropathy
)
.

We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
endothelial
-
mesenchymal
-
transition
(
EndoMT
)
contributes
to
the
early
development
of
renal
interstitial
fibrosis
independently
of
microalbuminuria
in
mice
with
streptozotocin

(
STZ
)
-induced
diabetes
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
hypothesized
that
blocking
EndoMT
reduces
the
early
development
of
diabetic
nephropathy
.

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS

:
EndoMT
was
induced
in
a
mouse
pancreatic
microvascular
endothelial
cell
line
(
MMEC
)
in
the
presence
of
advanced
glycation
end
products
(
AGEs
)
and
in
the
endothelial
lineage
-
traceble
mouse
line
Tie2-Cre;Loxp
-
EGFP
by
administration
of
AGEs
,
with
nonglycated
mouse
albumin
serving
as
a
control
.

Phosphorylated
Smad3
was
detected
by
immunoprecipitation
/
Western
blotting
and
confocal
microscopy
.

Blocking
studies
using
receptor
for
AGE
siRNA
and
a
specific
inhibitor
of
Smad3
(
SIS3
)
were
performed
in
MMECs
and
in

STZ
-induced

diabetic
nephropathy
in
Tie2-Cre;Loxp
-
EGFP
mice
.

RESULTS
:

Confocal
microscopy
and
real
-
time
PCR
demonstrated
that
AGEs
induced
EndoMT
in
MMECs
and
in
Tie2-Cre;Loxp
-
EGFP
mice
.

Immunoprecipitation
/
Western
blotting
showed
that
Smad3
was
activated
by
AGEs
but
was
inhibited
by
SIS3
in
MMECs
and
in

STZ
-induced

diabetic
nephropathy
.

Confocal
microscopy
and
real
-
time
PCR
further
demonstrated
that
SIS3
abrogated
EndoMT
,
reduced
renal
fibrosis
,
and
retarded
progression
of
nephropathy
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

EndoMT
is
a
novel
pathway
leading
to
early
development
of
diabetic
nephropathy
.

Blockade
of
EndoMT
by
SIS3
may
provide
a
new
strategy
to
retard
the
progression
of
diabetic

Cytostatic
and
anti
-
angiogenic
effects
of
temsirolimus
in
refractory
mantle
cell
lymphoma
.

Mantle
cell
lymphoma

(
MCL
)
is
a
rare
and
aggressive
type
of
B
-
cell
non
-
Hodgkin
's
lymphoma
.

Patients
become
progressively
refractory
to
conventional
chemotherapy
,
and
their
prognosis
is
poor
.

However
,
a
38
%
remission
rate
has
been
recently
reported
in
refractory

MCL
treated
with
temsirolimus
,
a
mTOR
inhibitor
.

Here
we
had
the
opportunity
to
study
a
case
of
refractory
MCL
who
had

tumor
regression
two
months
after
temsirolimus
treatment
,
and
a
progression
-
free
survival
of
10
months
.

In
this
case
,
lymph
node
biopsies
were
performed
before
and
six
months
after
temsirolimus
therapy
.

Comparison
of
the
two
biopsies
showed
that
temsirolimus
inhibited
tumor
cell
proliferation
through
cell
cycle
arrest
,
but
did
not
induce
any
change
in
the
number
of
apoptotic
tumor
cells
.

Apart
from
this
cytostatic
effect
,
temsirolimus
had
an
antiangiogenic
effect
with
decrease
of
tumor
microvessel
density
and
of
VEGF
expression
.

Moreover
,
numerous
patchy
,
well
-
limited
fibrotic
areas
,
compatible
with
post-
necrotic
tissue
repair
,
were
found
after
6-month
temsirolimus
therapy
.

Thus
,
temsirolimus
reduced
tumor
burden
through
associated
cytostatic
and
anti
-
angiogenic
effects
.

This
dual
effect
of
temsirolimus
on
tumor
tissue
could
contribute
to
its
recently
reported
efficiency
in
refractory
MCL
resistant
to
conventional
chemotherapy
.

Syncope
caused
by
hyperkalemia
during
use
of
a
combined
therapy
with
the
angiotensin
-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
and
spironolactone
.

A
76
year
-
old
woman
with
a
history
of
coronary
artery
bypass
grafting
and
prior
myocardial
infarction
was
transferred
to
the
emergency
room
with
loss
of
consciousness
due
to
marked
bradycardia
caused
by
hyperkalemia
.

The
concentration
of
serum
potassium
was
high
,
and
normal
sinus
rhythm
was
restored
after
correction
of
the
serum
potassium
level
.

The
cause
of
hyperkalemia
was
considered
to
be
several
doses
of
spiranolactone
,
an
aldosterone
antagonist
,
in
addition
to
the
long
-
term
intake
of
ramipril
,
an
ACE
inhibitor
.

This
case
is
a
good
example
of
electrolyte
imbalance
causing
acute
life
-
threatening
cardiac
events
.

Clinicians
should
be
alert
to
the
possibility
of
hyperkalemia
,
especially
in
elderly
patients
using
ACE
/
ARB
in
combination
with
potassium
sparing
agents
and
who
have
mild
renal
disturbance
.

Diffuse
skeletal
pain
after
administration
of
alendronate
.

BACKGROUND
:

Osteoporosis
is
caused
by
bone
resorption
in
excess
of
bone
formation
,
and
bisphosphonates
,
are
used
to
inhibit
bone
resorption
.

Alendronate
,
a
biphosphonate
,
is
effective
for
both
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
osteoporosis
in
postmenopausal
women
.

Side
effects
are
relatively
few
and
prominently
gastrointestinal
.

Musculoskeletal
pain
may
be
an
important
side
effect
in
these
patients
.

We
presented
a
patient
admitted
to
our
out
-
patient
clinic
with
diffuse
skeletal
pain
after
three
consecutive
administration
of
alendronate
.

CONCLUSION
:

We
conclude
that
patients
with
osteoporosis
can
report
pain
,
and
bisphosphonate
-related

pain
should
also
be
considered
before
ascribing
this
complaint
to
osteoporosis
.

Cerebrospinal
fluid
penetration
of
high
-
dose
daptomycin
in
suspected
Staphylococcus
aureus
meningitis
.

OBJECTIVE
:

To
report
a
case
of
methicillin
-sensitive
Staphylococcus
aureus
(
MSSA
)

bacteremia
with
suspected
MSSA
meningitis
treated
with
high
-
dose
daptomycin
assessed
with
concurrent
serum
and
cerebrospinal
fluid
(
CSF
)
concentrations
.

CASE
SUMMARY
:

A
54-year
-
old
male
presented
to
the
emergency
department
with
generalized
weakness
and
presumed
health
-
care
-
associated
pneumonia
shown
on
chest
radiograph
.

Treatment
was
empirically
initiated
with
vancomycin
,
levofloxacin
,
and
piperacillin
/
tazobactam
.

Blood
cultures
revealed
S.
aureus
susceptible
to
oxacillin
.

Empiric
antibiotic
treatment
was
narrowed
to
nafcillin
on
day
4
.

On
day
8
,
the
patient
developed
acute
renal
failure

(
serum

creatinine
1.9
mg
/
dL
,
increased
from
1.2
mg
/
dL
the
previous
day
and
0.8
mg
/
dL
on
admission
)
.

The
patient
's
Glasgow
Coma
Score
was
3
,
with
normal
findings
shown
on
computed
tomography
scan
of
the
head
72
hours
following
an
episode
of
cardiac
arrest
on
day
10
.

The
patient
experienced
relapsing
MSSA
bacteremia
on
day
9
,
increasing
the
suspicion
for
a
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
infection
.

Nafcillin
was
discontinued
and
daptomycin
9
mg
/
kg
daily
was
initiated
for
suspected
meningitis
and
was
continued
until
the
patient
's
death
on
day
16
.

Daptomycin
serum
and
CSF
trough
concentrations
were
11.21
ug
/
mL
and
0.52
ug
/
mL
,
respectively
,
prior
to
the
third
dose
.

Lumbar
puncture
results
were
inconclusive
and
no
further
blood
cultures
were
positive
for
MSSA
.

Creatine
kinase
levels
were
normal
prior
to
daptomycin
therapy
and
were
not
reassessed
.

DISCUSSION
:

Daptomycin
was
initiated
in
our
patient
secondary
to
possible

nafcillin
-induced
acute
interstitial
nephritis
and
relapsing
bacteremia
.

At
a
dose
of
9
mg
/
kg
,
resultant
penetration
of
5
%
was
higher
than
in
previous
reports
,
more
consistent
with
inflamed
meninges
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

High
-
dose

daptomycin
may
be
an
alternative
option
for
MSSA
bacteremia
with
or
without
a
CNS
source
in
patients
who
have
failed
or
can
not
tolerate
standard
therapy
.

Further
clinical
evaluation
in
patients
with
confirmed

meningitis
is
warranted
.

The
role
of
nitric
oxide
in
convulsions
induced
by
lindane
in
rats
.

Lindane
is
an
organochloride
pesticide
and
scabicide
.

It
evokes

convulsions
mainly
trough
the
blockage
of
GABA
(
A
)
receptors
.

Nitric
oxide

(
NO
)
,
gaseous
neurotransmitter
,
has
contradictor
role
in
epileptogenesis
due
to
opposite
effects
of
L
-
arginine
,
precursor
of
NO
syntheses
(
NOS
)
,
and
L
-
NAME
(
NOS
inhibitor
)
observed
in
different
epilepsy
models
.

The
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
determine
the
effects
of
NO
on
the
behavioral
and
EEG
characteristics
of
lindane
-induced
epilepsy
in
male
Wistar
albino
rats
.

The
administration
of
L
-
arginine

(
600
,
800
and
1000
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)

in
dose
-
dependent
manner
significantly
increased
convulsion
incidence
and
severity
and
shortened
latency
time
to
first

convulsion
elicited
by
lower
lindane
dose
(
4
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
.

On
the
contrary
,
pretreatment
with
L
-
NAME

(
500
,
700
and
900
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
decreased
convulsion

incidence
and
severity
and
prolonged
latency
time
to
convulsion
following
injection
with
a
convulsive
dose
of
lindane

(
8
mg
/
kg
,
i.p
.
)
.

EEG
analyses
showed
increase
of
number
and
duration
of
ictal
periods
in
EEG
of
rats
receiving
l
-
arginine
prior
to
lindane
and
decrease
of
this
number
in
rats
pretreated
with
L
-
NAME
.

These
results
support
the
conclusion
that
NO
plays
a
role
of
endogenous
convulsant
in
rat
model
of
lindane
seizures
.

Long
-
term
oral
galactose

treatment
prevents

cognitive
deficits
in
male
Wistar
rats
treated
intracerebroventricularly
with
streptozotocin
.

Basic
and
clinical
research
has
demonstrated
that
dementia
of
sporadic
Alzheimer
's
disease

(
sAD
)
type
is
associated
with
dysfunction
of
the
insulin
-
receptor
(
IR
)
system
followed
by
decreased
glucose
transport
via
glucose

transporter
GLUT4
and
decreased
glucose
metabolism
in
brain
cells
.

An
alternative
source
of
energy
is
d
-
galactose

(
the
C-4-epimer
of
d
-
glucose
)
which
is
transported
into
the
brain
by
insulin
-
independent
GLUT3
transporter
where
it
might
be
metabolized
to
glucose
via
the
Leloir
pathway
.

Exclusively
parenteral
daily
injections
of
galactose
induce
memory
deterioration
in
rodents
and
are
used
to
generate
animal
aging
model
,
but
the
effects
of
oral
galactose
treatment
on
cognitive
functions
have
never
been
tested
.

We
have
investigated
the
effects
of
continuous
daily
oral
galactose

(
200
mg
/
kg
/
day
)
treatment
on
cognitive
deficits
in
streptozotocin

-induced

(
STZ
-icv
)
rat
model
of
sAD
,
tested
by
Morris
Water
Maze
and
Passive
Avoidance
test
,
respectively
.

One
month
of
oral
galactose
treatment
initiated
immediately
after
the
STZ
-icv
administration
,
successfully
prevented
development
of
the
STZ
-icv
-
induced
cognitive
deficits
.

Beneficial
effect
of
oral
galactose
was
independent
of
the
rat
age
and
of
the
galactose
dose
ranging
from
100
to
300
mg
/
kg
/
day
.

Additionally
,
oral
galactose
administration
led
to
the
appearance
of
galactose
in
the
blood
.

The
increase
of
galactose
concentration
in
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
was
several
times
lower
after
oral
than
after
parenteral
administration
of
the
same
galactose
dose
.

Oral
galactose
exposure
might
have
beneficial
effects
on
learning
and
memory
ability
and
could
be
worth
investigating
for
improvement
of
cognitive
deficits
associated
with
glucose
hypometabolism
in
AD
.
